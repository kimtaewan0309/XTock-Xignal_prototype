Ameren’s subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. Dividends on Ameren’s common stock and the payment of expenses by Ameren depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries.\nBelow is a summary description of Ameren’s principal subsidiaries – Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. Ameren also has other subsidiaries that conduct other activities, such as providing shared services. A more detailed description can be found in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nAmeren Missouri operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution business and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution business in Missouri.\nAmeren Illinois operates rate-regulated electric transmission, electric distribution, and natural gas distribution businesses in Illinois.\nATXI operates a FERC rate-regulated electric transmission business in the MISO.\nFor additional information about the development of our businesses, our business operations, and factors affecting our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nAmeren has four segments: Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Transmission. The Ameren Missouri segment includes all of the operations of Ameren Missouri. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution consists of the electric distribution business of Ameren Illinois. Ameren Illinois Natural Gas consists of the natural gas business of Ameren Illinois. Ameren Transmission primarily consists of the aggregated electric transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI.\nAmeren Missouri has one segment. Ameren Illinois has three segments: Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Illinois Transmission.\nAn illustration of the Ameren Companies’ reporting structures is provided below:\n(a) Ameren Missouri consolidates AMF, which is wholly owned by Ameren Missouri.\n(b) The Ameren Transmission segment also includes allocated Ameren (parent) interest charges, as well as other subsidiaries engaged in electric transmission project development and investment.\nRATES AND REGULATION\nThe rates that Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are allowed to charge for their utility services significantly influence the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of these companies and Ameren. The electric and natural gas utility industry is highly regulated. The utility rates charged to customers are determined by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC. Decisions by these entities are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, customer intervention, and economic conditions, as well as social and political views. Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding customer rates are largely outside of our control. These decisions, as well as the regulatory lag involved in the process of obtaining approval for new customer rates, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the Ameren Companies. The extent of the regulatory lag varies for each of Ameren’s electric and natural gas jurisdictions, with the Ameren Transmission business experiencing the least amount of regulatory lag. Depending on the jurisdiction, the effects of regulatory lag are mitigated by various means, including annual revenue requirement reconciliations, the decoupling of revenues from sales volumes to ensure revenues approved in a regulatory rate review are not affected by changes in sales volumes, the recovery of certain capital investments between traditional regulatory rate reviews, the level and timing of expenditures, the use of future test years to establish customer rates, and the use of trackers and riders.\nThe MoPSC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Missouri. The ICC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Illinois. The MoPSC and the ICC regulate non-rate utility matters for ATXI. ATXI does not have retail distribution customers; therefore, the MoPSC and the ICC do not have authority to regulate ATXI’s rates. The FERC regulates Ameren Missouri’s, Ameren Illinois’, and ATXI’s cost-based rates for the wholesale transmission and distribution of energy in interstate commerce and various other matters discussed below under General Regulatory Matters.\nThe following table summarizes the key terms of the rate orders in effect for customer billings for each of Ameren’s utilities as of January 1, 2025, except as noted:\nROE\nPortion of Ameren’s 2024 Operating Revenues\nNatural gas delivery service\nElectric distribution delivery service\nICC\nNatural gas delivery service\nICC\nElectric transmission service\nFERC\nATXI\nElectric transmission service\nFERC\nIncludes pass-through costs recovered from customers, such as purchased power for electric distribution delivery service and natural gas purchased for resale for natural gas delivery service, and intercompany eliminations.\nAmeren Missouri’s electric generation, transmission, and delivery service rates are bundled together and charged to retail customers under a combined electric service rate. Because the bundled rates charged to MoPSC retail customers include the revenue requirement associated with Ameren Missouri's FERC-regulated transmission services, the table above does not separately reflect a FERC-authorized rate base or allowed ROE.\nThis rate order did not specify an ROE, capital structure, or rate base.\nThis rate order did not specify an ROE or a capital structure.\nIn December 2024, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois’ MYRP proceeding. The order approved an average annual rate base for 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 of $4.2 billion, $4.4 billion, $4.6 billion, and $4.8 billion, respectively. Rate changes consistent with the December 2024 order became effective in late December 2024. Under an MYRP, Ameren Illinois will reconcile its actual revenue requirement, as adjusted for certain cost variations, to ICC-approved electric distribution service rates on an annual basis, subject to a reconciliation cap. The reconciliation cap limits the annual adjustment to 105% of the annual revenue requirement approved by the ICC.\nThis rate order was based on a 2024 future test year.\nTransmission rates are updated annually and become effective each January. They are determined by a company-specific, forward-looking formula ratemaking framework based on each year’s forecasted information. The 10.48% return, which includes a 50-basis-point incentive adder for participation in an RTO, is based on the FERC’s October 2024 order.\nFor additional information on Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI rate matters, see Results of Operations and Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nGeneral Regulatory Matters\nAmeren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive FERC approval to enter into various transactions, such as issuing short-term debt securities and conducting certain acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations. In addition, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive authorization from the applicable state public utility regulatory agency to issue stock and long-term debt securities and to conduct mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other activities.\nAmeren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are also subject to mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards adopted by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the bulk electric power system. These standards are developed and enforced by the NERC, pursuant to authority delegated to it by the FERC. Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are members of the SERC. The SERC is one of six regional entities and represents all or portions of 16 central and southeastern states under authority from the NERC for the purpose of implementing and enforcing reliability standards approved by the FERC. Ameren Missouri is also a member of the MRO, which is also one of the six regional entities and represents all or portions of 16 central, southern, and midwestern states, as well as two Canadian provinces, under authority from the NERC. The regional entities of the NERC work to safeguard the reliability of the bulk power systems throughout North America. If any of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, or ATXI is found not to be in compliance with these mandatory reliability standards, it could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.\nUnder the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, the FERC and the state public utility regulatory agencies in each state Ameren and its subsidiaries operate in may access books and records of Ameren and its subsidiaries that are found to be relevant to costs incurred by Ameren’s rate-regulated subsidiaries that may affect jurisdictional rates. The act also permits the MoPSC and the ICC to request that the FERC review cost allocations by Ameren Services to other Ameren subsidiaries.\nOperation of Ameren Missouri’s Callaway Energy Center is subject to regulation by the NRC. The license for the Callaway Energy Center expires in 2044. Ameren Missouri’s hydroelectric Osage Energy Center and pumped-storage hydroelectric Taum Sauk Energy Center, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to FERC regulations affecting, among other aspects, the general operation and maintenance of the projects. The licenses for the Osage Energy Center and the Taum Sauk Energy Center expire in 2047 and 2044, respectively. Ameren Missouri’s Keokuk Energy Center and its dam on the Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois, and Keokuk, Iowa,\nare operated under authority granted by an Act of Congress in 1905. The Keokuk Energy Center dam safety program is regulated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.\nFor additional information on regulatory matters, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 9 – Callaway Energy Center, and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur electric generation, transmission, and distribution and natural gas distribution and storage operations must comply with a variety of statutes and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety. These environmental statutes and regulations are comprehensive and include the storage, handling, and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances, emergency planning and response requirements, limitations and standards applicable to discharges from our facilities into the air or water that are enforced through permitting requirements, and natural resource protection laws, including those related to endangered species. Federal and state authorities periodically review and modify existing regulations and adopt new regulations, which may impact our planning process and the ultimate implementation of these or other new or revised regulations. Recent and potential new executive orders issued by the current federal administration as well as local and state land use requirements can also impact our planning activities.\nFor discussion of environmental matters",
  "item7_clean": "In February 2024, Ameren Illinois and ATXI filed a request for a CCN, among other things, with the ICC related to the portion of the MISO long-range transmission projects they will construct within the ICC’s jurisdiction.\nA decision by the ICC is expected by mid-2025. In 2024, ATXI filed requests for CCNs, among other things, with the MoPSC related to the MISO long-range transmission projects that it expects to construct within the MoPSC’s jurisdiction. Decisions by the MoPSC are expected in 2025. Also in December 2024, the MISO approved a first set of second tranche projects. A portion of these projects were assigned to Ameren and are estimated to cost approximately $1.3 billion, based on the MISO’s cost estimate. The first set of second tranche projects also includes competitive bid projects that are estimated to cost $6.5 billion, which includes projects located in Illinois that are estimated to cost $1.8 billion, based on the MISO’s cost estimate. The competitive bid process is expected to take place through 2026. The MISO is assessing future long-range transmission scenarios in the first quarter of 2025 and development of a second set of second tranche projects will follow this assessment.\nIn October 2024, the FERC issued an order, which decreased the allowed base ROE for FERC-regulated transmission rate base under the MISO tariff from 10.02% to 9.98% and required refunds, with interest, for the periods from November 2013 to February 2015 and from late September 2016 forward.\nIn November 2024, the MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI, filed a request for rehearing with the FERC, arguing, among other things, the FERC should not have ordered refunds back to September 2016 or imposed interest on those refunds. Also in November 2024, another intervenor filed a request for rehearing with the FERC, requesting the FERC correct aspects of the ROE methodology used in the October 2024 order and reconsider its decision in a February 2015 complaint case to deny refunds for the period from February 2015 to May 2016. In December 2024, the FERC issued a notice indicating a future order related to the rehearing requests will be issued but did not specify a timeline. In January 2025, the MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI, filed an appeal of the October 2024 order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\nAs a result of the October 2024 order, Ameren and Ameren Illinois recognized reductions to electric revenues of $10 million and $7 million, respectively, and recognized interest expense of $2 million and $1 million, respectively, on their statements of income in 2024.\nIn February 2024, Ameren’s board of directors increased the quarterly common stock dividend to 67 cents per share, resulting in an annualized equivalent dividend rate of $2.68 per share. In February 2025, Ameren’s board of directors increased the quarterly common stock dividend to 71 cents per share, resulting in an annualized equivalent dividend rate of $2.84 per share.\nFor further information on the matters discussed above, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report, and the Outlook section below.\nNet income attributable to Ameren common shareholders was $1,182 million, or $4.42 per diluted share, for 2024, and $1,152 million, or $4.38 per diluted share, for 2023. Net income was favorably affected in 2024, compared with 2023, by increased infrastructure investments at Ameren Transmission and Ameren Missouri. Net income was also favorably affected in 2024, compared with 2023, by increased base rate revenues pursuant to the MoPSC's June 2023 electric rate order as well as higher base rate revenues pursuant to the ICC's November 2023 natural gas rate order, which increased earnings at Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. Additionally, earnings in 2024, compared with 2023, were favorably affected by decreased other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to formula rates, riders, or trackers, largely because of lower energy center maintenance costs, lower storm costs, disciplined cost management including lower labor costs from decreased headcount and decreased use of contractors, and lower amortization of refueling costs for the Callaway Energy Center, partially offset by the absence of the regulatory deferrals associated with the June 2023 MoPSC rate order. Net income in 2024, compared with 2023, was also favorably affected by increased retail electric sales volumes at Ameren Missouri, primarily due to higher sales excluding customer energy-efficiency programs. Net income was unfavorably affected in 2024, compared with 2023, by two charges related to matters that originated over a decade ago. The first of these charges was recorded by Ameren Missouri\nrelated to an order from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, which resolved all outstanding claims in the NSR and Clean Air Ac\nt litigation related to the Rush Island Energy Center. The second charge was recognized by Ameren Illinois and ATXI for the decrease in the allowed base ROE under the MISO tariff resulting from the October 2024 FERC order, which included customer refunds for certain historical periods. Net income in 2024, compared with 2023, was also unfavorably affected by increased financing costs due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates at Ameren Missouri and Ameren (parent), a lower recognized ROE under the MYRP, and an increase in the weighted-average basic common shares outstanding, which reduced earnings per diluted share.\nAt December 31, 2024, Ameren, on a consolidated basis, had available liquidity in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under the Credit Agreements of $1.4 billion.\nAmeren has an ATM program under which Ameren may offer and sell from time to time common stock, which includes the ability to enter into forward sale agreements, subject to market conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2024, Ameren had approximately $550 million of common stock available for sale under the ATM program, which takes into account the forward sale agreements in effect as of December 31, 2024. For information regarding long-term debt issuances and maturities, common stock issuances, and outstanding forward sale agreements entered into under the ATM program through the date of this report, see Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nAmeren remains focused on strategic capital allocation. The following chart presents 2024 capital expenditures by segment and the midpoint of projected cumulative capital expenditures for 2025 through 2029 by segment:\n2024 Capital Expenditures by Segment\n(Total Ameren – $4.3 billion)\nMidpoint of 2025 – 2029 Projected Capital\nExpenditures by Segment (Total Ameren – $26.3 billion)\nAmeren Illinois Natural Gas\nAmeren Illinois Electric Distribution\nFor 2025 through 2029, Ameren’s cumulative capital expenditures are projected to range from $25.2 billion to $27.4 billion. The following table presents the range of projected spending by segment:\nAmeren Illinois Electric Distribution\nAmeren Illinois Natural Gas\nAmounts include investments under Ameren Missouri’s Smart Energy Plan.\ninclude the MISO long-range transmission projects assigned to Ameren, as well as the first tranche competitive projects awarded to ATXI discussed above\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Economic conditions, energy-efficiency investments by our customers and by us, technological advances, distributed generation, and the actions of key customers can significantly affect the demand for our services. Ameren and Ameren Missouri results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations in winter heating and summer cooling demands and by weather conditions, such as storms, as well as by energy center maintenance outages. Additionally, fluctuations in interest rates and conditions in the capital and credit markets affect our cost of borrowing, our pension and postretirement benefits costs, the cash surrender value of COLI, and the asset value of Ameren Missouri’s nuclear decommissioning trust fund. Almost all of Ameren’s revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. This regulation has a material impact on the rates we charge customers for our services. Our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity are affected by our ability to align our overall spending, both operating and capital, with the frameworks established by our regulators. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information regarding Ameren Missouri’s, Ameren Illinois’, and ATXI’s regulatory frameworks.\nAmeren Missouri principally uses coal and enriched uranium for fuel in its electric operations and purchases natural gas for its customers. Ameren Illinois purchases power and natural gas for its customers. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly because of the global economic and political environment, weather, supply, demand, inflation, and many other factors. We have natural gas\ncost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois and Missouri natural gas distribution businesses, a purchased power cost recovery mechanism for Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution business, and a FAC for Ameren Missouri’s electric business.\nWe employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risk and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of Ameren Missouri’s energy centers and our transmission and distribution systems and the level and timing of operations and maintenance costs and capital investment are key factors that we seek to manage in order to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nThe following table presents a summary of Ameren’s earnings for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nNet income attributable to Ameren common shareholders\n\nNet income attributable to Ameren common shareholders in 2024 increased $30 million, and $0.04 per diluted share, from 2023. The increase was due to net income increases of $27 million, $15 million, and $14 million at Ameren Transmission, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Missouri, respectively. The increases in net income were partially offset by a net income decrease of $24 million at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution and an increase in the net loss for activity not reported as part of a segment, primarily at Ameren (parent), of $2 million.\nEarnings per share in 2024, compared with 2023, were favorably affected by:\nincreased allowance for equity funds used during construction and increased base rate revenues for the inclusion of previously deferred PISA and RESRAM interest charges pursuant to the June 2023 MoPSC electric rate order effective July 9, 2023, and decreased interest charges resulting from higher deferrals related to infrastructure investments associated with the PISA and RESRAM, at Ameren Missouri (17 cents per share);\nincreased rate base investments at Ameren Transmission, which increased earnings in this segment (16 cents per share);\nincreased base rate revenues at Ameren Missouri effective July 9, 2023, pursuant to the June 2023 MoPSC electric rate order, partially offset by the net effect of amortization of previously deferred depreciation expense under the PISA and RESRAM, financing costs otherwise recoverable under the PISA and RESRAM, a lower base level of expenses included in trackers, and the net recovery for amounts associated with the reduction in sales volumes resulting from MEEIA programs (9 cents per share);\nincreased retail electric sales volumes at Ameren Missouri, primarily due to higher sales excluding customer energy-efficiency programs (estimated at 8 cents per share);\nincreased other income, net, primarily due to lower donations and a gain on the extinguishment of debt, see Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for more information, partially offset by decreased non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income not subject to formula rates or trackers largely due to lower investment returns (6 cents per share);\nincreased base rate revenues at Ameren Illinois Natural Gas effective November 28, 2023, pursuant to the November 2023 ICC natural gas rate order, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses included in base rates (4 cents per share); and\ndecreased other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to formula rates, riders, or trackers, excluding a charge related to the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation discussed below largely because of lower energy center maintenance costs, lower storm costs, disciplined cost management including lower labor costs from decreased headcount and decreased use of contractors, and lower amortization of refueling costs for the Callaway Energy Center, partially offset by the absence of regulatory deferrals associated with the June 2023 MoPSC rate order (2 cents per share).\nEarnings per share in 2024, compared with 2023, were unfavorably affected by:\na charge recorded by Ameren Missouri, included in other operation and maintenance expenses,\nrelated to an order from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, which resolved all outstanding claims in the NSR and Clean Air Ac\nt litigation related to the Rush Island Energy Center, see Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for more information (17 cents per share);\nincreased financing costs primarily at Ameren Missouri and Ameren (parent), largely due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates, partially offset by lower levels of short-term borrowings (17 cents per share);\nlower revenue at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution due to a lower recognized ROE under the MYRP (9 cents per share);\nincreased weighted-average basic common shares outstanding resulting from issuances of common shares (7 cents per share);\nthe result of the October 2024 FERC order reducing the allowed base ROE for FERC regulated transmission rate base under the MISO tariff, which decreased Ameren Transmission earnings (4 cents per share); and\nincreased taxes other than income taxes at Ameren Missouri, largely resulting from the absence in 2024 of employee retention tax credits received under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (2 cents per share).\nThe cents per share variances above are presented based on the weighted-average basic shares outstanding in 2023 and do not reflect the impact of dilution on earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. The amounts above other than variances related to income taxes have been presented net of income taxes using Ameren’s 2024 blended federal and state statutory tax rate of 26%. For additional details regarding the Ameren Companies’ results of operations, including explanations of Operating Revenues for both Electric Revenues and Natural Gas Revenues; Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses; Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses; Depreciation and Amortization Expenses; Taxes Other Than Income Taxes; Other Income, Net; Interest Charges; and Income Taxes, see the major headings below.\nBelow is Ameren’s table of income statement components by segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\nAmeren Missouri and Ameren Illinois each have issued preferred stock, which provide for cumulative dividends. Each company’s board of directors considers the declaration of preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which the dividend is payable and the amount to be paid.
