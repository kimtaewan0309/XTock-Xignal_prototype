Positive or negative fluctuations in these dependencies could have a corresponding impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company maintains global operations. The United States has announced tariffs and reciprocal tariffs on a wide range of products manufactured or produced worldwide, including Canada, China, the European Union, Japan and Mexico, among others. Several countries have similarly announced reciprocal or other tariffs impacting products manufactured or produced in the United States. In addition, the United States and other nations have, and may in the future, pause, reimpose, decrease or increase tariffs. Although the Company has been largely able to mitigate the impact of tariffs that have been enacted to date, if additional tariffs and reciprocal tariffs are implemented (whether as currently proposed or otherwise), such actions could negatively impact the Company's revenue growth and margins in future periods through decreased sales and increased cost of goods sold. Further, the Company has experienced, and could again experience, increased material cost inflation and component shortages, as well as disruptions and delays in its supply chain, as a result of global macroeconomic trends including the imposition of tariffs and other restrictive trade measures, as well as geopolitical and economic tensions. The net effect of these events will continue to depend on the Company’s ability to successfully mitigate and offset their impact.\nThe Company is taking actions to mitigate the actual and anticipated impact of these events, including strengthening the Company's in region, for region manufacturing strategy, pivoting to local sourcing in its supply chain, accelerating pricing actions and asserting contractual rights through change orders. The Company has historically taken a variety of actions to mitigate trade restrictions, supply chain disruptions and inflation, including through expanding and redistributing its supplier network, supplier financing, accelerated purchasing and productivity improvements. These actions have largely been successful mitigating the impacts of the current macroeconomic environment, however, it is uncertain as to whether the actions taken or contemplated to be taken by the Company will be effective in continuing to mitigate the impact of current and future trade restrictions and their related impacts. The Company continues to actively monitor and evaluate the development and potential impacts of tariffs and other trade restrictions on its supply chain and results of operations.\nAs a result of the Company’s global presence, a significant portion of its revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which results in non-U.S. currency risks and exchange exposure. While the Company employs financial instruments to hedge some of its transactional foreign exchange exposure, these activities do not insulate it completely from those exposures. In addition, currency exposure from the translation of non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries\ncannot be hedged. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could increase or reduce the Company’s profit margin, respectively, and impact the comparability of results from period to period\nThe Company continues to observe trends demonstrating increased interest and demand for its products and services that enable smart, safe, efficient and sustainable buildings, which are driven in part by government tax incentives, building performance standards and other regulations designed to limit emissions and combat climate change. In particular, legislative and regulatory initiatives such as the EU Energy Efficiency Directive, U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive include provisions designed to fund and encourage investment in decarbonization and digital technologies for buildings. This demand is supplemented by an increase in commitments in both the public and private sectors to reduce emissions and/or achieve net zero emissions. The Company seeks to capitalize on these trends to enable delivery of sustainable, high-efficiency products and tailored services to enable customers to achieve their sustainability goals. The Company is leveraging its install base, together with data-driven products and services, to offer outcome-based solutions to customers with a focus on generating accelerated growth in services and recurring revenue.\nCertain of our customers, including governmental and institutional customers, have exhibited increased uncertainty regarding future spending decisions due to various political and economic factors, including budget reductions, reprioritization of spending, interest rate fluctuation and economic uncertainty. This uncertainty has and may in the future impact the Company's ability to predict and forecast the revenue and backlog associated with these customers.\nPortfolio Simplification Transactions\nThe Company continues to engage in an ongoing evaluation of its non-core product lines in connection with its objective to be a pure-play provider of comprehensive solutions for commercial buildings. On July 31, 2025, the Company completed the divestiture of its Residential and Light Commercial (\"R&LC\") HVAC business to Robert Bosch GmbH (“Bosch”) for net cash proceeds of approximately $5.0 billion after tax and transaction-related expenses. The R&LC HVAC business included the Company's North America Ducted business and Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning Holding (UK) Ltd., the Company’s global residential joint venture with Hitachi Global Life Solutions, Inc.\nRestructuring and Cost Optimization Initiatives\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company committed to a multi-year restructuring plan to address stranded costs and further right-size its global operations as a result of previously announced portfolio simplification actions. It is expected that one-time restructuring costs, including severance and other employee termination benefits, contract termination costs, and certain other related cash and non-cash charges, of approximately $400 million will be incurred over the course of fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027, resulting in expected annual cost savings of approximately $500 million upon full completion of the plan. Restructuring and transformation costs in fiscal 2025 have been material, with the resulting savings being realized in fiscal 2026 and 2027. Restructuring costs will be incurred across all segments and Corporate functions.\nCybersecurity Incident\nDuring the weekend of September 23, 2023, the Company experienced a cybersecurity incident impacting its internal information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure and applications.\nThe Company determined that certain data, primarily employee, job applicant and personal information and other related data, was impacted by the incident.\n\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nNine Months Ended June 30,\nEMEA\nAPAC\nThe decrease in Americas was primarily due to the impact of divestitures, unfavorable mix and the impact of prior year earn-out adjustments, partially offset by higher margin backlog conversion and productivity improvements.\nThe increase in EMEA was primarily driven by productivity improvements and positive mix from the growth in Services.\nThe increase in APAC was primarily driven by productivity improvements.\nThe increase in Americas was primarily due to higher margin backlog conversion and productivity improvements, partially offset by the impact of divestitures, prior year earn-out adjustments and ongoing growth investments.\nThe increase in EMEA was primarily driven by productivity improvements and positive mix from the growth in Services.\nThe increase in APAC was primarily driven by productivity improvements.\nBacklog and orders are additional metrics that are meant to provide management with a deeper level of insight into the progress of specific strategic and growth initiatives. Backlog is applicable to sales of products and systems and services and totaled $16.2 billion at June 30, 2025. Orders provide management with a signal of customer demand for the Company's products and services, as well as an indication of future revenues and performance. However, the timing and conversion of backlog and orders are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks and are not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year.\nThe following table summarizes backlog and orders by segment for the Systems and Services based businesses\n\nITEM 2.
