MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-looking Statements\nWe believe we are a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered proprietary aerospace components with significant aftermarket content. We seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers. We attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering, service and manufacturing capabilities. We believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality, reliability and strong customer support. We believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance we believe that due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. More specifically, focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure via productivity and cost improvements and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long-term.\nOur business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers. Our major product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electromechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, batteries and chargers, engineered latching and locking devices, engineered rods, engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions, databus and power controls, cockpit security components and systems, specialized and advanced cockpit displays, engineered audio, radio and antenna systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components, advanced sensor products, switches and relay panels, thermal protection and insulation, lighting and control technology, parachutes, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, cargo loading, handling and delivery systems, specialized flight, wind tunnel and jet engine testing services and equipment, electronic components used in the generation, amplification, transmission and reception of microwave signals and equipment and complex testing and instrumentation solutions. Each of our product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we generated net sales of $2,237 million and net income attributable to TD Group of $492 million. EBITDA As Defined was $1,217 million, or 54.4% of net sales. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for certain information regarding EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, including reconciliations of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined to net income and net cash provided by operating activities.\nFor the thirty-nine week period ended June 28, 2025, demand for air travel remained strong both domestically and internationally though recent RPK statistics indicate a softening in the growth rate, particularly in North America and in domestic passenger markets. Commercial aftermarket sales increased for the thirty-nine week period ended June 28, 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to the overall strong demand for air travel resulting in higher flight hours and utilization of passenger and freight aircraft as global air traffic continues to surpass pre-pandemic levels. We continue to closely monitor the economic environment, including its impact on airline capacity. At this time, we are seeing minimal impact on our commercial aftermarket.\nOur commercial transport original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) shipments and revenues generally run ahead of aircraft delivery schedules. Consistent with prior years, our fiscal 2025 shipments are a function of, among other things, the estimated 2025 and 2026 commercial aircraft production rates for Boeing and Airbus. Airline demand for new aircraft remains high and the OEMs are working to increase aircraft production. However, aircraft production rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels as the struggles in the OEM supply chain and labor challenges persist. Additional factors such as the recent tariff actions and potentially weakening economic environment, and the Boeing machinist strike, which affected its 737 MAX, 767 and 777 production lines, make it difficult to accurately predict the OEM build rates for the balance of fiscal 2025, though progress continues to be made in the build rates. Airbus has also encountered difficulties in ramping up production. For the thirty-nine week period ended June 28, 2025, the impact across TransDigm's operating units has been uneven and varied, resulting in consolidated commercial OEM sales decreasing compared to fiscal 2024.\nOur defense business fluctuates from year-to-year, and is dependent, to a degree, on government budget constraints, the timing of orders, macro and micro dynamics with respect to the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) procurement policy and the extent of global conflicts, such as the ongoing geopolitical conflicts. Likewise, delays in government spending outlays and government funding reprioritization can impact demand. For a variety of reasons, the military spending outlook is very uncertain, though recent DOD budgets have trended upwards due to recent geopolitical challenge and conflicts, and current military modernization efforts. Defense sales for the thirty-nine week period ended June 28, 2025 increased compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to continued improving United States Government (“U.S. Government”) defense spend outlays.\nAt various points in 2025, the U.S. Government has announced new or higher tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. from numerous countries resulting in multiple countries countering with reciprocal tariffs and other actions in response. Negotiations between the U.S. and other countries regarding the tariffs are ongoing and their status continues to evolve. TransDigm is primarily a domestic manufacturer as the majority of its operations are in the U.S. and mainly sources in the U.S. for its U.S.-based production. Because of this and other factors such as the applicability of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, we do not expect the tariffs to have a significant impact on our fiscal 2025 operating results. We continue to monitor the developments on tariffs and other changes in trade policy for its potential impact on the economic environment and on our business and operating results.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated unaudited interim financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report are the responsibility of management. The financial statements and footnotes have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial statements and contain certain amounts that were based upon management’s best estimates, judgments and assumptions that were believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare financial statements. Estimates are based on historical experience, judgments and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management.\nRecent acquisitions are described in Note 2, “Acquisitions,” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data of the Company, including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales (amounts in millions, except per share data):\nThirteen Week Periods Ended\nSelling and administrative expenses\nAmortization of intangible assets\nIncome from operations\nInterest expense-net\nIncome tax provision\nIncome from continuing operations\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\nNet income attributable to TD Group\nNet income applicable to TD Group common stockholders\nEarnings per share attributable to TD Group common stockholders:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding—basic and diluted\nEBITDA\n\nJune 29, 2024 were as follows (amounts in millions):\nThirteen Week Periods Ended\nOrganic sales represent net sales from existing businesses owned by the Company, excluding sales from acquisitions. Acquisition sales represent net sales from acquired businesses for the period up to one year from the respective acquisition date. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions,” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for information on the Company's recent acquisitions.\nThe increase in organic sales of $129 million for the thirteen week period ended June 28, 2025 compared to the thirteen week period ended June 29, 2024 is primarily related to increases in defense sales ($122 million, an increase of 15.4%) and commercial aftermarket sales ($35 million, an increase of 5.7%), partially offset by a decrease in commercial OEM sales ($33 million, a decrease of 7.0%). The increase in defense sales is primarily attributable to continued improving U.S. Government defense spend outlays. The increase in commercial aftermarket sales is primarily attributable to the strong demand for air travel resulting in higher flight hours and utili"
