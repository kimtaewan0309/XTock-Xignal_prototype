  "item2_clean": "Impact of Global Macroeconomic Conditions on Our Company\nGlobal macroeconomic conditions have impacted, and continue to impact, aspects of the Company's operations and overall financial performance during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. These macroeconomic conditions include, among others, inflationary pressures, high interest rates, tighter credit conditions,\nthe U.S. federal government shutdown a\nnd changes in global\ntrade policies including higher tariffs in the U.S. and other countries. These macroeconomic trends could co\nntinue to impact our business, including impacts to overall financial performance during the remainder of 2025, as a result of the following, among other things:\nHigher costs of products and services due to tariffs;\nCustomer demand impacting our new equipment, maintenance and repair, and modernization businesses;\nCustomer liquidity constraints and related credit reserve;\nCancellations or delays of customer orders; and\nSupplier liquidity, as well as supplier and raw material capacity constraints, delays and related costs.\nOther than the estimated potential impact from new tariffs currently in effect of approximately $25 million to $35 million during 2025, we currently do not expect\nany significant impact to our capital and financial resources from these macroeconomic conditions, including to our overall liquidity position based on our available cash and cash equivalents and our access to credit facilities and the capital markets.\n\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\nOperating activities\nCash flows from operating activities primarily represent inflows and outflows associated with our operations. Primary activities include net income from operations adjusted for non-cash transactions, working capital changes and changes in other assets and liabilities.\nThe year-over-year decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by working capital balances during the periods, including a larger increase in Accounts receivable, net, in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, due to timing of billings and collections and a larger decrease in Accounts payable in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, due to timing of payments to suppliers, partially offset by the decrease in Other current assets due to the refunds received in 2025 from the German tax litigation. Additionally, Separation-related and UpLift-related net payments were approximately $92 million and $77 million, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to approximately $49 million and $54 million, respectively, in the same period in 2024.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was $779 million. Net income of $1.1 billion includes $62 million of indemnification expense resulting from the German tax litigation and $10 million of impairment loss related to net assets held for sale, none of which resulted in cash flow activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Net income and the decrease in Other current assets due to refunds received in 2025 from the German tax litigation were also partially offset by a decrease in Accounts payable due to timing of payments to suppliers and an increase in Accounts receivable, net, due to timing of billings and collections. For additional discussion of the German tax litigation, see Note 1 and Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $873 million. Net income of $1.4 billion includes $185 million of income tax benefits, $200 million of interest income and $194 million of indemnification expense resulting from the outcome of the German tax litigation during the third quarter of 2024, none of which resulted in cash flow activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net income was also partially offset by a decrease in Accounts payable due to the timing of payments to suppliers, an increase in Accounts receivable, net, due to the timing of billings and collections, a decrease in Accrued liabilities and an increase in Other current assets due to the timing of payments, including employee-related benefits, income taxes and supplier payments.\nInvesting activities\nCash flows from investing activities primarily represent inflows and outflows associated with long-term assets, including capital expenditures, investments in businesses and securities, proceeds from the sale of fixed assets and the settlement of derivative contracts.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net cash used in investing activities was $376 million. The primary drivers of the outflow related to $211 million of net cash payments from the settlement of derivative instruments, $107 million of capital expenditures and $92 million of acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets. These were partially offset by $35 million of net proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $210 million. The primary drivers of the outflow related to $87 million of capital expenditures, $70 million of acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets and $47 million of net cash payments from the settlement of derivative instruments.\nAs discussed in Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes. We operate internationally and, in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We use derivative instruments, including forward contracts and options to manage certain foreign currency and commodity price exposures.\nFinancing activities\nCash flows from financing activities primarily represent inflows and outflows associated with equity and borrowings. Primary activities include short-term and long-term borrowing activity, paying dividends to shareholders, the repurchase of our Common Stock and dividends or other payments to noncontrolling interests.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 billion. The primary drivers of the outflow were repayments of long-term debt of $1.3 billion, repurchases of our Common Stock of $809 million and dividends paid on our Common Stock of $483 million. These were partially offset by the proceeds from the long-term debt issuance of $500 million and short-term borrowings of $280 million.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion. The primary drivers of the outflow were repurchases of our Common Stock of $800 million, dividends paid on our Common Stock and to noncontrolling shareholders of $450 million and $81 million, respectively, and acquisitions of noncontrolling interest shares of $75 million, including approximately $70 million for our subsidiary in Japan. These were partially offset by short-term borrowings of $325 million.\nGuaranteed Securities: Summarized Financial Information\nThe following information is provided in compliance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the 2026 Euro Notes, the 2027 Euro Notes and the 2031 Euro Notes (together the \"Euro Notes\"), in each case issued by Highland Holdings S.à r.l.
