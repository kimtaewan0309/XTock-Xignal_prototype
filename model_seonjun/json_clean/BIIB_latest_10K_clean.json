The EC has asked the CHMP to consider information on the safety of lecanemab that became available after the adoption of the CHMP opinion in November 2024 and whether this may require an update of the opinion, and to consider whether the wording of the risk minimization measures in the opinion is clear enough to ensure correct implementation. These will be discussed at the CHMP meeting in February 2025.\nIn December 2024 LEQEMBI was approved by the Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risk in Mexico.\nIn November 2024 we and Eisai announced the launch of LEQEMBI in South Korea, which had been approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea in May 2024.\nIn October 2024 the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia issued a public statement about the initial decision not to register lecanemab. In December 2024 Eisai submitted a request for reconsideration of this decision.\nIn August 2024 LEQEMBI was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in Great Britain and by the Ministry of Health and Prevention in the United Arab Emirates.\nIn July 2024 LEQEMBI was approved in Hong Kong and Israel.\nIn June 2024 we and Eisai announced the launch of LEQEMBI in China, which had been approved by the NMPA in China in January 2024.\nUCB COLLABORATION\nIn September 2024 we and UCB announced positive topline data from the Phase 3 PHOENYCS GO study of dapirolizumab pegol, a novel Fc-free anti-CD40L drug candidate, in people living with moderate-to-severe SLE. The Phase 3 study met the primary endpoint demonstrating clinical improvement in moderate-to-severe SLE with clinical improvements observed among key secondary endpoints. Based on these results, UCB and Biogen initiated a second Phase 3 study in late 2024.\nMANAGEMENT CHANGES\nIn October 2024 we announced that Michael R. McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, plans to retire from Biogen on March 1, 2025. Upon Mr. McDonnell's retirement, Robin C. Kramer, currently Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer at Biogen, will assume the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nIn January 2025 we announced the appointment of Sean Godbout as Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Global Corporate Controller, effective March 1, 2025, upon the transition of Robin C. Kramer, currently Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer at Biogen, to the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS UPDATE\nEffective October 1, 2024, Lloyd B. Minor, M.D. joined our Board of Directors.\nEffective January 1, 2025, Sir Menelas (Mene) Pangalos, Ph.D. joined our Board of Directors.\nFor additional information on our executive officers, please read the subsection entitled \"Information about our Executive Officers\" included in this report.\nPRODUCT AND PIPELINE DEVELOPMENTS\nNEUROLOGY\nALZHEIMER'S DISEASE\nIn October 2024 Eisai presented data on benefits of long-term administration of dual-acting LEQEMBI at the 2024 CTAD conference. The data presented additional measures resulting from the three years of continuous LEQEMBI treatment, showing that 46% of patients improved or had no decline and 33% showed improvement from baseline on the CDR-SB. On the ADAS-Cog14 measurement scale, 46% of patients showed improvement or no decline and 43% showed improvement. On the ADCS MCI-ADL measurement scale, 51% of patients showed improvement or no decline and 48% showed improvement.\nIn July 2024 Eisai announced the results of a detailed analysis of the Phase 3 CLARITY Alzheimer's disease study of LEQEMBI at the 2024 AAIC conference. The study provided further Phase 3 analysis showing three years of continuous LEQEMBI treatment reduced clinical decline by -0.95 on CDR-SB showing continued clinically and personally meaningful benefit for early Alzheimer's disease patients.\nIMMUNOLOGY\nFelzartamab was granted ODD in the E.U. in IgAN and solid organ transplantation in November 2024 and December 2024, respectively.\nIn October 2024 we presented complete results from the Phase 2 IGNAZ study evaluating felzartamab, an investigational anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, in people living with IgAN during the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2024. The results from the study showed substantial reductions in proteinuria, stabilization of kidney function and sustained treatment effect more than 18 months after the last dose of felzartamab.\nIn October 2024 the FDA granted felzartamab Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of late AMR without T-cell mediated rejection in kidney transplant patients.\nRARE DISEASE\nSPINRAZA (nusinersen)\nIn January 2025 the FDA accepted the supplemental NDA and the EMA validated the application for a higher dose regimen of nusinersen for SMA. The higher dose regimen of nusinersen comprises a more rapid loading regimen, two 50 mg-doses 14 days apart, and higher maintenance regimen, 28 mg, every four months, compared to the currently approved dose of SPINRAZA.\nIn September 2024 we announced positive topline data from the Phase 2/3 DEVOTE study of nusinersen, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of a higher dose regimen of nusinersen in treatment-naive symptomatic infants with SMA.\nIn March 2024 we announced new data from the Phase 4 RESPOND study for SPINRAZA. The study showed that neurofilament levels, an indicator of neurodegeneration, were reduced in nearly all study participants treated with SPINRAZA. The reductions in biomarker complement previously reported RESPOND study efficacy results showing improved motor function in most participants treated with SPINRAZA after gene therapy.\nSKYCLARYS\nIn September 2024 SKYCLARYS was approved by SWISSMEDIC for the treatment of FA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older.\nIn July 2024 the first pediatric patient was treated in the Phase 1 study of SKYCLARYS designed to identify the appropriate dose for the pediatric population living with FA.\nQALSODY\nIn December 2024 the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved QALSODY in Japan.\nIn October 2024 QALSODY was approved in China by the NMPA under the conditional approval pathway for the treatment of adults with ALS associated with a mutation in the SOD1 gene.\nIn May 2024 the EC approved QALSODY in the E.U. for the treatment of adults with ALS associated with a mutation in the SOD1 gene. QALSODY is the first treatment approved in the E.U. to target a genetic cause of ALS.\nDISCONTINUED PROGRAMS AND STUDIES\nSAGE COLLABORATION\nIn October 2024 we and Sage agreed to not pursue further development of zuranolone for the potential treatment of MDD. This decision was based on the significant new investment and time we expect would be needed to conduct the additional studies required to support approval of this indication.\nBIIB124\nIn July 2024 we and Sage announced that the Phase 2 KINETIC 2 dose-range study of BIIB124 did not meet its endpoints. Based on these results, we discontinued our further development of BIIB124 and terminated our rights under the collaboration and license agreement specific to BIIB124, effective February 17, 2025.\nSAMSUNG BIOEPIS 2019 DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION AGREEMENT\nIn October 2024 we notified Samsung Bioepis of our decision to terminate our 2019 Development and Commercialization Agreement (the DCA Agreement) solely within the U.S. and Canada. Biogen will transfer commercialization rights for BYOOVIZ and OPUVIZ in the U.S. and Canada back to Samsung Bioepis over a period of up to 18 months. During this transition period, we will continue to commercialize BYOOVIZ. The termination does not impact the other markets in the DCA Agreement.\nIONIS COLLABORATION\nBIIB105\nIn May 2024 we and Ionis announced that the Phase 1/2 ALSpire study of BIIB105, an investigational ASO for the potential treatment of ALS, did not meet its endpoints. Based on these results, we discontinued our further development of BIIB105.\nBIIB121\nIn May 2024 we announced that we have elected not to exercise our option to license and lead development of BIIB121, an ASO for the potential treatment of Angelman syndrome.\nMERZ THERAPEUTICS (PREVIOUSLY ACORDA THERAPEUTICS, INC.)\nIn January 2024 we notified Acorda of our decision to terminate our collaboration and license agreement, effective January 1, 2025, whereby Acorda regained global commercialization rights to FAMPYRA. On April 1, 2024, Acorda filed for bankruptcy protection and announced its intention to sell substantially all of Acorda's assets to a third party. On July 10, 2024, Merz Therapeutics announced that its subsidiary Merz Pharmaceuticals LLC had completed the acquisition of FAMPYRA, and related assets from Acorda. We are now working with Merz Therapeutics on the transition of global commercialization rights of FAMPYRA and we expect to recognize minimal revenue in 2025.\nBIIB143 (cemdomespib)\nIn early 2025 we discontinued further development of BIIB143 (cemdomespib) for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, as part of our ongoing pipeline prioritization efforts.\nMARKETED PRODUCTS\nThe following graph shows our product revenue, revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs and Alzheimer's collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nMS includes TECFIDERA, VUMERITY, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, TYSABRI and FAMPYRA.\nRare disease includes SPINRAZA, QALSODY, which became commercially available in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2023 and commercially available in the E.U. during the second quarter of 2024, and SKYCLARYS, which was obtained as part of our acquisition of Reata in September 2023.

Patents relating to pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products, compounds and processes, such as those that cover our existing products, compounds and processes and those that we will likely file in the future, do not always provide complete or adequate protection. Litigation, interferences, oppositions,\nreviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We also face challenges to our patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights covering our products by third-parties, such as manufacturers of generics, biosimilars, prodrugs and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights is set forth in\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nincluded in this report, and the discussion of legal proceedings related to certain patents described above is set forth in\nNote 21, Litigation,\nto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCOMPETITION\nCompetition in the biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate is intense. There are many companies, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, engaged in developing products for the indications our approved products are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do.\nWe believe that competition and leadership in the industry is based on scientific, managerial and technological excellence and innovation, as well as establishing patent and other proprietary positions through research and development. The achievement of a leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to maximize the approval, acceptance and use of our product candidates and the availability of adequate financial resources to fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing. Another key aspect of remaining competitive in the industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientists and technicians to conduct our research activities and advance our development programs, including with the regulatory and commercial expertise to effectively advance and market our products.\nCompetition among products approved for sale may be based, among other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, delivery devices, reliability, availability, reimbursement and price. In addition, early entry of a new pharmaceutical product into the market may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and market share. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the testing and approval process and supply commercial quantities of products will have a significant impact on our competitive position.\nThe introduction of new products or technologies, including the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products or technologies, results in increased competition for our marketed products and pricing pressure on our marketed products. The development of new or improved treatment options could eliminate the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. Similarly, developments of new standards of care practices, treatment options or cures for the diseases our products treat could have similar impacts.\nWe believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, along with our ability to manufacture products efficiently and to launch and market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.\nAdditional information about the competition that our marketed products face is set forth below and in\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nincluded in this report.\nGENERIC AND BIOSIMILARS COMPETITION\nCertain of our products already face, or may face in the future, competition from the introduction of generic versions, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Such products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products. Accordingly, the introduction of such products as well as other lower-priced competing products may significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell, which will negatively impact our revenue. In some jurisdictions a decrease in reimbursed price is mandated by law. In addition, in some markets, when a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it may be automatically substituted for our product and significantly reduce our revenue in a short period of time.\nMultiple TECFIDERA generic entrants are now in North America, Brazil and certain European countries and have deeply discounted prices compared to TECFIDERA. We are defending the validity of our EP 2 653 873 patent related to TECFIDERA and expiring in 2028 in opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office. We are also engaged in litigation in Europe to defend and enforce national counterparts of our EP 2 653 873 patent, with mixed results. The generic competition for TECFIDERA has significantly reduced our TECFIDERA revenue and we expect that TECFIDERA revenue will continue to decline.\nB\nosimilar products referencing RITUXAN have launched in the U.S and are being offered at lower prices. This competition has had a significant adverse impact on the pre-tax profits of our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, as the sales of RITUXAN have decreased substantially compared to prior periods. We expect that biosimilar competition will continue to increase as these products capture additional market share and that this will have a significant adverse impact on our co-promotion profits in the U.S. in future years.\nA biosimilar entrant of TYSABRI was approved in the U.S. and the E.U. in 2023. We expect that future sales of TYSABRI may be adversely affected by the entrance of this biosimilar.\nNEUROLOGY\nMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS\nCompetition in the MS market is intense. Along with us, a number of companies are working to develop additional treatments for MS that may in the future compete with our MS products. One competing product that was approved in the U.S. in 2017 and in the E.U. in 2018 is OCREVUS, a treatment for RMS and PPMS that was developed by Genentech. Another competing product that was approved in the U.S. in 2020 and the E.U. in 2021 is KESIMPTA, a treatment for RMS that was developed by Novartis AG. While we have a financial interest in OCREVUS, future sales of our MS products may be adversely affected if OCREVUS and KESIMPTA continue to gain market share, or if other MS products that we or our competitors are developing are commercialized.\nALZHEIMER'S DISEASE\nThe market for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is undeveloped and could be subject to rapid change in the future. Most current treatments are symptomatic or intended to improve quality of life. Along with us, several companies are working to develop additional treatments. We and our collaboration partner Eisai co-commercialize LEQEMBI, an anti-amyloid antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In 2024 a competing product, KISUNLA, a treatment for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease that was developed by Eli Lilly and Company, was approved in the U.S. We are aware of other products now in development that, if approved, may also compete with LEQEMBI.\nRARE DISEASE\nSPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY\nWe face competition from a gene therapy product ZOLGENSMA (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) and an oral product EVRYSDI (risdiplam). We expect that we will experience competition from both products in additional jurisdictions in the future, as well as from the launch of new formulations of those products, which may adversely affect our sales of SPINRAZA.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\nA commitment to research and development is fundamental to our mission. Our research efforts are focused on better understanding the underlying biology of diseases so we can discover and deliver treatments that have the potential to make a real difference in the lives of patients with high unmet medical needs. By applying our expertise in biologics and our capabilities in small molecule, antisense, gene therapy and other technologies, we target specific medical needs where we believe new or better treatments are needed.\nWe intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities where there is a significant unmet need and where a drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated. As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we have devoted significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products and technologies and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels.\nFor additional information on our research and development expense included in our consolidated statements of income, please read\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nincluded in this report.\nThe table below highlights our current research and development programs that are in clinical trials and the current phase of such programs. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug development efforts are discussed in\nItem 1A.
