CECONY’s principal business operations are its regulated electric, gas and steam delivery businesses. O&R’s principal business operations are its regulated electric and gas delivery businesses. Con Edison Transmis\nsion, a regulated company primarily under the oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), develops and invests in electric transmission projects and owns, through joint ventures, both electric and gas assets. Con Edison\nTransmission is considering strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP) and both Con Edison Transmission and CECONY are considering strategic alternatives with respect to their investments in Honeoye Storage Corporation (Honeoye). See\nin Note A to the Third Quarter Financial Statements and\n“Con Edison Transmission” below\nCon Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and electric transmission assets. Con Edison invests to provide reliable, resilient, safe and clean energy critical for its New York and New Jersey customers. Con Edison is a responsible neighbor, helping the communities it serves become more sustainable.\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A and the Companies’ material contingencies described in Notes B, G and H to the Third Quarter Financial Statements, the Companies’ management considers the following events, trends, and uncertainties to be important to understanding the Companies’ current and future financial condition.\nAged Accounts Receivable Balances\nAt September 30, 2025, CECONY’s and O&R’s customer accounts receivables balances of $2,843 million and $121 million, respectively, included aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $1,511 million and $28 million, respectively. At December 31, 2024, CECONY’s and O&R’s customer accounts receivables balances of $2,947 million and $113 million, respectively, included aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $1,652 million and $32 million, respectively. In comparison, CECONY’s and O&R’s customer accounts receivable balances at February 28, 2020 were $1,322 million and $89 million, respectively, including aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $408 million and $15 million, respectively. Prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Utilities’ practice was to write off customer accounts receivables as uncollectible 90 days after the account is disconnected for non-payment or the account is closed during the collection process. In general, the Utilities suspended collection activities and service disconnections during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since resumed such activities.\nCECONY’s 2023 - 2025 electric and gas rate plans include reconciliation of late payment charges (from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025 and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2026 for steam and write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances (from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2025 for electric and gas and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2026 for steam) to amounts reflected in rates, with recovery/refund from or to customers via surcharge/surcredit. CECONY's surcharge recoveries for late payment charges and write-offs of accounts receivable balances will, collectively, be subject to separate annual caps for electric and gas that produce no more than a half percent (0.5 percent) total customer bill impact per commodity (estimated for electric to be $57.3 million, $60.3 million, $62.6 milli\non for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, and for gas to be $14.8 million, $15.9 million and $16.8 million for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively). CECONY's surcharge recoveries for late payment charges and write-offs of accounts receivables for steam will each be subject to an annual cap that produces no more than a half percent (0.5 percent) total customer bill impact (estimated to be $2.5 million, $3.0 million and $3.5 million for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively). Amounts in excess of the surcharge caps will be deferred as a regulatory asset for recovery in CECONY’s next base rate cases. CECONY’s November 2025 joint proposal, that is subject to approval by the NYSPSC, includes reconciliation of late payment charges during the rate plan pursuant to which CECONY will calculate the annual difference between (i) its actual uncollectible expenses and late payment charges and (ii) the levels of uncollectible expenses and late payment charges provided in rates. In the event the actual net expenses (uncollectible expenses plus late payment charges) are below the amounts in rates, CECONY will defer the full variance as a regulatory liability and refund to customers via surcredit. In the event the actual net expenses are above the amounts in rates, CECONY will defer the full annual variance above $10 million ($8.5 million for electric and $1.5 million for gas) in 2026; above $15 million ($12.75 million for electric and $2.25 million for gas) in 2027; and above $20 million ($17.0 million for electric and $3.0 million for gas) in 2028; as a regulatory asset for recovery via surcharge.\nO&R’s 2025 – 2027 rate plans include reconciliation of uncollectible expenses and late payment charges that are subject to a combined annual threshold of $0.9 million and $0.5 million for electric and gas, respectively. Once the threshold is met, O&R will defer the variance between actual uncollectible expense and late payment charge, and the level set forth in rates that is above the threshold. Recovery/refunds will be made via surcharge/surcredit. Surcharge recovery is subject to an annual cap that produces no more than a 0.5 percent total customer bill impact\nper commodity. Amounts in excess of the surcharge caps will be deferred as a regulatory asset for recovery in O&R’s next base rate cases.\nAlthough these regulatory mechanisms are currently in place, the Utilities’ ability to effectively manage their customer accounts receivable balances, and obtain recovery in rates for their respective carrying costs and any related write-offs could have a material impact on the Companies’ businesses. In addition, a continued increase in accounts receivable balances has impacted and is expected to continue to impac\nt the Companies’ liquidity. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” below, and Note B and Note L to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.\nIn particular, CECONY, in an effort to reduce aged accounts receivables balances, plans to continue to execute on its integrated collections strategy, which includes, among other things, implementation of payment arrangements, enhanced digital and mail communications to customers regarding collections, increased field collections by recently having hired additional field collectors and increasing collector efficiency and employing additional call center representatives to handle in-bound call volumes a\nnd to place outbound calls to customers regarding collections. O&R's collection strategy aligns with that of CEC\nONY's in many respects.\nMost of the electricity sold by CECONY to its full-service customers in 2025 was purchased through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. To reduce the volatility of its full-service customers’ electric energy costs, the company enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its expected purchases through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market.\nThe NYISO is interconnected with two Canadian system operators, Ontario’s Independent Electricity System Operator and Hydro-Québec, allowing for up to approximately 2500 MW and 2100 MW of imports from Ontario to New York and from Quebec to New York, respectively.\nBeginning in February 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on most Canadian imports to the United States of “energy or energy resources.” This executive order took effect on March 4, 2025 with an exemption for goods compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The federal government has not provided guidance regarding the applicability of tariffs to imported Canadian electricity and, as of September 30, 2025, no tariffs are being applied to electricity sales. In March 2025, Ontario announced a 25 percent surcharge on all U.S.-bound electricity that was subsequently paused. See \"Federal Regulation,\" below.\nThese tariffs, if implemented, may result in increases in electric commodity prices. The Utilities do not make any margin or profit on the electricity they sell and generally recover these costs pursuant to their rate plans. See \"Aged Accounts Receivable Balances,\" above and \"Commodity Price Risk,\" below.\nThe Companies continue to monitor these developments closely to assess any potential impact on the Companies. The Companies are unable to predict changes in regulations, regulatory guidance, legal interpretations, policy positions and implementation actions that may result from these governmental actions.\nBeginning in January 2025, a series of executive orders, presidential memoranda and proclamations were issued (collectively, Presidential Actions) designed to address areas such as tariffs, environm\nental and energy regulations, domestic energy production and retention of domestic generation resources, among other things. The situation remains fluid and is subject to rapid change.\nIn April 2025, an executive order was issued by the President of the United States that directs the Attorney General to identify and take action against state laws and policies that burden the use of domestic energy resources and that are unconstitutional, preempted by federal law, or otherwise unenforceable (the April 2025 Executive Order). The\nApril 2025 Executive Order directs the"
