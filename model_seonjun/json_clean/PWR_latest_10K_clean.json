(together with its subsidiaries, “Quanta,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading provider of comprehensive infrastructure solutions for the electric and gas utility, renewable energy, technology, communications, pipeline and energy industries in the United States, Canada, Australia and select other international markets. We provide engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade and repair and maintenance services for infrastructure within each of these industries, including electric power transmission and distribution networks; substation facilities; wind and solar generation and transmission and battery storage facilities; electrical systems for data center, commercial and industrial facilities; communications and cable multi-system operator networks; gas utility systems; pipeline transmission systems and facilities; and downstream industrial facilities. Our operations are decentralized and labor-intensive, and we rely on craft skilled labor personnel and experienced operators to successfully manage our day-to-day business. We also have an experienced management team, both at the executive and regional levels and within our subsidiaries, which we refer to as operating companies. We operate a fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction equipment, as well as various proprietary technologies that enhance our service offerings. We have a large and diverse customer base, including many of the leading companies in the utility, renewable energy, technology, communications, industrial and energy delivery markets.\nThe performance of our business generally depends on our ability to obtain contracts with customers and to effectively deliver the services provided under those contracts. Our services are typically provided pursuant to master service agreements (MSAs), repair and maintenance contracts and fixed price and non-fixed price construction and engineering contracts. We offer comprehensive and diverse solutions on a broad geographic scale and have a solid base of long-standing customer relationships in each of the industries we serve. We believe our reputation for safety leadership, responsiveness and performance, geographic reach, comprehensive service offerings and financial strength have resulted in strong relationships with numerous customers, and we endeavor to develop and maintain strategic alliances and preferred service provider status with our customers.\nWe believe that our business strategies, along with our safety culture and financial resources, differentiate us from our competition and position us to benefit from future programmatic and capital spending by our customers. Our strategies include delivering and continuing to expand our portfolio of infrastructure solutions to existing and potential customers, developing our technological and training capabilities, remaining committed to the safety of our employees, and maintaining an entrepreneurial culture throughout our organization. We believe executing on these strategies places us in the position to capitalize on opportunities and trends in the industries we serve and expand our operations to select new markets.\nSEGMENTS\nWe report our results under three reportable segments: Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions (Electric Power), Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions (Renewable Energy) and Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions (Underground and Infrastructure). Our entrepreneurial business model allows multiple operating companies to serve the same or similar customers and to provide a range of services across end user markets. Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating income by type of work, is gathered from each operating company. Classification of operating company revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can require judgment on the part of management. Beginning in the three months ending March 31, 2025, our Chief Executive Officer reevaluated how he assesses performance and allocates resources, which resulted in a change in the reporting of management’s internal financial information. As a result, we will begin reporting the results of our two operating segments, which will also be our two reportable segments: (1) Electric Infrastructure Solutions and (2) Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions. The Electric Infrastructure Solutions segment will consist of the historical Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments.\nWe operate primarily in the United States; however, we derived approximately 8.7%, 14.2% and 15.7% of our revenues from foreign operations, primarily in Canada and Australia, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nOur Electric Power segment provides comprehensive services primarily for the electric power and also for the communications markets. We believe our collaborative, customer-focused, and solutions-based approach, combined with our significant capabilities and scale, differentiate us in the marketplace. Services performed generally include:\ndesign, procurement, new construction, upgrade and repair and maintenance services for electric power transmission and distribution infrastructure, both overhead and underground, and substation facilities, along with other\nengineering and technical services, including services that support the implementation of upgrades by utilities to modernize and harden the electric power grid in order to ensure its safety and enhance reliability and to accommodate increased residential and commercial use of electric vehicles (EVs);\nemergency restoration services, including the repair of infrastructure damaged by fires and inclement weather;\nenergized installation, maintenance and upgrade of electric power infrastructure utilizing our bare hand and hot stick methods and our robotic arm techniques;\ninstallation of “smart grid” technologies on electric power networks;\ndesign and installation of electrical systems for data center, commercial and industrial facilities;\ndesign and construction services to wireline and wireless communications companies, cable multi-system operators and other customers within the communications industry (including services in connection with 5G wireless deployment);\ndesign, installation, maintenance and repair services related to commercial and industrial wiring; and\naviation services primarily for the utility industry, including transportation of line workers, pole and tower setting, and wire stringing, as well as certain emergency aerial firefighting services.\nThis segment also includes (i) the majority of the financial results of our advanced training facility and our postsecondary educational institution, which specializes in pre-apprenticeship training, apprenticeship training and specialized utility task training for electric workers, as well as training for the gas distribution and communications industries; (ii) our portion of earnings of our unconsolidated integral affiliates, which includes, among others, our 50% equity interest in LUMA Energy, LLC (LUMA), a joint venture that was selected to operate, maintain, and modernize the approximately 18,000-mile electric transmission and distribution system in Puerto Rico; and (iii) financial results associated with our power transformer and circuit breaker manufacturing operations.\nBusiness Environment\nWith respect to our electric power service offerings, utilities are continuing to invest significant capital in their gas- powered and renewable generation systems, as well as their electric power delivery systems, particularly transmission, substation and distribution infrastructure, through multi-year, multi-billion dollar grid modernization and reliability programs. We also expect demand for electricity in North America to continue to grow, including through electrification trends (e.g., EV adoption) and increased demand for data center infrastructure and manufacturing facilities, and believe that certain segments of the North American electric power grid are not adequate to efficiently supply this future demand. To accommodate this growth, we expect continued demand for new or expanded transmission, substation and distribution infrastructure to reliably transport power to meet demand driven by electrification, data centers and manufacturing reshoring, and the modification and reengineering of existing infrastructure with increasing penetration of renewable generation and battery storage. In order to reliably and efficiently deliver power and in preparation for emerging technologies, such as EVs, utilities are also integrating smart grid technologies into distribution systems to improve grid management and create efficiencies. A number of utilities also continue to implement system upgrades and hardening programs in response to recurring severe weather events. For example, utilities throughout the United States are executing storm hardening programs to make their systems more resilient to hurricanes and other severe weather events, and there are significant system resiliency initiatives underway in California and other regions in the United States that are designed to prevent and manage the impact of wildfires. Utilities are also executing significant initiatives to underground critical infrastructure, including additional underground transmission and distribution initiatives by utilities in California, underground transmission projects in the northeast United States and underground distribution circuits along the U.S. coastlines.\nAdditionally, the technology industry is investing significant capital in the build out of data centers in order to expand cloud-based services and develop artificial intelligence (AI) training and inference. As mentioned above, these facilities consume significant electricity and are a meaningful driver of increasing load demand throughout our service geographies. Given this significant demand and resulting impact on the electric power grid, we believe we are well positioned to provide turnkey infrastructure solutions, such as critical path low-voltage electrical infrastructure solutions inside data centers, including advanced manufactured, modular solutions, as well as the high-voltage substation, transformers and transmission interconnection infrastructure connecting the facility to the power grid.\nWith respect to our communications service offerings, which are focused on the North American market, consumer and commercial demand for communication and data-intensive, high-bandwidth wireline and wireless services and applications are driving significant investment in infrastructure and the deployment of new technologies. In particular, we believe there are opportunities to provide fiber and other services in and around data centers, and to interconnect data centers. Communications providers are utilizing fifth generation wireless (5G) infrastructure to support fixed wireless access, which is driving additional\nfiber capacity requirements for consumer and commercial applications. Additionally, legislative and regulatory initiatives, including the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), have dedicated billions of dollars of funding to support broadband service to underserved markets.\nOur Renewable Energy segment provides comprehensive infrastructure solutions to customers that are involved in the renewable energy industry. Like our Electric Power operations, as an industry leader in the renewable energy space, we believe our collaborative, customer-focused, solutions based approach coupled with our significant capabilities and scale differentiates us in the marketplace. Services performed generally include:\nengineering, procurement, new construction, repowering and repair and maintenance services for renewable generation facilities, such as utility-scale wind, solar and hydropower generation facilities and battery storage faciliti",

(together with its subsidiaries, Quanta, we, us or our) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nin Part II of this Annual Report. The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including those identified in\nCautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements and Information\nabove and in Item 1A.\nin Part I of this Annual Report.\nThe discussion summarizing the significant factors which affected the results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the changes in results of operations between the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, can be found in Part II, Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur 2024 results reflect increased demand for our services, as consolidated revenues and operating income increased as compared to 2023, primarily due to increased revenues and operating income for our Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions (Renewable Energy) and Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions (Electric Power) segments.\nWith respect to our Electric Power segment, utilities are continuing to invest significant capital in their electric power delivery systems through multi-year grid modernization and reliability programs, as well as system upgrades and hardening programs in response to recurring severe weather events. We have also experienced high demand for new and expanded transmission, substation and distribution infrastructure needed to reliably transport power. In particular, we continue to experience strong demand from our utility customers, which we believe is driven by increasing demand for electricity associated with, among other things, data centers and other technology-related dynamics, domestic manufacturing reshoring initiatives and overall electrification trends. Our acquisition of Cupertino Electric, Inc. (CEI) during 2024 also resulted in increased services for our critical path electrical design and installation solutions from the technology and data center industry.\nWith respect to our Renewable Energy segment, the cost-effectiveness of solar, wind energy and battery storage, combined with a meaningful increase in current and forecasted electricity demand, is continuing to drive demand for renewable generation and related infrastructure (e.g., high-voltage electric transmission, substation infrastructure and battery storage), as well as interconnection services necessary to connect and transmit renewable-generated electricity to existing electric power delivery systems. Despite these positive longer-term trends, in prior periods supply chain challenges, policy and regulatory uncertainty and other factors have resulted in project delays. For example, shortages of, and increased costs for, materials necessary for certain projects, particularly sourcing restrictions related to solar panels necessary for the utility-scale solar industry and delays in availability of power transformers impacting the electric power and renewable energy industries impacted certain prior periods.\nWith respect to our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions (Underground and Infrastructure) segment, during 2024, operating income margin was negatively impacted by cost absorption pressures across our gas operations in the United States due to reduced demand and project delays for our industrial operations along the U.S. Gulf Coast due to Hurricanes Beryl and Francine. We continue to believe the market for our industrial solutions and gas utility and pipeline integrity services remains solid given the recurring critical-path maintenance requirements and regulated spend dedicated to modernizing systems, reducing methane emissions, ensuring environmental compliance and improving safety and reliability. However, revenues associated with large pipeline projects decreased in 2024 as compared to 2023 and 2022, and we anticipate that revenues associated with these projects will continue to fluctuate.\nDuring 2024, increased revenues and operating income contributed to $2.08 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, a 32.1% increase compared to 2023, which allowed us to execute our business plan, including the strategic acquisition of certain businesses, for which we utilized $1.75 billion of cash, net of cash acquired, and the payment of $54.2 million in dividends associated with our common stock. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, available commitments under our senior credit facility, combined with our cash and cash equivalents, totaled $3.35 billion.\nAdditionally, we entered into certain debt financing arrangements in connection with our acquisition of CEI, and on October 1, 2024, we repaid the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.95% senior notes, which were issued in 2021. These debt financing arrangements are more fully described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nin Part II of this Annual Report.\nWe expect the strong demand for our services will continue. Our remaining performance obligations and backlog were $16.76 billion and $34.54 billion as of December 31, 2024, representing increases of 20.6%, and 14.7% relative to December 31, 2023. For a reconciliation of backlog to remaining performance obligations, the most comparable financial measure prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), see\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFor additional information regarding our overall business environment, see\nof this Annual Report.\nSignificant Factors Impacting Results\nOur revenues, profit, margins and other results of operations can be influenced by a variety of factors in any given period, including those described in Item 1.\nof Part I of this Annual Report, and those factors have caused fluctuations in our results in the past and are expected to cause fluctuations in our results in the future. Additional information with respect to certain of those factors is provided below.\nTypically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions can create challenging working environments that are more costly for our customers or cause delays on projects. In addition, infrastructure projects often do not begin in a meaningful way until our customers finalize their capital budgets, which typically occurs during the first quarter. Second quarter revenues are typically higher than those in the first quarter, as some projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often impact productivity. Third quarter and fourth quarter revenues are typically the highest of the year, as a greater number of projects are underway and operating conditions, including weather, are normally more accommodating. During the fourth quarter, projects are often completed and customers often seek to spend their capital budgets before year end. However, the holiday season and inclement weather can sometimes cause delays during the fourth quarter, reducing revenues and increasing costs. These seasonal impacts are typical for our U.S. operations, but seasonality for our international operations may differ. For example, revenues for certain projects in Canada are typically higher in the first quarter because projects are often accelerated in order to complete work while the ground is frozen and prior to the break up, or seasonal thaw, as productivity is adversely affected by wet ground conditions during warmer months.\nWeather, natural disasters and emergencies.\nThe results of our business in a given period can be impacted by adverse weather conditions, severe weather events, natural disasters or other emergencies, which include, among other things, heavy or prolonged snowfall or rainfall, hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods, blizzards, extreme temperatures, wildfires, post-wildfire floods and debris flows, pandemics and earthquakes. Climate change has the potential to increase the frequency and extremity of severe weather events. These conditions and events can negatively impact our financial results due to, among other things, the termination, deferral or delay of projects, reduced productivity and exposure to significant liabilities due to failure of electrical power or other infrastructure on which we have performed services. However, severe weather events can also increase our emergency restoration services, which typically yield higher margins due in part to higher equipment utilization and absorption of fixed costs.\n. We perform the majority of our services under existing contracts, including MSAs and similar agreements pursuant to which our customers are not committed to specific volumes of our services. Therefore our volume of business can be positively or negatively affected by fluctuations in the amount of work our customers assign us in a given period, which may vary by geographic region. Examples of items that may cause demand for our services to fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter include: the financial condition of our customers, their capital spending and their access to and cost of capital; acceleration of any projects or programs by customers (e.g., modernization or hardening programs); economic and political conditions on a regional, national or global scale, including availability of renewable energy tax credits; interest rates; governmental regulations affecting the sourcing and costs of materials and equipment; other changes in U.S. and global trade relationships (e.g., tariffs, taxes); and project deferrals and cancellations.\nRevenue mix and impact on margins.\nThe mix of revenues based on the types of services we provide in a given period will impact margins, as certain industries and services provide higher-margin opportunities. Our larger or more complex projects typically include, among others, transmission projects with higher voltage capacities; pipeline projects with larger-diameter throughput capacities; large-scale renewable generation projects; complex data center projects; and projects with increased engineering, design or construction complexities, more difficult terrain or geographical requirements, or longer distance requirements. These projects typically yield opportunities for higher margins than our recurring services under MSAs described above, as we assume a greater degree of performance risk and there is greater utilization of our resources for longer construction timeframes. However, larger projects are subject to additional risk of regulatory delay and cyclicality. Project schedules also fluctuate, particularly in connection with larger, more complex or longer-term projects, which can affect the amount of work performed in a given period. Furthermore, smaller or less complex projects typically have a greater number of companies competing for them, and competitors at times may more aggressively pursue available work. A greater percentage of smaller scale or less complex work also could negatively impact margins due to the inefficiency of transitioning between a\ngreater number of smaller projects versus continuous production on fewer larger projects. As a result, at times we may choose to maintain a portion of our workforce and equipment in an underutilized capacity to ensure we are strategically positioned to deliver on larger projects when they move forward.\nProject variability and performance.\nMargins for a single project may fluctuate period to period due to changes in the volume or type of work performed, the pricing structure under the project contract or job productivity. Additionally, our productivity and performance on a project can vary period to period based on a number of factors, including unexpected project difficulties or site conditions (including in connection with difficult geographic characteristics); project location, including locations with challenging operating conditions; whether the work is on an open or encumbered right of way; inclement weather or severe weather events; environmental restrictions or regulatory delays; protests, public activism, other political activity or legal challenges related to a project; and the performance of third parties. Moreover, we currently generate a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts, and fixed price contracts are more common in connection with our larger and more complex projects that typically involve greater performance risk. Under these contracts, we assume risks related to project estimates and execution, and project revenues can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including the additional complexity, timing uncertainty or extended bidding, regulatory and permitting processes associated with these projects. These variations can result in a reduction in expected profit, the incurrence of losses on a project or the issuance of change orders and/or assertion of contract claims against customers. See\nContract Estimates and Changes in Estimates\nin Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nin Part II of this Annual Report.\nSubcontract work and provision of materials.\nWork that is subcontracted to other service providers generally yields lower margins, and therefore an increase in subcontract work in a given period can decrease operating margins. In recent years, we have subcontracted approximately 20% of our work to other service providers. Additionally, under certain contracts, including contracts for engineering, procurement and construction services, we agree to procure all or part of the required materials. While we attempt to structure our agreements with customers and suppliers to account for the impact of increased materials procurement requirements or fluctuations in the cost of materials we procure, our margins may be lower on projects where we furnish a significant amount of materials, as our markup on materials is generally lower than our markup on labor costs, and in a given period an increase in the percentage of work with greater materials procurement requirements may decrease our overall margins, including in some cases our assuming price risk. Furthermore, fluctuations in the price or availability of materials, equipment and consumables that we or our customers utilize could impact costs to complete projects.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table sets forth selected statements of operations data, such data as a percentage of revenues for the years indicated, as well as the dollar and percentage change from the prior year (dollars in thousands).\n\nEquity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nAmortization of intangible assets\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities\nInterest and other financing expenses\nIncome before income taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nLess: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\nNet income attributable to common stock\nRevenues increased due to a $1.68 billion increase in revenues from our Renewable Energy segment and a $1.47 billion increase in revenues from our Electric Power segment, partially offset by a $354.6 million decrease in revenues from our Underground and Infrastructure segment.
