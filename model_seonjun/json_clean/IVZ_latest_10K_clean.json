  "item1_clean": "As of December 31, 2024, the company had 8,508 (December 31, 2023:\n) employees with an on-the-ground presence in over 20 countries. Our employees are not covered under collective bargaining agreements.\nThe company is committed to reducing our impact on the environment. Across Invesco offices, we carefully manage our operational activities with a focus on using natural resources wisely, increasing efficiencies wherever possible and providing a safe and healthy workplace for employees and visitors. This is the foundation of our environmental, health and safety management approach.\nThe investment management business is highly competitive, with points of differentiation including investment performance, fees, range of products offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, depth and continuity of relationships and quality of service. We compete with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, investment banks, broker-dealers, hedge funds, insurance companies and, increasingly, firms outside the traditional financial services industry, such as technology providers. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and higher brand recognition than Invesco. However, we believe our experience as a trusted partner to clients, the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities, product types and channels of distribution, and our commitment to innovation enable us to compete effectively in the global investment management business. There are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as Invesco's and the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles. We offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage. We also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage, as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute and/or service those products. Lastly, we believe continued execution against our strategic objectives will further strengthen our long-term competitive position.\nManagement Contracts\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts. Fees vary with the type of assets being managed, with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts, along with real estate and other alternative asset products, and with lower fees earned on fixed income, money market and stable value accounts, and ETFs. Investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days' notice. Typically, retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice and institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with investment managers or reduce the aggregate amount of AUM with very short notice periods.\nInvesco is committed to continually strengthening and evolving our risk management approach and activities to ensure they keep pace with business change and client expectations. We believe a key factor in our ability to manage through challenging market conditions and significant business change is our integrated and global approach to risk management. We seek to embed risk management in our day-to-day decision-making as well as our strategic planning process, while our global risk management framework seeks to enable consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up, down and across the company.\nOur framework leverages two governance structures: (i) our Global Investment Risk and Performance Committee oversees the management of core investment risks; and (ii) our Enterprise Risk Management Committee oversees the management of all other business- and strategy-related risks. A network of regional, business unit and risk-specific management committees, with oversight by the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, provides ongoing identification, assessment, management, monitoring, and reporting of existing and emerging risks across all domains of our business.\nAvailable Information\n\nInvesco Ltd. (the Parent), along with its consolidated entities (collectively, Invesco or the company), is an independent investment management firm dedicated to delivering a superior investment experience. Our comprehensive range of active, passive and alternative investment capabilities has been constructed over many years to help clients achieve their investment objectives. We draw on this comprehensive range of capabilities to provide solutions designed to deliver key outcomes aligned to client needs.\nWith approximately 8,500 employees and an on-the-ground presence in more than 20 countries, Invesco is well positioned to meet the needs of investors across the globe. We have specialized investment teams managing investments across a broad range of asset classes, investment styles and geographies. For decades, individuals and institutions have viewed Invesco as a trusted partner for a comprehensive set of investment needs. We have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC), serving clients in more than 120 countries. As of December 31, 2024, the firm managed approximately $1.85 trillion in assets for investors around the world.\nThe key drivers of success for Invesco are long-term investment performance, high-quality client service, effective distribution relationships delivered across a diverse spectrum of investment management capabilities, distribution channels, geographic areas and market exposures, and competitive pricing. Through our focus on these areas, we seek to deliver better outcomes for clients, generate competitive investment results and positive net flows, and increase AUM and revenues.\nWe measure relative investment performance by comparing our investment capabilities to competitors' products, industry benchmarks and client investment objectives. Generally, distributors, investment advisors and consultants take into consideration longer-term investment performance (e.g., three-year and five-year performance) in their selection of investment products and recommendations to their clients. Third-party ratings may also influence client investment decisions. We monitor the quality of client service in a variety of ways, including periodic client satisfaction surveys, analysis of response times and redemption rates, competitive benchmarking of services and feedback from investment consultants.\nThe company is organized under the laws of Bermuda. Our common shares are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “IVZ.” We maintain a website at www.invesco.com/corporate. (Information contained on our website shall not be deemed to be part of, or be incorporated into, this document.)\n\nEmbed next generation technology across all aspects of the business\nStrengthen financial flexibility emphasizing operating leverage\nAs an integrated global investment manager, we are keenly focused on meeting clients' needs and operating effectively and efficiently. We take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under one operating segment, “investment management.”\nA key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain well-performing investment capabilities. We believe the ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm.\nInvestment Management Capabilities\nWe believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their well-defined investment disciplines and risk management approaches provide us with a robust competitive advantage. There are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as Invesco's and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles. We offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage. Our asset classes, broadly defined, include equity, fixed income, balanced, alternatives and money market.\nDistribution Channels\nRetail AUM typically originate from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units. Institutional AUM originate from entities such as individual corporate clients, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, government authorities, universities or charities. AUM disclosed as retail AUM include AUM distributed by the company's retail sales teams. AUM disclosed as institutional AUM include AUM distributed by the company's institutional sales teams.\nThe company operates as an integrated global investment manager. Dedicated sales forces deliver our investment strategies through a variety of vehicles that meet the needs of retail and institutional clients. Note that not all products sold in the retail distribution channel are in \"retail\" vehicles, and not all products sold in the institutional channel are in \"institutional\" vehicles, as described in the table below. This aggregation, however, is viewed as a proxy for presenting AUM in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate.\nThe following lists our primary investment vehicles by distribution channel:\n\nRetail AUM were $1,265.6 billion at December 31, 2024. We offer retail products within all of the major asset classes. Our retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial intermediaries, including major wire houses, direct wealth platforms, regional broker-dealers, insurance companies, banks and financial planners in the Americas, and independent brokers and financial advisors, banks and direct wealth platforms in EMEA and APAC.\nThe Americas and EMEA retail operations rank among the largest by AUM in their respective markets. As of December 31, 2024, Invesco's U.S. retail business, including our ETFs franchise, is among the leading asset managers in the U.S., and Invesco's retail business in EMEA is among the largest non-proprietary investment managers in the retail channel. In addition, Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (IGW or Invesco Great Wall), our joint venture in China, is one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with total AUM of approximately $93.2 billion at December 31, 2024. We provide our retail clients with one of the industry's most robust and comprehensive product lines.\nInstitutional AUM were $580.4 billion at December 31, 2024. We offer a broad suite of domestic and global strategies, including traditional and quantitative equities, fixed income (including money market funds for institutional clients), real estate, financial structures and absolute return strategies. Regional sales forces distribute our products and provide services to clients and intermediaries around the world. We have a diversified client base that includes major public and private entities, unions, non-profit organizations, endowments, foundations, pension funds, financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds. Invesco's institutional money market funds serve some of the largest financial institutions, government entities and companies in the world.\nOne of Invesco's competitive strengths is the diversification of AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and investment capability. We serve clients in more than 120 countries. The following tables present a breakdown of AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and investment capability as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, the fourth table below illustrates the split of our AUM as Passive and Active. Passive AUM include index-based ETFs, UITs, non-management fee earning AUM and other passive mandates. Active AUM are total AUM less Passive AUM. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in AUM for the year ended December 31",
  "item7_clean": "Service and Distribution Fees\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, Service and distribution fees were $1,479.7 million as compared to $1,374.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher distribution fees of $91.2 million and administrative fees of $12.9 million resulting from higher average AUM to which the fees apply.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, Performance fees were $46.4 million as compared to $46.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Performance fees for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were primarily generated from multi-asset/other, private markets real estate and fundamental equities products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, Other revenues were $198.6 million as compared to $189.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Other revenues was primarily driven by higher front end fees of $10.0 million and real estate transaction fees of $4.1 million, partially offset by lower other transaction fees of $4.6 million.\nThe company’s most significant joint venture is our investment in IGW. The company reflects 100% of IGW's results in its Net revenues and Adjusted operating expenses because it is important to evaluate the contribution that IGW is making to the business. The company’s non-GAAP operating results reflect the economics of these holdings on a basis consistent with the underlying AUM and flows. Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. is reduced by the amount of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of Net revenues.\nNet revenues from IGW were $318.1 million and average AUM was $88.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 (Net revenues were\nand average AUM was $87.2 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2023). The decrease in IGW revenues was primarily driven by the shift in AUM toward lower yield products and the introduction of regulatory mandated fee reductions in China in August 2023.\nCIP\nManagement believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of CIP in calculating Net revenues. As Management and Performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these Operating revenues back in the calculation of Net revenues. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of Net revenues.\nManagement and Performance fees earned from CIP were $41.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe main categories of operating expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods, are as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory\nEmployee compensation\nProperty, office and technology\nGeneral and administrative\nTransaction, integration and restructuring\nN/A\nAmortization and impairment of intangibles\nTotal operating expenses\nThe table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total Operating expenses and Operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense.\n% of Total Operating Expenses\n% of Operating Revenues\n% of Total Operating Expenses\n% of Operating Revenues\n% of Total Operating Expenses\n% of Operating Revenues\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory\nEmployee compensation\nProperty, office and technology\nGeneral and administrative\nTransaction, integration and restructuring\nAmortization and impairment of intangibles\nTotal operating expenses\n1) Comparative periods presented reflect reclassification of certain operating expenses to align with current period presentation. The reclassification had no impact on our reported Operating revenues, Operating income, Net income, or any internal performance measure on which management is compensated. See Note\n, \"Accounting Policies,\" for additional information.\n(2) Transaction, integration and restructuring charges were primarily restructuring costs relating to our strategic evaluation which we completed in the first quarter of 2023.\nOperating expenses decreased $916.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The year ended December 31, 2023 included a $1,248.9 million non-cash impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets related to prior acquisitions of management contracts of U.S. retail mutual funds. The year ended December 31, 2024 included a one-time acceleration of $147.6 million in Employee compensation expense resulting from changes to the retirement criteria for vesting of currently outstanding common share-based awards and other long-term awards (collectively, Long-term awards). Excluding the intangible asset impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the acceleration of Employee compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $185.0 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The year ended December 31, 2023 included a $1,248.9 million non-cash impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets related to management contracts of U.S. retail mutual funds.\nOperating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin\nOperating income was $832.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to an operating loss of $434.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues) increased to 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from (7.6)% in the year ended December 31, 2023. The operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the $1,248.9 million intangible asset impairment as discussed above.\nAdjusted operating income increased to $1,370.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $1,213.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted operating margin increased to 31.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of Operating revenues to Net revenues, a reconciliation of Operating income to Adjusted operating income and additional important disclosures regarding Net revenues, Adjusted operating income and Adjusted operating margin.\nOther Income and Expenses\nThe main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\nInterest and dividend income\nOther gains and losses, net\nN/A\nOther income/(expense) of CIP, net\nTotal other income and expenses\nN/A\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased to $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in income of $13.5 million from our joint venture investment in IGW and $9.6 million from our private markets real estate investments.\nInterest and dividend income\nInterest and dividend income was $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in dividend income earned on our private markets, deferred compensation and seed capital investments and higher interest income earned from Cash and cash equivalents.\nInterest expense was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as a result of the decrease in outstanding debt.\nOther gains and losses, net\nOther gains and losses, net was a gain of $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to a net gain of $98.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The net gain for the year ended December 31, 2023 also included a $45 million gain on the sale of certain Hong Kong pension sponsorship rights.\n\nSummary Operating Information\nWherever a non-GAAP measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-GAAP measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. To enhance the readability of the Results of Operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense and other income and expenses (non-operating income/expense) sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company’s income statements for the periods presented.\nSummary operating information for 2024, 2023 and 2022 is presented in the table below.\n(in millions, other than per common share amounts, operating margins and AUM)\nYear ended December 31,\nU.S. GAAP Financial Measures Summary\nOperating income/(loss)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Invesco Ltd.\nDiluted earnings per share (EPS)\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Summary\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating margin\nAdjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)\nAssets Under Management\nEnding AUM (billions)\nAverage AUM (billions)\nNet revenues, Adjusted Operating Income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and Adjusted Net Income (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures, based on methodologies other than U.S. GAAP. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures.\n\nThird-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include periodic “renewal” commissions which are paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for providing services to their client accounts while they are invested in an Invesco product. Renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the AUM value and apply to much of the company's non-U.S. retail operations. The revenues from the company’s U.S. retail operations include 12b-1 distribution fees, which are largely passed through to brokers who sell the funds as third-party distribution expenses along with additional marketing support distribution costs. Both the revenues and the costs are dependent on the underlying AUM of the brokers' clients. The upfront distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period. Also included in Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client common share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. These costs are reimbursed by the related funds.\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory expenses were $2,025.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $1,825.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $112.9 million in service costs and $86.3 million in administrative and other third-party management fees resulting from higher average AUM and fund related costs. See \"Schedule of Non-GAAP Information\" for additional disclosures.\nEmployee Compensation\nEmployee compensation includes salary, cash bonuses and long-term incentive plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees. Employee staff benefit plan costs and payroll taxes are also included in Employee compensation.\nEmployee compensation was $2,014.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $1,885.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the previously noted acceleration of expense for currently outstanding Long-term awards of $147.6 million, higher variable compensation costs of $47.5 million and an increase of $29.2 million in expense related to the mark-to-market on deferred compensation liabilities. The increase was partially offset by lower costs related to executive retirements and organizational changes of $82.5 million.\nHeadcount at December 31, 2024 was 8,508 (December 31, 2023; 8,489).\nMarketing expenses include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications, television and other media, and public relations costs, such as the marketing of the company's products through conferences or other sponsorships.\nMarketing expenses were $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nProperty, Office and Technology\nProperty, office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities, depreciation of company-owned property, equipment and software, and other technology expenses including maintenance and licensing fees.\nProperty, office and technology expenses were $474.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $450.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher software costs of $21.2 million.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include information service subscriptions, irrecoverable indirect taxes, employee travel, professional fees, recruitment and training costs as well as costs for outsourced services such as technology, middle office and back office management services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $594.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $567.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $52.5 million expense related to the settlement of regulatory matters partially offset by lower professional fees of $28.1 million.\n\nReconciliation of Net income/(loss) attributable to Invesco to Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco:\n(in millions, except per common share data)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Invesco Ltd., U.S. GAAP basis\nAdjustments (excluding tax):\nTransaction, integration and restructuring\nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets\nDeferred compensation net market valuation changes\nOne-time acceleration of compensation expense for currently outstanding Long-term awards\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal adjustments excluding tax\nTax adjustment for amortization of intangible assets and goodwill\nTax adjustment for impairment of intangible assets\nOther tax effects of adjustments above\nAdjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.\nAverage common shares outstanding - diluted\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n(1) Revenue adjustments: The company calculates Net revenues by reducing Operating revenues to exclude fees that are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company’s managed funds.
