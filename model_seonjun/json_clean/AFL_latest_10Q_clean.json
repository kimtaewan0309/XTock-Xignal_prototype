The annualized return on average shareholders’ equity in the third quarter of 2025 was 23.5%.\nShareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)\n(adjusted book value) was $28.0 billion, or $53.33 per share, at September 30, 2025, compared with $29.1 billion, or $52.87 per share, at December 31, 2024. Adjusted book value excluding foreign currency remeasurement\nwas $24.4 billion, or $46.35 per share, at September 30, 2025, compared with $23.4 billion, or $42.46 per share, at December 31, 2024. The annualized adjusted return on equity (ROE) excluding foreign currency remeasurement\nin the third quarter of 2025 was 22.1%.\nAs previously disclosed\n, the Company identified an incident involving unauthorized access to its network in the U.S. on June 12, 2025. The Company promptly initiated its cybersecurity incident response protocols and continues to believe it contained the intrusion within hours. The Company's systems were not affected by ransomware, and the Company continues to serve its policyholders and underwrite policies, review claims, and otherwise service customers as usual. The Company also remains engaged with leading third-party cybersecurity experts to support the Company’s response to the incident.\nThe Company is aware of the exfiltration of certain data including claims information, health information, social security numbers and/or other personal information relating to a substantial number of customers, beneficiaries, employees, agents, and other individuals in the Company’s U.S. business. The Company is still in the process of validating the extent and nature of the files that were involved.\nBased on the information currently available and the investigation to date, as of the date of this report, the Company has not determined that the incident is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. However, the Company’s investigation remains ongoing and as a result, it does not yet know the full impact of the cybersecurity incident, including how much of the financial impact will be covered by insurance. As a result of the cybersecurity incident, the Company has incurred certain costs and may, depending on future developments, incur additional costs, including but not limited to: costs to provide credit monitoring, identity theft protection, and Medical Shield to impacted individuals and maintain a call center related to the provision of such services; incident response costs; expenses arising from potential litigation, governmental investigations, or enforcement actions; expenses related to compliance, finance, and legal advisory services; elevated cybersecurity insurance premiums; and costs incurred in meeting evolving legal and regulatory requirements concerning cybersecurity governance, monitoring, and disclosure. The costs associated with the incident to date, including the cost to investigate and respond to the incident as well as related legal and other professional services, resulted in a slight increase to the Company's expenses and are recorded in the insurance and other expenses line in the consolidated statement of earnings.\nYen/U.S. dollar exchange rates are based on the published MUFG Bank, Ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate (TTM).\nSee the Results of Operations section of this MD&A for a definition of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company earns its revenues principally from insurance premiums and investments. The Company’s operating expenses primarily consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits, general business expenses, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing its products. Profitability for the Company depends principally on its ability to price its insurance products at a level that enables the Company to earn a margin over the costs associated with providing benefits and administering those products. Profitability also depends on, among other items, actuarial and policyholder behavior experience on insurance products, and the Company's ability to attract and retain customer assets, generate and maintain favorable investment results, effectively deploy capital and utilize tax capacity, and manage expenses.\nThis document includes references to the Company’s financial performance measures which are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) (non-U.S. GAAP). The financial measures exclude items that the Company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations.\nDue to the size of Aflac Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior\nperiod. A significant portion of the Company’s business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, which results in foreign currency impact to earnings, cash flows and book value on a U.S. GAAP basis. Management evaluates the Company's financial performance both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation to monitor, respectively, cumulative currency impacts and the currency-neutral operating performance over time. The average yen/dollar exchange rate is based on the published MUFG Bank, Ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate (TTM).\nThe Company defines the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this document as follows:\nare adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. Adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are the adjusted earnings for the period divided by the weighted average outstanding shares (basic or diluted) for the period presented. The adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that are outside of management’s control because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or are related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations. Adjusted revenues are U.S. GAAP total revenues excluding adjusted net investment gains and losses. Adjusted expenses are U.S. GAAP total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest from derivatives associated with notes payable but excluding any non-recurring or other items not associated with the normal course of the Company’s insurance operations and that do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance. Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of the Company’s insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of these financial measures is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company’s insurance business. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.\nAdjusted net investment gains and losses\nare net investment gains and losses adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, ii) net interest income/expense from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are both reclassified to net investment income, and iii) the impact of interest from derivatives associated with notes payable, which is reclassified to interest expense as a component of total adjusted expenses. The Company considers adjusted net investment gains and losses important as it represents the remainder amount that is considered outside management’s control, while excluding the components that are within management’s control and are accordingly reclassified to net investment income and interest expense. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment gains and losses is net investment gains and losses.\nAmortized hedge costs/income\nrepresent costs/income incurred or recognized as a result of using foreign currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign exchange risks in the Company's Japan segment or in Corporate and other. These amortized hedge costs/income are estimated at the inception of the derivatives based on the specific terms of each contract and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the derivative. The Company believes that amortized hedge costs/income measure the periodic currency risk management costs/income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income. There is no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for amortized hedge costs/income.\nAdjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact\nare computed using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior-year period, which eliminates fluctuations driven solely by foreign currency exchange rate changes. Adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares for the p"
