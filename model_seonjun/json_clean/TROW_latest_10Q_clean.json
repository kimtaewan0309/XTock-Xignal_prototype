We also provide certain investment advisory clients with related administrative services, including distribution, mutual fund transfer agent, accounting, and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans; brokerage; trust services; and non-discretionary advisory services.\nInvestment advisory fees depend largely on the total value and composition of our assets under management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe incur significant expenditures to develop new products and services and improve and expand our capabilities and distribution channels in order to attract new clients and additional investments from our existing clients. These efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management.\nThe investment management industry is evolving, facing challenging trends such as passive strategies taking market share from traditional active strategies; continued downward fee pressure; demand for new investment vehicles to meet client needs; and an ever-changing regulatory landscape. In this regard, we have ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities. Furthermore, we have developed a broad and ongoing plan to align our expense growth with anticipated revenue growth. As a result, we have initiated certain actions to reduce expense growth, realign resources, and invest in existing and future capabilities, while also helping to offset ongoing inflationary pressures on compensation and contractual spending. These investments include hiring investment and distribution professionals, adopting new technologies, and offering new products to provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and services.\nMARKET TRENDS.\nMajor stock indexes rose in the third quarter of 2025. Initially, equities were supported by generally favorable economic data and second-quarter corporate earnings reports, as well as some positive tariff-related news in the form of U.S. trade agreements with other nations. In August, however, a weaker-than-expected nonfarm payroll employment report for July—which included significant downward revisions to employment data for May and June—raised fears of an economic slowdown. Nevertheless, equities were buoyed by growing hopes that the Federal Reserve would resume reducing short-term interest rates; the last rate cut was in December 2024. Indeed, Fed officials decided in mid-September to reduce the fed funds target rate by 25 basis points and indicated there could be two additional rate cuts by the end of the year.\nDeveloped non-U.S. equity markets also produced gains. Markets in several eurozone countries advanced more than 8% in U.S. dollar terms, while UK shares rose about 6%. Developed Asian markets were mostly positive in dollar terms, led by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.\nStocks in emerging markets outperformed equities in developed non-U.S. markets. In emerging Asia, Chinese stocks climbed more than 20%, helped by cash-rich households seeking higher returns. In Latin America, most markets produced positive returns in dollar terms. In the emerging Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, markets were broadly positive. South African shares surged more than 20%, helped by rising metals prices and mining industry strength.\nReturns of several major equity market indexes were as follows:\nNASDAQ Composite Index\nMSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and Far East) Index\nMSCI Emerging Markets Index\n\nS\ntrong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting and retaining assets—and to our long-term success.

Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%,10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars). The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund’s 3, 5, and 10 year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following table and discussion sets forth information regarding our consolidated financial results for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 on a U.S. GAAP and a non-GAAP basis.
