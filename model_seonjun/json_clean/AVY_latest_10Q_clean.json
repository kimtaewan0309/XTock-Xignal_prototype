MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe report our financial results in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and also communicate with investors using certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for or superior to, the comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the presentation of our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate trends in our underlying performance, as well as to facilitate comparisons with the results of competitors for quarters and year-to-date periods, as applicable. Based on feedback from investors and financial analysts, we believe that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures we provide are also useful to their assessments of our performance and operating trends, as well as liquidity. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in accordance with Regulations G and S-K.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP financial measures, may make it more difficult to assess our underlying performance in a single period. By excluding the accounting effects, positive or negative, of certain items (e.g., restructuring charges, outcomes of certain legal matters and settlements, certain effects of strategic transactions and related costs, losses from debt extinguishments, gains or losses from curtailment or settlement of pension obligations, gains or losses on sales of certain assets, gains or losses on venture and other investments, currency adjustments due to highly inflationary economies, and other items), we believe that we are providing meaningful supplemental information that facilitates an understanding of our core operating results and liquidity measures. While some of the items we exclude from GAAP financial measures recur, they tend to be disparate in amount, frequency or timing.\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measures defined below in this MD&A.\nSales change ex. currency\nrefers to the increase or decrease in net sales, excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, and, where applicable, the currency adjustments for transitional reporting of highly inflationary economies and the reclassification of sales between segments. Additionally, where applicable, sales change ex. currency is also adjusted for extra days in our fiscal year and the calendar shift resulting from extra days in the prior fiscal year. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation is calculated on a constant currency basis, with prior-period results translated at current-period average exchange rates to exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Our 2025 fiscal year that began on December 29, 2024 will end on December 31, 2025; fiscal years 2026 and beyond will be coincident with the calendar year beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31.\nOrganic sales change\nrefers to sales change ex. currency, excluding the estimated impact of acquisitions and product line divestitures.\nWe believe that sales change ex. currency and organic sales change assist investors in evaluating the sales change from the ongoing activities of our businesses and enhance their ability to evaluate our results from period to period.\nAdjusted free cash flow\nrefers to cash flow provided by operating activities, less payments for property, plant and equipment, less payments for software and other deferred charges, plus proceeds from company-owned life insurance policies, plus proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, plus (minus) net proceeds from insurance and sales (purchases) of investments, less net cash used for Argentine Blue Chip Swap securities. Where applicable, adjusted free cash flow is also adjusted for certain acquisition-related transaction costs. We believe that adjusted free cash flow assists investors by showing the amount of cash we have available for debt reductions, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions.\nOperational working capital as a percentage of annualized current quarter net sales\nrefers to trade accounts receivable and inventories, net of accounts payable, and excludes cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, deferred taxes, other current assets and other current liabilities divided by annualized current quarter net sales. We believe that operational working capital as a percentage of annualized current quarter net sales assists investors in assessing our working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of fluctuations attributable to our financing and other activities (which affect cash and cash equivalents, deferred taxes, other current assets and other current liabilities) that tend to be disparate in amount, frequency or timing, and may increase the volatility of working capital as a percentage of sales from period to period. The items excluded from this measure are not significantly influenced by our day-to-day activities managed at the operating level and do not necessarily reflect the underlying trends in our operations.\nAvery Dennison Corporation\nOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK\nIn January 2025, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors approved a change to our previous 52- or 53-week fiscal year generally ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 to a fiscal year coincident with the calendar year. Our 2025 fiscal year that began on December 29, 2024 will end on December 31, 2025; fiscal years 2026 and beyond will begin on January 1 and end on December 31.\nThe factors impacting reported net sales change, as compared to the prior-year period, are shown in the table below.\nReported net sales change\nForeign currency translation\nSales change ex. currency\nOrganic sales change\nTotals may not sum due to rounding.\n\nIn the three months and nine months ended September 27, 2025, net sales on an organic basis were comparable with the same periods in the prior year.\nNet income decreased from approximately $531 million in the first nine months of 2024 to approximately $522 million in the first nine months of 2025. The primary factors affecting this decrease were:\nThe net impact of raw material deflation-related price reductions\nHigher provision for income taxes\nThese items were partially offset by the following factors:\nBenefits from productivity initiatives, including material re-engineering and savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs\nCost Reduction Actions\nWe recorded $22.8 million in restructuring charges, net of reversals, during the nine months ended September 27, 2025. These charges consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 770 positions, as well as asset impairment charges, at various locations across our company. Our 2025 actions are primarily intended to optimize our operational footprint.\nRestructuring charges were included in “Other expense (income), net” in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 4, “Cost Reduction Actions,” to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAvery Dennison Corporation\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment\nPurchases of software and other deferred charges\nPurchases of Argentine Blue Chip Swap securities\nProceeds from sales of Argentine Blue Chip Swap securities\nProceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment\nProceeds from insurance and sales (purchases) of investments, net\nAdjusted free cash flow\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, net cash provided by operating activities decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher incentive compensation payments, changes in operational working capital, higher tax payments, net of refunds, and higher trade rebate payments, partially offset by the prior-year settlement payment for the Adasa legal matter. During the first nine months of 2025, adjusted free cash flow decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by lower purchases of property, plant and equipment and higher proceeds from the sales of property, plant and equipment.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2025, the U.S. announced tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. from numerous countries, many of which responded with reciprocal tariffs and other actions on goods imported from the U.S. The U.S. government continues to negotiate with other countries regarding the tariffs. As it relates to the direct impact of these tariffs, a relatively small portion of our global materials purchases is impacted. To mitigate this direct impact to our operations, we have implemented strategic sourcing adjustments and pricing surcharges. The indirect impact on demand for our products and solutions is more uncertain. While a majority of our products and solutions relates to less discretionary consumer staples, we also serve more discretionary and cyclical markets, such as industrials, durables and apparel. We estimate that the indirect impact of tariffs resulted in an aggregate low single digit rate decrease in sales in our overall apparel categories over the second and third quarters of 2025.\nCertain factors that we believe may contribute to or impact our 2025 results are described below.\nWe anticipate continued uncertainty related to trade policy"
