The increase reflected higher retail customer rates in certain territories and higher retail customer volumes, partially offset by higher energy costs and lower wholesale volumes and prices. Retail customer volumes increased 3.6% overall (up 6.5% at NV Energy, 3.1% at PacifiCorp and 1.2% at MEC) in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in customer usage and the average number of customers, partially offset by an overall unfavorable impact of weather. The increase in other energy operating expenses was primarily due to higher vegetation management and other wildfire mitigation costs, insurance expenses and general and plant maintenance costs. Interest expense increased $314 million in 2024 over 2023, largely due to increased borrowings, including $4.4 billion of subsidiary term debt issued in January 2024 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5%.\n\nConsumer products group pre-tax earnings increased $172 million (10.9%) in 2024 versus 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher earnings from our apparel and footwear businesses and Duracell, partially offset by lower earnings from Jazwares. Apparel and footwear earnings increased 37.0% in 2024 from 2023, primarily due to gross sales margin rate increases from lower sales markdowns, lower manufacturing costs and increased gains on asset sales, as well as from the favorable effects of past restructuring and cost management efforts. The earnings increase at Duracell was attributable to increased gross sales margins and lower selling, general and administrative expenses, including lower restructuring costs. The decline in earnings from Jazwares in 2024 was primarily due to increased amortization expense, as well as reduced orders from retailers during the fourth quarter.\n\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.4 billion (12.8%) and the loss ratio increased 2.1 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023. Losses incurred included reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior accident years’ claims of $52 million in 2024 and $537 million in 2023. The comparative decline reflected a significant increase in loss estimates at GUARD and lower reductions in estimated losses across several of our other businesses that write medical professional liability and commercial liability coverages, partially offset by increased reductions of property loss estimates. During 2024, due to deteriorating loss experience, management at GUARD performed a comprehensive review of claims and significantly increased estimated ultimate claim liabilities. The reduction of favorable development of prior years’ liability claims estimates across our other businesses was attributable to unfavorable social inflation trends, including the impacts of jury awards and litigation costs. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events were approximately $350 million in 2024 and were minimal in 2023.\n\nBHRG’s property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses could be materially higher or lower than the liabilities as of December 31, 2024 due to the inherent uncertainty of determining ultimate claims costs for claims that have occurred or will be deemed to have occurred as of the balance sheet date. We currently believe, however, that significant upward revisions to claims estimates are more likely for casualty claims, given longer claims tails and evolving inflation, legal, judicial and mass tort risks, including the manifestation of new forms of claims that were not contemplated when the policies were written. We believe a five percent increase in BHRG’s casualty claim liabilities over time is reasonably possible, although this should not be viewed as a worst-case scenario given the risks identified. An increase of this magnitude to our gross liabilities for casualty claims at December 31, 2024 could produce an increase in casualty liabilities of $1.75 billion, with a corresponding decrease to pre-tax earnings.\n\nIMC’s revenues were approximately $3.9 billion in 2024, a decrease of 2.2% compared to 2023. The decline reflected lower organic sales attributable to sluggish customer demand across all major regions, and unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the impact of business acquisitions and higher investment income. The decline in organic sales was attributable to weaker general economic conditions and ongoing geopolitical conflicts. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 7.8% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to lower sales and gross margin rates and increased selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher investment and other income. IMC operates globally and a large portion of its products are manufactured in Israel. IMC’s operations in Israel have not been significantly impacted by the conflicts in the region.\n\nPilot’s pre-tax earnings declined $442 million (41.9%) in 2024 compared to the full year 2023. Gross sales margins declined 4.3% in 2024 compared to the full year 2023, attributable to lower diesel margins from lower price volatility. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.3% in 2024 compared to the full year 2023, reflecting increased depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as labor, marketing and maintenance costs. Interest expense declined 30.9% in 2024 compared to the full year 2023, attributable to reduced borrowings and lower rates. In March 2024, Pilot borrowed $5.7 billion from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries and repaid its third-party borrowings. Pilot subsequently repaid $1.0 billion of the affiliate borrowings in 2024. The interest on Pilot’s borrowings from affiliates is included in insurance investment income on page K-39.\n\nService group pre-tax earnings declined 23.0% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to TTI, the aviation services businesses and XTRA. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues fell 3.4 percentage points in 2024 to 11.1% compared to 2023. Earnings from TTI declined 51.0% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting the impact of lower sales and price competition, which contributed to reduced gross sales margin rates, and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Earnings from aviation services declined 10.9% in 2024 versus 2023, primarily attributable to increased costs of services and leasing, driven by higher flight crew, maintenance, fuel costs and depreciation expense, as well as increased impairment charges. The decline at XTRA was primarily due to lower revenues and increased costs.\n\nRetailing group pre-tax earnings were $1.7 billion in 2023, unchanged from 2022. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 17.7%, primarily due to earnings increases from the parts/service/repair and finance/service contract operations, as well as from higher investment income and lower selling, general and administrative and other expenses, partially offset by lower vehicle gross profit margin rates and higher floor plan interest expense. BHA’s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates peaked in mid-2022 and declined through 2023. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $168 million (21.8%) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a 28.3% decrease in home furnishings businesses earnings and the impact of a gain in 2022 from the divestiture of certain jewelry stores.\n\nPre-tax earnings of the service group decreased $52 million (1.7%) in 2023 to $3.0 billion. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues declined 1.5 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings decline reflected lower earnings from TTI and certain of our other service businesses, partially offset by increased earnings from aviation services and the impact of the IPS acquisition. Earnings from TTI declined 17.3% in 2023, attributable to reduced sales and gross margin rates and higher operating expenses, partly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange gains in 2023. The increase in earnings from aviation services was primarily attributable to a 14.4% increase in average aircraft within NetJets’ programs and higher rates.\n\nPre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $61 million (2.9%) in 2024 compared to 2023. Earnings as a percentage of revenues increased 0.9 percentage points in 2024 to 15.6% compared to 2023. Earnings increased in 2024 from higher average gross margin rates arising from lower raw material costs and improved manufacturing efficiencies at certain of the businesses, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of lower sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses in each year included losses from business restructuring activities and divestitures, as well as legal settlements and accruals.\n\nPre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $2.0 billion in 2023, a decrease of $326 million (13.8%) compared to 2022. Earnings in 2023 reflected lower earnings from the home building businesses, partially offset by increased earnings from financial services. The decline in earnings from the home building businesses reflected the reduction in sales, a lower overall gross sales margin rate and higher operating expenses relative to sales. The increase in earnings from financial services was primarily attributable to increased net interest income, partially offset by increased expected loan loss provisions and higher insurance claims.\n\nThe U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.5 billion in 2023, a decrease of $170 million (2.2%) versus 2022. The decline reflected lower volumes and wholesale rates, as well as increased energy costs, partially offset by an increase in retail customer rates in certain territories. Retail customer volumes decreased 0.8% overall (down 0.8% at PacifiCorp and 2.6% at NV Energy and up 1.3% at MEC) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an overall unfavorable impact of weather, partially offset by increases in customer usage and the average number of customers.\n\nRailroad operating expenses were $15.9 billion in 2024, a decrease of $173 million (1.1%) compared to 2023. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 0.4 percentage points to 68.0% in 2024 versus 2023. Railroad compensation and benefits expenses increased $356 million (6.5%) in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $290 million charge related to a one-time payment included in the agreement with the SMART-TD labor union that was finalized in December 2024. This agreement allows BNSF the ability to redeploy brakepersons to conductors and engineers, which will allow BNSF to meet short-term hiring demands. Fuel expenses declined $417 million (11.3%) compared to 2023, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, partially offset by higher volumes. Railroad purchased services, equipment rents, materials and other expenses declined $126 million (3.0%), primarily due to cost reductions across numerous spend categories and lower property taxes, partially offset by a litigation charge in 2024 related to a judgment in an ongoing legal case with the Swinomish Tribe, which BNSF has appealed.\n\nClayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings declined $115 million (5.6%) in 2024 compared to 2023, attributable to lower earnings from financial services (4.4%) and manufacturing activities (9.4%). The decline in financial services earnings reflected increased losses from homeowner property insurance claims, increased expected loan loss provisions due to higher loan originations, higher interest expense on borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates. Interest expense increased $203 million (38%) in 2024 versus 2023, as borrowings from affiliates increased $6.6 billion in 2024 to $24.3 billion at December 31, 2024. The corresponding interest income on such borrowings is included in the “Other” earnings section on page K-54. The decline in manufacturing earnings was largely attributable to lower gross margin rates due to the increased cost of building homes to the Department of Energy’s Zero Energy Ready Home Program requirements (such incremental costs are partially offset by income tax credits).\n\nNet earnings of other energy businesses increased $310 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at Northern Powergrid, partially offset by lower earnings from the renewable energy business. The increase at Northern Powergrid was attributable to higher distribution revenue due to higher tariffs from inflation adjustments and lower income tax expense attributable to charges recognized in 2023 for the U.K. Energy Profits Levy and a group relief tax benefit recognized in 2024, partially offset by unfavorable results from the upstream gas exploration and production business and higher operating expenses. Earnings from the renewable energy business decreased mainly due to lower earnings from wind tax equity investments in 2024 and debt extinguishment gains recognized in 2023.\n\nAggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2023, a decrease of 10.0% versus 2022. The decline in revenues reflected overall lower sales volumes and changes in product mix, partly offset by higher average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $2.1 billion in 2023, a decrease of 11.4% compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 14.7% in 2023, a 0.3 percentage point decrease compared to 2022. The earnings decline in 2023 was driven by lower sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and losses from restructurings, plant closures and divestitures in 2023, partially offset by lower raw material costs and energy costs as well as reduced freight, shipping and utilities expenses.\n\nLubrizol’s revenues were $6.4 billion in 2023, a decline of 4.0% compared to 2022. The revenue decline was primarily due to a 7.9% decline in volumes and unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2023 were relatively unchanged compared to 2022. Earnings included insurance recoveries of $11 million in 2023 and $242 million in 2022 in connection with fires at the Rockton, Illinois facility in 2021 and the Rouen, France facility in 2019. Excluding insurance recoveries, earnings in 2023 increased due to the favorable impacts of higher selling prices, favorable changes in product mix and lower raw material costs, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and higher operating expenses.\n\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $4.5 billion (12.4%) in 2023. GEICO’s loss ratio declined 12.1 percentage points compared to 2022, reflecting the impact of higher average premiums per auto policy, lower property damage and collision claims frequencies and increased favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates, partially offset by increases in average claims severities across all significant coverages. Average claim severities increased for property damage (fourteen to sixteen percent range), collision (four to six percent range) and bodily injury (five to seven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior accident years’ claims of $1.5 billion in 2023 and $653 million in 2022.\n\nNet earnings of other energy businesses decreased $332 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The decline reflected lower earnings at Northern Powergrid due to unfavorable results from the upstream gas exploration and production business, including the write-off of capitalized exploration costs and lower gas production volumes and prices, as well as from higher deferred income tax expense related to the enactment of the U.K. Energy Profits Levy.
