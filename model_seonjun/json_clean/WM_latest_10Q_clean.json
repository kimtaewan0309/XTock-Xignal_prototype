We take proactive steps to recover and mitigate inflationary cost pressures through our overall pricing efforts and by managing our costs through efficiency, labor productivity and investments in technology to automate certain aspects of our business. We remain committed to putting our people first to ensure that they are well positioned to execute our daily operations diligently and safely. We remain focused on delivering outstanding customer service, managing our variable costs with changing volumes and investing in technology that will enhance our customers’ experience and provide operating efficiencies intended to reduce our cost to serve our customers.\nCurrent Quarter Financial Results\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, we continued to focus on our priorities to advance our strategy – enhancing employee engagement, permanently reducing our cost to serve our customers through the use of technology and automation, investing in growth through our Recycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy segments and integrating the Stericycle business. We continue to invest in our people through paying a competitive market wage, investing in our digital platform and providing training for our team members. We remain committed to our investment in recycling automation, which reduces costs and increases throughput, positioning us to overcome commodity price headwinds and deliver a differentiated service. As part of the integration of Stericycle, which constitutes our new WM Healthcare Solutions segment, we achieved synergies by reducing costs of duplicative business processes, established a performance management approach aimed at accountability and continued to improve customer engagement, billing and collection processes to deliver cash flow.\nKey elements of our financial results for the third quarter include:\nRevenues of $6,443 million, compared to $5,609 million in the prior year period, an increase of $834 million, or 14.9%. The increase is primarily attributable to (i) our recent acquisitions, particularly Stericycle; (ii) higher yield in our Collection and Disposal businesses and (iii) higher volumes primarily in our landfill, renewable energy, industrial collection and recycling businesses. The increase was partially offset by lower residential collection volumes and a reduction in single-stream and brokerage recycled commodity prices;\nOperating expenses of $3,833 million, or 59.5% of revenues, compared to $3,399 million, or 60.6% of revenues, in the prior year period. Despite the increase in operating expenses, efficiency gains, improved turnover and momentum in truck deliveries, combined with the benefit of price increases and high margin special waste volumes, positioned us to reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue when compared to the prior year period;\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $665 million, or 10.3% of revenues, compared to $525 million, or 9.4% of revenues, in the prior year period. The $140 million increase is primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions, particularly Stericycle, including consulting and technology costs incurred to support Stericycle’s integration;\nIncome from operations was $989 million, or 15.3% of revenues, compared to $1,119 million, or 20.0% of revenues, in the prior year period. The $130 million decrease is primarily attributable to (i) a $152 million charge related to the decision to temporarily suspend the operations of a business engaged in accelerating plastic film and wrap recycling capabilities resulting from significant deterioration of market pricing and demand for post-consumer plastics; (ii) higher depreciation and amortization costs and integration-related expenses arising from our Stericycle acquisition; (iii) a $45 million impairment charge related to the decision to accelerate the closure of a landfill within our East Tier and (iv) an $11 million negotiated payment for early termination of a contract in our WM Renewable Energy segment. These reductions were partially offset by growth in our Collection and Disposal businesses and declines in annual incentive compensation and employee benefit expenses;\nNet income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. was $603 million, or $1.49 per diluted share, compared to $760 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, in the prior year period. The $157 million decrease was primarily driven\n\nOur overall pricing efforts are focused on keeping pace with the increasing costs and capital intensity of our business. We continue to see yield growth in our landfill business primarily driven by municipal solid waste, which achieved average yield of 6.7% and 6.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.\nRecycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy\n— Recycling Processing and Sales revenues attributable to yield decreased $72 million and $113 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. Average market prices for single-stream recycled commodities declined nearly 35% and 15% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. Revenues attributable to yield in our WM Renewable Energy segment decreased $2 million and increased $14 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. Year-to-date increases in natural gas and electricity pricing were partially offset by declines in RINs pricing. While there may be short-term fluctuations in our commodity-driven businesses as prices change, we continue to take proactive steps to adjust our business models to protect against the downside risk of changes in commodity prices.\nEnergy Surcharge and Mandated Fees —\nThese fees increased $12 million and $19 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the prior year periods, mandated fees increased $4 million and $29 million, respectively. Fluctuations in energy surcharges drove an increase of $8 million for the quarter to date period and a decrease of $10 million for the year to date period. The mandated fees are primarily related to fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations, particularly in our West Tier.\nOur revenues from volume (excluding volumes from acquisitions and divestitures) increased $43 million and $166 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, volume growth was led by our landfill business, with increases in municipal solid waste and special waste. Industrial collection volumes rose for the first time since 2022, and growth projects drove gains in our WM Renewable Energy and Recycling Processing and Sales segments. These gains were partially offset by a decline in residential collection volumes, reflecting our strategic exit from lower-margin contracts. In addition to the growth in the quarter, the year-to-date period benefited from elevated special waste volumes in the West Tier driven by wildfire clean-up efforts that were completed by August 2025, and an increase in Strategic Business Solutions volumes due to our differentiated service model. These gains were also partially offset by a decline in residential collection volumes, reflecting our strategic exit from lower-margin contracts.\n\n— The increase in subcontractor costs was primarily due to additional costs incurred as a part of our recent acquisitions and continued inflationary cost pressures, particularly labor costs from third-party haulers.\n— The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by a 35% and 15% decrease in average market prices for single-stream recycled commodities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. This decrease was partially offset by additional pipeline transportation costs attributable to new RNG facilities brought on-line since the prior year periods.\n— The increase in fuel costs was primarily due to our recent acquisitions and the expiration of the federal alternative fuel tax credit on December 31, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the increase was partially offset by declines in diesel prices.\nDisposal and Franchise Fees and Taxes\n— The increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes was primarily driven by increased landfill volumes and an overall rate increase in fees and taxes paid to municipalities on our disposal volumes.\nLandfill Operating Costs\n— The increase in landfill operating costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the prior year periods, was primarily due to an increase in volumes and higher leachate treatment costs in our West Tier. Partially offsetting the increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were certain adjustments to increase our environmental remediation reserve during the first quarter of 2024.\n— Risk management costs decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an insurance recovery associated with a 2022 transfer station fire and improved claims experience. These reductions were offset, in part, by additional claims and premiums attributable to our recent acquisitions, particularly Stericycle.\n\nVariability in economic conditi"
