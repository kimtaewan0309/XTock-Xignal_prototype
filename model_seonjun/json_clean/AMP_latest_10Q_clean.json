Clients may hold non-advisory investments in their wrap accounts that do not incur an advisory fee.\nAverage advisory wrap account assets are calculated using an average of the prior period’s ending balance and all months in the current period excluding the most recent month for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, which is reflective of our billing cycle.\nEnding wrap account assets increased $35.1 billion to $650.3 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2025 due to market appreciation of $30.3 billion and net inflows of $4.8 billion.

After a period of strong growth during a rising interest rate environment, ACC has experienced net outflows during the past seven quarters. Third party cash products increased $5.0 billion to $47.9 billion driven by an increase of money market funds of $7.2 billion, partially offset by a decline in brokered CDs.\nThe following table presents assets supporting Ameriprise Bank deposits and ACC certificates as of September 30:\nACC\nFixed and adjustable rate\nTotal Available-for-Sale securities\nCash and cash equivalents\nLoans and other assets\nTotal assets supporting deposits or certificates\nPresented on an amortized cost basis.\nIn Ameriprise Bank, assets included $19.4 billion of Available-for-Sale securities, $3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $1.7 billion of other assets, primarily loans. The Ameriprise Bank investment portfolio securities are mostly rated AAA and primarily consist of structured assets, of which 11% were floating rate and sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates as of September 30, 2025. We took action to reduce the floating rate allocation from 19% as of September 30, 2024. The duration of Ameriprise Bank investments was 3.7 years as of September 30, 2025 compared to 3.1 years as of September 30, 2024.

This reflected the benefit from market appreciation and increased advisor productivity through the cumulative impact of client net inflows, partially offset by lower interest revenue.

Peer groupings of Threadneedle funds are defined by either IA or Morningstar index and are based on the Primary Share Class. Comparison to Index are measured gross of fees.\nTo calculate asset weighted performance, the sum of the total assets of the funds with above median ranking are divided by total assets of all funds. Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.\nAggregated Asset Allocation Funds may include funds that invest in other Columbia or Threadneedle branded mutual funds included in both equity and fixed income.\nColumbia funds are available for purchase by U.S. customers. Out of 89 Columbia funds rated (based on primary share class), 1 received a 5-star Overall Rating and 46 received a 4-star Overall Rating. Out of 134 Threadneedle funds rated (based on highest-rated share class), 11 received a 5-star Overall Rating and 46 received a 4-star Overall Rating. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.\nThe following table presents global managed assets by type:\nTotal managed as"
