Changes in our merchandise or channel mix may also have an impact on cost of sales. This presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include:\npayroll, bonus, and benefit costs for retail store and corporate employees;\nadvertising and marketing costs, offset by vendor income that is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs;\noccupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities;\nstock-based compensation expense;\ndepreciation and amortization for all assets, except those related to our retail stores and distribution operations, which are included in cost of sales; and\nlegal, finance, information systems, and other corporate overhead costs.\nThis presentation of items in selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses.\nPre-opening expenses include non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new, remodeled, and relocated stores including rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores, store set-up labor, management and employee training, and grand opening advertising.\nInterest income represents interest from cash equivalents, which include highly liquid investments such as money market funds and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense includes interest costs and facility fees associated with our credit facilities, which is structured as an asset-based lending instrument. Interest on our credit facilities is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising or elevated interest rates.\nIncome tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores.\nResults of operations\nOur quarterly periods are the 13 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. The Company’s second quarter in fiscal 2025 and 2024 ended on August 2, 2025 and August 3, 2024, respectively. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\n\nmerchandise margin, increase operating efficiencies, and grow other revenue, partially offset by incremental investments in new stores and technology to enhance the guest experience, people, assortment, and advertising.\nThe overall beauty market expanded in 2024 and into the second quarter of 2025, supported by on-going consumer engagement with the beauty category. We remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model, our commitment to strategic investments, and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains over the long term.\nImpact of inflation and other macroeconomic trends\n\nPersistent inflationary and macroeconomic pressures, including existing and potential tariffs, have impacted consumer spending habits broadly, which we believe could contribute to lower sales trends throughout fiscal 2025. The continuation of inflationary and macroeconomic pressures, including existing and potential tariffs, could further impact our ability to grow sales and maintain historical profitability levels. In addition, inflation could cause the interest rates on any debt to remain at an elevated level or increase.\nBasis of presentation\nThe Company has one reportable segment, which includes retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce.\nWe recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores. E-commerce sales are recognized upon shipment or guest pickup of the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria. Retail store and e-commerce sales are recorded net of estimated returns. Shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup. We provide refunds for merchandise returns within 30 days from the original purchase date. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider our self a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting state sales tax. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. Gift card sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Other revenue includes the private label and co-branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target Corporation, and deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.\nComparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation. Therefore, a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one-month grand opening period. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period. Comparable sales include retail sales, salon services, and e-commerce.
