  "item1_clean": "We intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services that we provide across the drug discovery and non-clinical development continuum primarily through internal development, and also, through focused acquisitions and our strategic partnerships strategy, all of which are intended to enable us with the flexibility to adapt and innovate to meet our client’s changing needs. Acquisitions, such as our acquisitions of Explora BioLabs in fiscal 2022, SAMDI in 2023, and Noveprim in 2023, have been (and we expect will be in the future) an integral part of our growth strategy, both to expand our portfolio and broaden our geographic footprint. We are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit. We aim to consistently deliver shareholder value, including the achievement of a hurdle rate for return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital.\nMergers and acquisitions remain one of our top, long-term priorities for disciplined capital deployment and enhancing growth strategy with focus on enhancing the breadth of our scientific capabilities principally within our core competencies, expanding our global scale, and maintaining our leadership position in advanced and emerging therapies. Our long-term strategy also includes growth through establishing relationships and exploring other opportunities and areas that have the potential to strengthen our broad-based portfolio of products and services.\nWe also partner with a diverse set of leading venture capital firms around the world primarily investing in life sciences, health care and therapeutics with an emphasis on early-stage companies. Through these partnerships and close relationships, we gain insight into their company and asset portfolios and are thus able to promote our services for each of our businesses. We also view these partnerships as an investment in new and emerging sciences and technologies as they allow us to gain insights to cutting-edge capabilities. Thus, we have the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group that has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines.\nWe routinely evaluate strategic fit and fundamental performance of our businesses. As part of this ongoing assessment, we may determine certain capital could be better deployed in other long-term growth opportunities. Most recently, we divested our Avian Vaccine Services business in 2022, and a Safety Assessment site in 2024, as we determined these businesses/sites were no longer a strategic fit.\nOur clients consist primarily of major biopharmaceutical companies; many small, emerging, and established biotechnology, agricultural and industrial chemical, life science, veterinary medicine, medical device, diagnostic and consumer product companies; contract research and contract manufacturing organizations; and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. We have stable, long-term relationships with many of our clients. During 2024, no single client accounted for more than 4% of our total revenue and no single client accounted for more than 8% of the revenue of any of our three business segments.\nSales, Marketing and Customer Support\nOur marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire services portfolio. We believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of early-stage drug research are increasingly attractive to our clients, and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible, customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients’ global and site-specific needs.\nOur go-to-market approach employs a number of sales and marketing strategies, including dedicated sales teams for each of our major lines of business and global and key account managers who represent the entire portfolio. We also maintain several sales specialists that either have specific technical expertise (often degreed scientists) or cover unique markets.\nIn addition to our field sales teams and related specialists, we also have a team of alliance managers who are organized by key client within our market segments (global biopharmaceutical, small and mid-sized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic and government institutions). This enhances our ability to meet client needs by offering customized,\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\ntailored solutions across our entire portfolio. In addition, our clients benefit by additional support from a combination of technical specialists with specific scientific and therapeutic area expertise. We also apply the use of dedicated sales specialists for certain technical product lines, such as in our Manufacturing businesses.\nWe sell our products and services principally through our direct sales and business development teams who work in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition to interactions with our direct sales force, our primary promotional activities include presenting scientific symposia to targeted audiences, publishing scientific papers, technical support pieces and white papers, and newsletters, hosting webinars and virtual seminars and making presentations at, and participating in, scientific conferences and trade shows in North America, Europe and Asia. We supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with digital marketing, advertising and website content. In certain areas, our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents.\nOur internal strategic marketing and marketing operations teams support the field sales and business development teams while developing and implementing programs to build awareness about products and services and create opportunities for interaction with our clients in the biomedical research industry. We maintain client engagement, lead development support, digital experience, eCommerce, and event management departments, which address both our clients’ routine and more specialized needs and purposely serve as a scientific support and information resource for them. We frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to resourcing products and services, research support, non-clinical study design, regulatory consulting, protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients.\nOur goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate. We compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in early-stage drug research, quality, reputation, flexibility, responsiveness, pricing, innovation and global capabilities. We are able to offer a unique portfolio of early-stage products and services to support drug discovery and development.\nWe encounter a broad range of competitors of different sizes and capabilities in each of our three businesses segments. We also face competition from the internal discovery and development resources of our clients.\nFor RMS, we have four main competitors of which one is a government funded, not-for-profit entity; one is a public company in the U.S.; one is privately held in Europe; and one is privately held in the U.S.\nFor DSA, both our discovery services and safety assessment services have numerous competitors. Our discovery services offerings have hundreds of competitors, but two main competitors: one is a public company in China and one is a public company in Europe. Our safety assessment offerings have dozens of competitors of varying size, but one main competitor that is a division of a large public company in the U.S. Our DSA segment also competes with in-house departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and teaching hospitals.\nFor Manufacturing, each of our underlying businesses has several competitors. Microbial Solutions has four main competitors, of which three are public companies in Europe and one is part of a public company in Japan. In addition to many smaller competitors, Biologics Solutions has five main competitors, of which three are public companies in Europe, one is a public company in the U.S., and one is a public company in China.\nIndustry Support and Animal Welfare\nOne of our core values is a commitment to animal welfare. Research animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery and development of life-saving drugs. We work with our scientific community peers to understand how living conditions, handling procedures, and experimental procedures contribute to animal stress and play a role in the quality of research outcomes. As researchers, we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well-being of the animals in our care, and prioritize the humane treatment of these critically important research models.\nWe have been at the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business. We created our own Humane Care Imperative (HCI), which is overseen by our Global Animal Welfare and Training corporate group. The goal of HCI is to ensure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of research animals and implementation of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement). As part of the HCI, we also have quarterly recognition and celebration of employees that go above and beyond to promote animal welfare and safety, In 2024, we published on our website an extensive and comprehensive Corporate Citizenship Report, which includes information on our Global Animal Welfare and Training, Responsible Animal Use and New Alternative Methodologies (NAMs) work, including investments in NAMs through our recently launched Alternative Methods Advancement Project (AMAP) initiative that is dedicated to investing in and developing alternatives to reduce animal testing.\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nWe are firmly committed to the 3Rs and to reducing the number of animals that we work with by emphasizing health, research animal behavioral management programs and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability. Whenever possible, we use low stress handling of our animals, technological advances such as\ndiagnostic tests for health surveillance in laboratory rodents, microsampling and various\nassays. We support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare and the 3Rs, as well as the interests of the biomedical research community. We also partner with clients to develop study designs to right-size the number of animals needed and suggest pilot studies where appropriate. We maintain a quarterly award program that recognizes our employees’ efforts to continually implement the 3Rs at our sites globally.\nWe provide scholarships for training in laboratory animal science, financial support to non-profit organizations that promote and educate the public about animal welfare, the 3Rs, and the benefits of animal research, and awards to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal science field and the supporters of 3Rs.\nIn 2023, our Board of Directors established a Responsible Animal Use Committee to assist the Company in improving our impact on responsible animal utilization, including evaluating and advising scientific and technological opportunities which may appropriately reduce the impact of animals in the Company’s operations. Additionally, in March 2024 we published our first annual report to shareholders on the measures the Company takes to reinforce confidence that the NHPs we import are sourced in accordance with applicable laws.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 28, 2024, we had approximately 20,100 e",
  "item7_clean": "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is or may be material. We believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer (“transaction price”).\nTo the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the amount to which we expect to be entitled. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. Sales, value add, and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue.\nWhen determining the transaction price of a contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. Generally, we do not extend payment terms beyond one year. Applying the practical expedient, we do not assess whether a significant financing\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\ncomponent exists if the period between when we perform our obligations under the contract and when the customer pays is one year or less. Our contracts do not generally contain significant financing components.\nContracts with customers may contain multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation. We determine standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. Contract modifications exist when the modification either creates new, or changes existing, enforceable rights and obligations. Generally, when contract modifications create new performance obligations, the modification is considered to be a separate contract and revenue is recognized prospectively. When contract modifications change existing performance obligations, the impact on the existing transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is generally recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis.\nProduct revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract. Service revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are delivered to the customer based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. Depending on which better depicts the transfer of value to the customer, we generally measure our progress using either cost-to-cost (input method) or right-to-invoice (output method). We use the cost-to-cost measure of progress when it best depicts the transfer of value to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contract, generally related to fixed fee service contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. The costs calculation includes variables such as labor hours, allocation of overhead costs, research model costs, and subcontractor costs. Revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. The right-to-invoice measure of progress is generally related to rate per unit contracts, as the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on discrete service or time-based increments, such as samples tested or labor hours incurred. Revenue is recorded in the amount invoiced since that amount corresponds directly to the value of our performance to date. During fiscal year 2024, $2.4 billion, or approximately 60%, of our total revenue recognized ($4.0 billion) is DSA service and product revenue transferred over time.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets (including goodwill) and certain biological assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in certain recent acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such assets are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the asset will be amortized. We utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income, cost and market approaches, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of these assets. Typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from these assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.\nIn our recent acquisitions, customer relationship intangible assets (also referred to as client relationships) and certain biological assets have been the most significant identifiable assets acquired. To determine the fair value of the acquired client relationships and biological assets, we utilized the multiple period excess earnings model (a commonly accepted valuation technique), which includes the following key assumptions: projections of cash flows from the acquired entities, which included future revenue, cost of revenue, operating income margins, customer attrition rates, productivity rates; as well as discount rates based on a market participant’s weighted average cost of capital. During fiscal year 2024, we did not enter into any acquisitions. The value of the client relationship acquired was $23 million and the value of the biological assets acquired was $168 million for fiscal year 2023.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include, but are not limited to, unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key customers or personnel, and acts by governments and courts. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment.\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nWe perform the quantitative impairment test where we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. If the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023 we performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. Fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a market-based approach and an income approach, as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the market-based approach, we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.\nDuring the third quarter ended September 28, 2024, a triggering event was identified for the Discovery Services reporting unit (part of the DSA reportable segment). This resulted from a continuous decline in market conditions and operational challenges, ultimately resulting in a reduction of Discovery Services’ long range financial outlook. In response, we conducted a quantitative impairment test for goodwill to determine if the goodwill in the Discovery Services reporting unit was impaired. Upon completion of a quantitative impairment test, it was determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 22%, and no impairment was recognized as of September 28, 2024. As of the annual impairment test date, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16% and no impairment was recognized as of December 28, 2024. While the Discovery Services reporting unit is not currently impaired, we will continue to closely monitor future performance and any potential impacts on the value of the reporting unit. If the estimated future cash flows decrease below our current expectations, specifically as a result of lower revenue growth rates or lower operating income margins, or due to an increase of the weighted-average cost of capital, the fair value may decrease below the carrying value, which may result in a material goodwill impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2024, a triggering event was identified for the Biologics Solutions reporting unit after the annual impairment assessment. This resulted from a loss of key customers, ultimately resulting in a reduction in Biologics Solutions’ long range financial outlook. In response, we conducted a quantitative impairment test for goodwill to determine if the goodwill in the Biologics Solutions reporting unit was impaired. The fair value of the Biologics Solutions reporting unit tested for impairment during 2024 was determined based on a discounted cash flow model (an income approach) and earnings multiples (a market approach) based on the guideline public company method. Significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value of the Biologics Solutions reporting unit generally include forecasted cash flows, discount rates, terminal growth rates and earnings multiples. The discounted cash flow model used to determine the fair value of the Biologics Solutions reporting unit as of the impairment triggering date reflected assumptions related to revenue growth rates, operating income margins, discount rate and terminal growth rate. The Biologics Solutions reporting unit fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they involve significant unobservable inputs.\nUpon completion of a quantitative impairment test, it was determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment of approximately $215.0 million. We will continue to closely monitor future performance and any potential impacts on the value of the reporting unit. If the estimated future cash flows decrease below our current expectations, specifically as a result of lower revenue growth rates or operating income margins, or due to an increase of the weighted-average cost of capital, the fair value may further decrease resulting in an incremental material goodwill impairment.\nOur 2024 and 2023 impairment tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any other reporting units.\nValuation and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets to be held and used, principally definite-lived intangible assets, biological assets, right-of-use lease assets, and property, plant, and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:\nsignificant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;\nloss of key customers;\nsignificant negative industry or economic trends; or\nsignificant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long-lived assets.\nDetermination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group, net of any sublease income, if applicable, and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. We\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nmeasure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows, including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. We may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets, as appropriate. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.\nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2024, a triggering event was identified for the Cell Therapy asset group within the Biologics Solutions business as there was a loss of key customers, resulting in a significant reduction in cash flows. We concluded there were no impairments for the asset group related to this triggering event, however the remaining useful life of the intangible asset within the asset group was reduced to less than 1 year.\nLong-lived asset impairments associated with our right-of-use lease assets and property, plant, and equipment, recognized during fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were $51.8 million and $41.9 million, respectively.\nWe prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our",
