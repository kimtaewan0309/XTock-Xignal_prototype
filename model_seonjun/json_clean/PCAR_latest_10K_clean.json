  "item7_clean": "Truck sales volume decreased revenues by $2,107.6 million and costs by $1,650.0 million, primarily reflecting lower truck deliveries in Europe and the U.S. and Canada, partially offset by higher truck deliveries in Mexico and Brasil.\nAverage truck sales prices increased sales by $155.6 million from modest price realization, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, Mexico and Australia.\nAverage cost per truck increased cost of sales by $557.1 million, primarily reflecting higher raw material and labor costs, partially offset by lower warranty costs.\nFactory overhead and other indirect costs increased $18.6 million, primarily due to higher labor costs, primarily offset by lower utilities costs and factory supplies.\nExtended warranties, operating leases and other increased revenues by $61.5 million primarily due to higher volume of repair and maintenance (R&M) contracts, extended warranty and dealer support services. The increase in cost of sales by $106.3 million reflects higher costs from extended warranty, R&M contracts, dealer support services and lower used truck results.\nThe currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales primarily reflects a decline in the value of the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the increase in value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar.\nTruck gross margin was 13.9% in 2024 compared to 16.4% in 2023 due to the factors noted above.\nTruck selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2024 decreased to $254.2 million from $278.5 million in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and marketing expenses and professional expenses. As a percentage of sales, Truck SG&A was 1.0% in 2024 and 1.0% in 2023.\n\nAftermarket parts sales volume increased by $89.8 million and related cost of sales increased by $81.2 million, primarily reflecting higher sales volume in all markets except the U.S. and Canada.\nAverage aftermarket parts sales prices increased sales by $161.6 million, primarily due to price realization in Europe and the U.S. and Canada.\nAverage aftermarket parts direct costs increased $143.9 million due to higher material costs, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, and higher delivery costs.\nWarehouse and other indirect costs increased $14.2 million primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses.\nThe currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales primarily reflects a decrease in the value of the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar.\nParts gross margin was 30.9% in 2024 compared to 31.9% in 2023 due to the factors noted above.\nParts SG&A expense in 2024 increased to $246.4 million from $238.0 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs. As a percentage of sales, Parts SG&A was 3.7% in 2024 and 3.7% in 2023.\n\nProduct warranty, including changes in estimates for pre-existing warranties, is disclosed in Note I of the consolidated financial statements. The expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims, net of recoveries. Estimates consider product type, geographical differences, labor rates, and any other known factors affecting the number or amount of expected claim payments. For new products with no historical experience, reference to similar products is utilized. Management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through quality-improvement programs; however, actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve. Historically those adjustments have not been material. Over the past two years, warranty expense as a percentage of Truck, Parts and Other net sales and revenues has ranged between 2.5% and 2.9%. If the 2024 warranty expense had been .2% higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2024, warranty expense would have increased by approximately $63 million.\n\nFinancial Services Outlook\nIn 2025, average earning assets are expected to be comparable to 2024. The used truck market has normalized in North America, but remains soft in Europe. If freight transportation conditions decline due to a weaker economy, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current levels and new business volume would likely decline.\nCapital Investments and R&D Outlook\nPACCAR's excellent long-term profits, strong balance sheet and consistent focus on quality have enabled the Company to invest $8.6 billion in new and expanded facilities, innovative products and new technologies during the past decade. Capital investments in 2025 are expected to be $700 to $800 million, and R&D is expected to be $460 to $500 million. PACCAR is investing in its truck factories, including expansions at Kenworth Chillicothe, Ohio, PACCAR Mexico, and the DAF truck assembly plant in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Investments in PACCAR's global engine business include additional manufacturing and remanufacturing capacity. In addition to the capital and R&D investments, the Company expects to invest another $400 to $700 million in its battery joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies.\nSee the Forward-Looking Statements section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis for factors that may affect these outlooks.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:\n\nPFS income before income taxes by $8.7 million in 2024, primarily due to a decrease in the value of the Brazilian real and Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar.\nIncluded in Financial Services, Other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of $396.5 million at December 31, 2024 and $309.8 million at December 31, 2023. These trucks are primarily units returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and also include trucks acquired from repossessions, through acquisitions of used trucks in trades related to new truck sales and trucks returned from residual value guarantees (RVGs).\nThe Company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of $59.0 million in 2024 compared to gains of $43.5 million in 2023, including $40.3 million of losses on multiple unit transactions in 2024 compared to $12.3 million in 2023. Used truck losses related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were $9.8 million in 2024 and $4.6 million in 2023.\nThe major factors for the changes in interest and fees, interest and other borrowing expenses and finance margin between 2024 and 2023 are outlined below:\n\nIncluded in Other is the Company’s industrial winch manufacturing business through October 31, 2024, as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment. Other also includes non-service cost components of pension expense and a portion of corporate expense. Other sales represent less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2024 and 2023. Other SG&A decreased to $84.4 million in 2024 from $87.8 million in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in professional fees partially offset by higher salaries and related expenses.\nOther income before tax was $13.5 million in 2024 compared to a loss of $616.8 million in 2023, primarily due to the EC-related charge in the first quarter 2023 which is discussed in Note L of the consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment income increased to $394.7 million in 2024 from $292.2 million in 2023, primarily due to higher average investment balances in all regions as well as higher investment yields due to higher market interest rates, primarily in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn 2024, the effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 19.5% in 2023. The lower effective tax rate in 2023 was primarily due to a $119.7 million discrete tax benefit for the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Brasil. Also included in 2023 was the EC-related charge of $600.0 million, which lowered the effective tax rate in 2023.\n\nHigher sales volume, partially offset by lower market prices of used truck on trade, increased revenues by $72.2 million and related depreciation and other expenses by $74.0 million.\nResults on returned lease assets increased depreciation and other expenses by $99.7 million, primarily due to losses on sale of returned lease units in 2024 (compared to gains in 2023) and impairment on existing used truck inventories, mainly in Europe, as a result of lower used truck market values.\nAverage operating lease assets decreased $365.9 million (excluding foreign exchange effects), which decreased revenues by $148.2 million and related depreciation and other expenses by $132.1 million.\nRevenue per asset increased $78.2 million primarily due to higher average truck values financed. Cost per asset increased $85.1 million due to higher depreciation and operating expenses, mainly in Europe.\n\n2024 Financial Highlights\nWorldwide net sales and revenues were $33.66 billion in 2024 compared to $35.13 billion in 2023, primarily due to lower truck revenues, partially offset by higher parts and financial services revenues.\nTruck sales were $24.84 billion in 2024 compared to $26.85 billion in 2023 from lower revenues in Europe and the U.S. and Canada.\nParts sales were $6.67 billion in 2024 compared to $6.41 billion in 2023, reflecting higher price realization in all markets.\nFinancial Services revenues were $2.10 billion in 2024 compared to $1.81 billion in 2023, primarily due to portfolio growth and higher portfolio yields.\nIn 2024, PACCAR earned net income for the 86\nconsecutive year. Net income was $4.16 billion ($7.90 per diluted share) in 2024 compared to $4.60 billion ($8.76 per diluted share) in 2023.\nAfter-tax return on beginning equity (ROE) was 26.2% in 2024 compared to 34.9% in 2023. Equity increased 10.3% from $15.88 billion in 2023 to a record $17.51 billion in 2024.\nCapital investments were $795.8 million in 2024 compared to $698.3 million in 2023.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $452.9 million in 2024 compared to $410.9 million in 2023.\nPACCAR opened its new, 240,000 square-foot Parts Distribution Center (PDC) in Massbach, Germany, in November 2024. This PDC supports DAF’s growth in Germany, Europe’s largest truck market, by enhancing parts delivery to dealers and customers.\n\nOperating activities:\nCash provided by operations increased by $450.9 million to $4.64 billion in 2024 from $4.19 billion in 2023. The increased operating cash flow reflects lower net income of $438.8 million, $241.5 million higher cash provided from net income items not affecting cash, primarily deferred income taxes and the provision for losses on financial services receivables, and lower cash usage from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $661.7 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities are mainly due to higher cash provided by net changes in operating assets, primarily wholesale receivables on new trucks in the Financial Services segment of $787.7 million, trade and other receivables of $587.6 million and lower cash usage of $393.2 million for inventories, partially offset by decrease in accruals of $1,084.7 million, including the EC-related charge and product support liabilities.\nInvesting activities:\nCash used in investing activities increased by $1.62 billion to $4.49 billion in 2024 from $2.87 billion in 2023. The increase in net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects increased purchases of marketable securities, net of proceeds from sales and maturities, of $801.9 million, a higher net increase in wholesale receivables on equipment of $483.0 million, increased acquisition of equipment on operating leases of $339.4 million and cash contributed to the battery manufacturing joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies, of $207.6 million. Increased cash used in investing activities was partially offset by cash received from the sale of PACCAR Winch Inc.\nFinancing activities:\nCash used in financing activities was $123.1 million in 2024 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1.10 billion in 2023, reflecting higher cash dividends and lower net borrowing activity. The Company paid $2.29 billion in dividends in 2024 compared to $1.52 billion in 2023, primarily due to a higher year-end dividend paid in January 2024. Cash provided from net borrowing activities was $2.12 billion, $454.8 million lower than the cash provided by net borrowing activities of $2.57 billion in 2023.\n\nThe Company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. A projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the Company’s borrowers and their ability to repay. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for changes in forecasted economic conditions that are specific to the industry and markets in which the Company conducts business. The Company utilizes economic forecasts from third-party sources and determines expected losses based on historical experience under similar market conditions. After determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of expected credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio.\nThe adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current and future market conditions. As accounts become past due, the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases. The Company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 10% and 80%. Over the past two years, the Company’s year-end 30+ days past due accounts have ranged between 1.0% and 1.3% of loan and lease receivables. Historically, a 100 basis point increase in the 30+ days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 1 to 25\n\n* Amortized cost basis immediately after modification as a percentage of the year-end retail portfolio balance.\nModification activity increased to $994.5 million in 2024 from $487.8 million in 2023. The increase in modifications for commercial reasons primarily reflects higher volumes of refinancing. The decrease related to Insignificant delay modifications reflects a decrease in customers requesting payment relief for up to three months, primarily in the U.S., partially offset by an increase in customers requesting payment relief for up to three months in Brasil. The increase in Credit modifications reflects higher volumes of contract modifications in the U.S. The higher Credit modification in the U.S. is mainly due to two large fleet customers that were granted a weighted average of five months term extension in 2024. These customers were not past due at the time of modification and at December 31, 2024.\n\nITEM 7.
