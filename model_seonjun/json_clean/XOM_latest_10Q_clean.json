MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the price of crude oil increased slightly relative to second quarter 2025, remaining near the middle of the 10-year historical range (2010-2019) supported by strong demand despite increased OPEC+ supply. Natural gas prices remained at the top of the 10-year range on robust global demand. Global industry refining margins moved toward the top of the 10-year historical range in the third quarter, impacted by industry supply outages coupled with strong demand. Chemical margins remained at bottom of cycle, well below the 10-year range, with continued industry oversupply.\nDuring 2025, the U.S. announced a variety of trade-related actions, including the imposition of tariffs on imports from several countries. In response, many countries announced their own retaliatory tariffs. Despite the current uncertainty as to what effects these actions will ultimately have on the Corporation, our suppliers and our customers, as well as on the overall macroeconomic environment, we do not anticipate any material near-term financial impacts.\nSelected Earnings Driver Definitions\nThe earnings drivers provide additional visibility into our business results. The Corporation evaluates these drivers periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market. Listed below are descriptions of the earnings drivers:\nAdvantaged Volume Growth.\nRepresents earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, advantaged projects, and high-value products.\nAdvantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects).\nIncludes Permian, Guyana, and LNG.\nAdvantaged Projects.\nIncludes capital projects and programs of work that contribute to Energy, Chemical, and/or Specialty Products segments that drive integration of segments/businesses, increase yield of higher value products, or deliver higher than average returns.\nHigh-Value Products.\nIncludes performance products and lower-emission fuels. Performance products (performance chemicals, performance lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users.\nLower-emission fuels refers to fuels with lower life cycle emissions than conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.\nRepresents all volume/mix drivers not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.\nStructural Cost Savings.\nRepresents after-tax earnings effects of Structural Cost Savings as defined on\n, including cash operating expenses related to divestments.\nRepresents all expenses otherwise not included in other earnings drivers.\nRepresents timing effects that are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).\nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items\nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items are earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individual segment may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several segments or several periods. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items does include non-operational earnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for Identified Items. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends, and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nCorporate and Financing\n(millions of dollars)\nU.S.\nU.S.\nU.S.\nU.S.\nEarnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)\n\nBecause of the ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.\nCash flow from operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2025 was $14.9 billion, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the comparable 2024 period.\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $39.3 billion for the first nine months of 2025, $3.5 billion lower than 2024. Net income including noncontrolling interests was $23.2 billion, a decrease of $4.0 billion from the prior year period. The adjustment for the noncash provision of $18.3 billion for depreciation and depletion was up $1.4 billion from 2024. Changes in operational working capital were a reduction of $5.0 billion during the period. All other items net increased cash flows by $2.9 billion in 2025 versus a decrease of $0.9 billion in 2024. See the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for additional details.\nInvesting activities for the first nine months of 2025 used net cash of $18.8 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion compared to the prior year. Spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $20.9 billion was $3.4 billion higher than 2024. Proceeds from asset sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion compared to the prior year. Net investments and advances decreased $0.7 billion from $0.7 billion in 2024.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $30.3 billion in the first nine months of 2025, including $14.9 billion for the purchase of 136 million shares of ExxonMobil stock, as part of the previously announced buyback program. This compares to net cash used in financing activities of $31.6 billion in the prior year. Total debt at the end of the third quarter of 2025 was $42.0 billion compared to $41.7 billion at year-end 2024. The Corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 13.5 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2025 compared to 13.4 percent at year-end 2024. The net debt to capital ratio\nwas 9.5 percent at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 3.0 percentage points from year-end 2024. The Corporation's capital allocation priorities are investing in competitively advantaged, high-return projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and sharing our success with our shareholders through more consistent share repurchases and a growing dividend. The Corporation distributed a total of $12.9 billion to shareholders in the first nine months of 2025 through dividends.\nThe Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. Commercial paper is used to balance short-term liquidity requirements and is reflected in \"Notes and loans payable\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in outstanding commercial paper between periods included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term committed lines of credit of $0.4 billion as of the end of third quarter 2025. On October 2, 2025, the Corporation established a 364-day revolving credit facility of $7.0 billion to provide short-term borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes.\nNet debt is total debt of $42.0 billion less $13.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash . Net debt to capital ratio is net debt divided by net debt plus total equity of $268.2 billion. Total debt is the sum of notes and loans payable and long-term debt, as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include strategic fit, cost synergies, potential for future growth, low cost of supply, and attractive valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.\nLitigation and other contingencies are discussed in\nto the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition. Through the third quarter of 2025, the Corporation entered into a long-term purchase agreement with an estimated total obligation of approximately $2.3 billion.\nTAXES\n(millions of dollars)\nEffective income tax rate\nTotal other taxes and duties\n\nIncludes “Other taxes and duties” plus taxes that are included in “Production and manufacturing expenses” and “Selli\nng, general and administrative expenses”, each from the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nTotal taxes were $10.5 billion for the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $1.2 billion from 2024.
