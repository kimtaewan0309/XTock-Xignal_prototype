Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide information that will assist the reader in understanding the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements between select periods and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. In addition, we discuss how certain accounting principles, policies and critical estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our discussion also contains certain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations as well as a discussion of the many factors that we believe may have an impact on our business on an ongoing basis. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the company’s business under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the\nHighlights for the third quarter of 2025 include:\nTotal sales and revenues for the third quarter of 2025 were $17.638 billion, an increase of $1.532 billion, or 10 percent, compared with $16.106 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Sales were higher across the three primary segments.\nOperating profit margin was 17.3 percent for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 19.5 percent for the third quarter of 2024.\nAdjusted operating profit margin\nwas 17.5 percent for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 20.0 percent for the third quarter of 2024.\nThird-quarter 2025 profit per share was $4.88, and excluding the items in the table below,\nadjusted profit per share\nwas $4.95. Third-quarter 2024 profit per share was $5.06, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $5.17.\nCaterpillar ended the third quarter of 2025 with $7.5 billion of enterprise cash.\nHighlights for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, include:\nTotal sales and revenues were $48.456 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $138 million, compared with $48.594 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOperating profit margin was 17.5 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with 20.9 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Adjusted operating profit margin was 17.8 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with 21.5 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nProfit per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was $13.69, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $13.91. Profit per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $16.27, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $16.75.\nEnterprise operating cash flow was $8.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nIn order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers, we have separately quantified the impact of significant items.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\n(Dollars in millions except per share data)\n\nInformation related to legal proceedings appears in Note 14 – \"Environmental and legal matters\" of Part I, Item 1 “Financial Statements.”\nmark-to-market gains and losses\nimmediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. We will record the annual mark-to-market adjustment as of the measurement date, December 31, 2025. It is difficult to predict the December 31, 2025 adjustment amount, as it will be dependent primarily on changes in discount rates during 2025, and actual returns on plan assets differing from our expected returns for 2025.\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2025, the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $39.8 billion, about $2.4 billion higher than the second quarter of 2025 due to increases in the Energy & Transportation segment. Of the total backlog at September 30, 2025, approximately $12.5 billion was not expected to be filled in the following twelve months.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe provide the following definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.\nWe believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of two significant items in order for the company’s results to be meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) other restructuring income/costs and (ii) restructuring income/costs related to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities in 2024. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-GAAP measure provides investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aids with assessing the company’s period-over-period results.\nReconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are as follows:\n(Dollars in millions except per share data)\nOperating Profit Margin\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 - U.S. GAAP\n\nRestructuring (income) costs - divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities\nOther restructuring (income) costs\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 - Adjusted\nWe believe it is important to separately disclose our annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items for our results to be meaningful to our readers. The annual effective tax rate is discussed using non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of amounts associated with discrete items recorded fully in the quarter they occur. These items consist of (i) the increase in the annual effective tax rate in 2025, (ii) the impact of changes in estimates related to prior years (iii) the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense and (iv) restructuring costs related to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities in 2024. We believe the non-GAAP measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aids with assessing the company's period-over-period results.\nA reconciliation of our effective tax rate to annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items is below:\n(Millions of dollars)\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 - U.S. GAAP\n\nOther restructuring (income) costs\nRestructuring (income) costs - divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities\nA detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is included on pages\nTotal sales and revenues for the third quarter of 2025 were $17.638 billion, an increase of $1.532 billion, or 10 percent, compared with $16.106 billion in the third quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher\nof $1.554 billion. The increase in sales volume was mainly driven by higher sales of equipment to end users.\nThird-quarter 2025 profit per share was $4.88, compared with $5.06 profit per share in the third quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, profit per share included restructuring costs. Profit for the third quarter of 2025 was $2.300 billion, a decrease of $164 million, or 7 percent, compared with $2.464 billion for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was mainly due to unfavorable manufacturing costs, unfavorable price realization and higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and\nresearch and development (R&D) expenses. This was partially offset by the profit impact of higher sales volume, favorable other operating income/expense and lower restructuring costs.\nTrends and Economic Conditions\nOutlook for Key End Markets\nConstruction Industries\n, we are encouraged by another quarter of growth in sales of equipment to end users and strong order rates across many of our regions. Customers continue to be responsive to the attractive rates through our merchandising programs with Cat Financial. We continue to anticipate growth in Construction Industries’ sales of equipment to end users in 2025 despite softness in the global industry. In North America, overall construction spending remains at healthy levels and infrastructure projects funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) continue to be awarded. We continue to expect growth for sales of equipment to end users. Dealer rental revenues are also expected to grow in 2025, and dealer rental fleet loading is expected to increase in the fourth quarter of 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. In Asia Pacific, sales of equipment to end users are expected to be about flat in 2025. China has shown positive momentum to start the year, and we expect growth in the above-10-ton excavator industry in 2025, but from a very low level of activity. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we expect economic conditions to be soft. In\nEAME\n, we expect growth for the year, driven by healthy construction activity in Africa and the Middle East and improving economic conditions in Europe. With ongoing weaker construction activity in\n, we now expect to be about flat in 2025.\n, we anticipate lower sales of equipment to end users in 2025 as compared to 2024, as customers continue to display capital discipline. However, we see positive momentum with healthy orders for large mining trucks, articulated trucks and large track type tractors. Although most key commodities remain above investment thresholds, declining coal prices have caused an increase in the number of parked trucks. As a re"
