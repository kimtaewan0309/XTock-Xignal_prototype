We have supply agreements with Ball Corporation and other vendors to purchase aluminum containers in addition to what is supplied from RMMC.\nIn the Americas segment, a portion of the glass bottles are purchased from Rocky Mountain Bottle Company (\"RMBC\"), our joint venture with Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc., whose production facilities, which are leased from us, are located in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. We have supply agreements with Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc., and other vendors for requirements in excess of RMBC's production.\nIn the EMEA&APAC segments, we manage packaging needs through diversified contracts, which have provided a reliable supply of aluminum cans, glass bottles, and kegs. Flexible keg sourcing adapts to annual changes, enhancing supply security without long-term commitments.\nMany of our ingredients, raw materials and commodities for both brewing and packaging are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including commodity swaps and options. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase for materials, we may or may not be able to pass on such increases to our customers.\nThrough our overall business strategy and our sustainability strategy, referred to as \"Our Imprint,\" we have established goals and supporting initiatives for Putting People First and Preserving Our Planet in an attempt to ensure we are good stewards of the assets and resources most important to our business. More information about our strategy and progress can be found in Our Imprint Report, available at www.molsoncoors.com/goals-and-reporting. The information provided on our website (or any other website referred to in this report) is not part of this report and is not incorporated by reference as part of this report.\nOur Board of Directors (\"Board\") is responsible for overseeing and monitoring Our Imprint Strategy, with specific areas of oversight delegated to the committees of the Board. The Board receives regular reports and recommendations from management and the Board committees to help guide our strategy, from goals related to water, packaging and climate change, to initiatives focused on building a strong culture and engagement within our people, our workplace and our marketplace. At the management level, our executive leadership team, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the oversight and the evolution of Our Imprint Strategy. Our Vice President of Sustainability & EHS works closely with the executive leadership team on strategy development, initiative implementation and progress for our environmental sustainability focus areas.\nOur executive leadership team and the chief people and culture officers for the Americas and EMEA&APAC segments are tasked with managing all employment-related matters including recruitment, retention, leadership and development, compensation and benefits planning, succession planning, performance management, and culture and engagement. The Compensation and Human Resource Committee (\"CHR Committee\") of the Board is responsible for establishing and reviewing the overall compensation philosophy of our Company and providing oversight on certain human capital matters and initiatives, including those related to our talent retention and development, leadership development, talent pipeline, programs and systems for performance management, health and safety and our culture and engagement.\nPutting People First\nWe believe that people are the heart of our Company and strive to create a culture where people are encouraged to and feel comfortable to bring their unique perspectives and experiences to drive our business forward. As a global company, we believe we have a responsibility to nurture a workforce that reflects our marketplace, which we believe makes us a better employer, partner and company of choice for our consumers and customers.\nWe have a global and varied workforce, with major employee centers in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Romania. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 16,800 employees within our business globally with approximately 10,300 employees within our Americas segment and 6,500 employees within our EMEA&APAC segment. Approximately 700 of our employees are in our Global Business Services Centers based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Bucharest, Romania. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 28% and 24% of our Americas segment and EMEA&APAC segment workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions or councils, which are subject to collective bargaining agreements that come due for renegotiation from time to time.\nWe believe fostering a strong culture with a highly engaged workforce is critical to how we operate, from how we work together to how we grow as a company. Related action plans for the Americas and EMEA&APAC segments are expected to be delivered through three key pillars: People, Workplace and Marketplace.\nTo be first choice for our employees, we deploy programs, policies and initiatives to foster a culture of engagement where employees have the opportunity to learn and grow, developing both professionally and personally. Our 2024 initiatives and progress included:\nBusiness Resource Groups\n- In both Americas and EMEA&APAC, we promoted and supported our self-governed employee Business Resource Groups (\"BRGs\") in their work to connect, engage, and develop their members while achieving business and strategic objectives. Our BRGs are supportive to their members and allies and are acknowledged internally and externally for building an inclusive workplace, supporting business growth and member development and enriching the communities in which we do business.\n- We strive to be a provider of meaningful experiences and a safe and healthy workplace for all employees.\n- We promote healthy lifestyles across our global enterprise by offering health and insurance benefits and wellness and work/life balance programs that are tailored to employees' needs and culture by work location. In the Americas, employees can participate in our wellness programs that incentivize healthy habits and lifestyles. These resources include connections to virtual healthcare, remote fitness and wellness support, and a free employee assistance program for coping with stress and anxiety. In the EMEA&APAC regions, we drive our employee wellbeing culture through a team made up of regional representatives who coordinate activities focused on the topics based on employee feedback. In 2024, these activities included certain wellness programs, as well as flexible work hours, wellness webinars and challenges, to further emphasize our wellbeing culture.\n- We also promote safe and healthy behaviors at work and home. Our commitment to Health & Safety is focused on preventing workplace incidents and building a strong behavior-based safety culture across our entire workforce through training, our World Class Supply Chain operating system, our values-based leadership development approach and safety moments at the start of many meetings in both our manufacturing facilities and office environments.\nCompensation and Benefits\n- We offer affordable and comprehensive benefits, which we routinely benchmark to try to ensure they are competitive, inclusive, aligned with our company culture and local practices, and allow our employees to meet their individual needs and the needs of their families. Our Total Rewards program in general provides a competitive base salary, incentive plans, health and insurance benefits, a deferred compensation option in certain regions with a potential employer match, paid time off plans, enhanced parental leave policies in many locations, an engaging Wellness Program and an Employee Assistance Program. Our business units comply with applicable parental leave laws and in many cases go further to provide flexible work schedules and extended leave for new parents. We believe our compensation and incentive programs motivate us to ignite growth and help to hold ourselves accountable for living out our values to achieve our short- and long-term goals.\n- Our aim is to help employees unlock their full potential so they can thrive in their current job and realize new, potential growth opportunities. At Molson Coors, First Choice Learning serves as the global home for development resources to support the unique needs of our employees around the world. First Choice Learning invests in our people through in-person and online training programs, and experiential training opportunities to support employee health and safety, assist in building core competencies, share best practices and develop leadership capabilities. In 2024, we continued to invest in targeted development programs, including one aimed to accelerate the readiness of high potential employees to move into roles of greater scope and complexity. These programs include a blend of classroom training, coaching and mentoring and experiential action learning projects.\n\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nUnless otherwise noted in this report, any description of \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\" includes Molson Coors Beverage Company (\"MCBC\" or the \"Company\"), principally a holding company, and its operating and non-operating subsidiaries included within its reporting segments. Our reporting segments include the Americas and EMEA&APAC. Unless otherwise indicated, information in this report is presented in USD and comparisons are to comparable prior periods. Our primary operating currencies, other than the USD, include the CAD, the GBP and our Central European operating currencies, such as the EUR, CZK, RON and RSD.\nBusiness and Market Overview\nFor more than two centuries, we have brewed beverages that unite people to celebrate all life’s moments. From our core power brands\nCoors Light, Miller Lite, Coors Banquet, Molson Canadian, Carling\nto our above premium brands including\nMadrí Excepcional, Staropramen, Blue Moon Belgian White\nLeinenkugel’s Summer Shandy\n, to our economy and value brands like\n, we produce many beloved and iconic beers. While our Company's history is rooted in beer, we offer a modern portfolio that expands beyond the beer aisle as well, including flavored beverages like\nwhiskey and non-alcoholic beverages. We also have partner brands, such as\n, among others, through license, distribution, partnership and joint venture agreements. As a business, our ambition is to be the first choice for our people, our consumers and our customers, and our success depends on our ability to make our products available to meet a wide range of consumer segments and occasions.\nOur primary founders, the Molson, Coors and Miller families date back over two centuries. Our commitment to producing the highest quality beers is a key part of our heritage and remains so to this day. Our brands are designed to appeal to a wide range of consumer tastes, styles and price preferences. Coors Brewing Company was incorporated in June 1913 under the laws of the state of Colorado. In October 2003, Coors Brewing Company merged with and into Adolph Coors Company, a Delaware corporation. In February 2005, Adolph Coors Company merged with Molson Inc. (\"the Merger\").

We calculate the impact of foreign exchange by translating our current period local currency results at the average exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior year period during the respective period throughout the year and comparing that amount with the reported amount for the period. The impact of transactional foreign currency gains and losses, including the impact of undesignated foreign currency forwards, is recorded within other non-operating income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nFinancial volume represents owned or actively managed brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographic markets (net of returns and allowances), as well as contract brewing, factored non-owned volume and company-owned distribution volume. This metric is presented on a sales-to-wholesalers (\"STW\") basis to reflect the sales from our operations to our direct customers, generally distributors. We believe this metric is important and useful for investors and management because it gives an indication of the amount of beer and adjacent products that we have produced and shipped to customers. This metric excludes royalty volume, which consists of our brands produced and sold under various license and contract brewing agreements. Factored volume in our EMEA&APAC segment is the distribution of beer, wine, spirits and other products owned and produced by other companies to the on-premise channel such as bars and restaurants, which is a common arrangement in the U.K.\nThe following table highlights the drivers of the change in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, (in percentages):\nConsolidated net sales\nNet sales decreased 0.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year driven by lower financial volumes, partially offset by favorable price and sales mix.\nFinancial volumes decreased 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year, due to lower shipments in the Americas, including lower contract brewing volumes representing almost half of the decline as well as the impact of the macroeconomic environment resulting in industry softness. EMEA&APAC financial volumes also decreased 2.6%.\nPrice and sales mix favorably impacted net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, by 4.4%, primarily due to increased net pricing as well as favorable sales mix for both segments, including as a result of lower contract brewing volumes in the Americas as well as premiumization and favorable channel mix in EMEA&APAC.\nA discussion of currency impacts on net sales is included in the \"Foreign currency impacts on results\" section above.\nWe utilize cost of goods sold per hectoliter, as well as the year over year changes in this metric, as a key metric for analyzing our results. This metric is calculated as cost of goods sold per our consolidated statements of operations divided by financial volume for the respective period. We believe this metric is important and useful for investors and management because it provides an indication of the trends of sales mix and other cost impacts on our cost of goods sold.\nCost of goods sold decreased 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to lower financial volumes, partially offset by higher cost of goods sold per hectoliter. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 1.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to cost inflation related to materials and manufacturing expenses, unfavorable mix driven by lower contract brewing volumes and volume deleverage in the Americas segment, partially offset by favorable changes in our unrealized mark-to-market commodity derivative positions of $133.0 million and cost savings initiatives.\nA discussion of currency impacts on cost of goods sold is included in the \"Foreign currency impacts on results\" section above.\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses\nMG&A expenses decreased 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and lower marketing resulting from cycling higher investment levels in the prior year.\nA discussion of currency impacts on marketing, general and administrative expenses is included in the \"Foreign currency impacts on results\" section above.\nOther operating income (expense), net\nOther operating expense, net improved 59.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to the cycling of a $160.7 million partial impairment charge to our indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the\nfamily of brands recorded in the prior year as well as a $77.9 million gain recognized upon the consolidation of ZOA in the fourth quarter of 2024, partially offset by the costs incurred related to the wind down and sale of certain U.S. craft businesses and related restructuring costs including accelerated depreciation charges in excess of normal depreciation of $93.6 million as well as a $41.2 million loss on the disposal of the sold businesses. See\nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17, \"Other Operating Income (Expense), net\"\nfor further detail of our other operating income (expense), net.\nTotal non-operating income (expense), net\nTotal non-operating expense, net increased 34.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year primarily due to higher interest expense driven by a $45.8 million adjustment to increase our mandatorily redeemable NCI liability to the final redemption value related to the CBPL buyout recorded in the third quarter of 2024, a settlement loss of $34.0 million recorded as a result of Canadian pension plan annuity purchases and unfavorable transactional foreign currency impacts, partially offset by higher pension and OPEB non-service benefit.\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\nOur effective tax rate decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024\ncompared to the prior year, in part due to the impact of the $77.9 million gain recognized upon the consolidation of ZOA in the fourth quarter of 2024, which is non-taxable. The decrease was partially offset by (i) the $20.0 million increase in valuation allowance that was recorded on deferred tax assets related to the sale of certain U.S. craft businesses in the third quarter of 2024, and (ii) the impact of the $45.8 million increase in the mandatorily redeemable NCI liability of CBPL in the third quarter of 2024, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, was further decreased by the recognition of additional net tax benefit items totaling $12.8 million, as compared to the recognition of additional net tax expense items totaling $10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur effective tax rate can be volatile and may change with, among other things, the amount and source of pretax income or loss, our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation, changes in tax laws and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, could have an impact on our effective tax rate.\nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12, \"Income Tax\"\nfor further discussion regarding our effective tax rate.\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the recording of an out of period adjustment in the third quarter 2024 to increase the noncontrolling interest to the best estimate of the redemption value that existed at the time of the put option exercise in March 2024.

Higher other operating expense, net was primarily due to the wind down and sale of certain of our U.S. craft businesses and related restructuring costs, including accelerated depreciation charges in excess of normal depreciation of $93.6 million as well as a $41.2 million loss on the disposal of the sold businesses, partially offset by a $77.9 million gain recognized upon the consolidation of ZOA in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The improvement was primarily due to the cycling of a $160.7 million partial impairment charge to our indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the\nfamily of brands recorded in the prior year, increased net pricing, favorable sales mix and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher net interest expense, lower financial volumes and higher MG&A spend. Higher net interest expense was driven by an adjustment of $45.8 million to increase our mandatorily redeemable NCI liability to the final redemption value related to the CBPL buyout in the third quarter of 2024. Higher MG&A spend was due to increased strategic and transformation project costs as well as increased marketing to support our brands and innovations.\nA discussion of currency impacts on income (loss) before income taxes is included in the \"Foreign currency impacts on results\" section above.\nWe have certain activity that is not allocated to our segments, which has been reflected as Unallocated below.
