F\noreign currency translation had a 0.3% negative impact on total cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs. Cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs increased slightly to 39.5% of total revenue from 39.0%.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased 7.2% as compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by an increase in third-party fees related to acquisitions and integration activities, along with an increase in bad debt expenses and\nemployee compensation, driven by revenue growth\n. Foreign currency translation had a 0.3% negative impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Operating, administrative and other expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 13.1% from 13.9%, as operating expenses grew slower than revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by 8.7% during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, reflecting higher depreciation and amortization expense related to assets acquired from recent acquisitions, such as Industrious.\nGain on disposition of real estate increased by $43 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, driven by monetization of real estate development assets in the REI segment.\nWe reported equity income of $50 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to equity loss of $77 million in the same period in 2024. This was primarily driven by positive co-investment returns and sales in the current period, compared to higher unrealized equity losses in the prior period, driven by a fair value adjustment related to our non-core strategic equity investment in Altus.\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased by 2.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period\nin 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of net investment hedging activity, partially offset by the impact of increased comm\nercial paper borrowings and the issuance of senior term loans and new senior unsecured notes.\nOur provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $203 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to a provision for income taxes of $70 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase of $133 million is primarily related to an increase in earnings, favorable permanent book tax differences, and a prior year benefit for the reversal of unrecognized tax positions. Our effective tax rate increased to 19.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from 11.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our effective tax rate for the nine months\nended September 30, 2025 is different than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to the U.S. state taxes and favorable permanent book tax differences.\nIn January 2025, we combined our project management business with our Turner & Townsend majority-owned subsidiary and created a fourth reportable segment, Project Management. In addition, on January 16, 2025, we acquired full ownership of Industrious, a provider of premium flexible workplace solutions, and established a new business segment, Building Operations & Experience (BOE), comprised of enterprise and local facilities management, property management and flexible workplace solutions.\nIn connection with the transactions described above, we organized our operations around, and publicly report our financial results on, four reportable business segments: (1) Advisory Services; (2) BOE; (3) Project Management; and (4) Real Estate Investments (REI).\nAdvisory Services provides a comprehensive range of services globally, including property leasing, capital markets (property sales and loan origination), loan servicing, and valuation. BOE provides a broad suite of integrated, contractually based outsourcing services to occupiers and owners of real estate, including facilities management and property management. Our Project Management business delivers program management, project management and cost consultancy services across commercial real estate, infrastructure and natural resources sectors. REI is a major real assets developer, investor and operator and is comprised of two businesses: investment management and development services.\nWe also have a Corporate and Other segment. Corporate primarily consists of corporate overhead costs. Other consists of activities from strategic non-core non-controlling equity investments and is considered an operating segment but does not meet the aggregation criteria for presentation as a separate reportable segment and is, therefore, combined with Corporate and reported as Corporate and other. It also includes eliminations related to inter-segment revenue. For additional information on our segments, see Note 16 – Segments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for our Advisory Services operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nOther portfolio services\nCommercial mortgage origination\nTotal segment revenue\nCost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs\nOperating, administrative and other\nDepreciation and amortization\nTotal costs and expenses\nEquity loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries\nAdd-back: Depreciation and amortization\nImpact of fair value non-cash adjustments related to unconsolidated equity investments\nCosts associated with efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives\nSegment operating profit\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nCalculated as a percentage of Total Revenue.\nPass-through costs represent certain costs incurred associated with subcontracted third-party vendor work performed for clients. These costs are reimbursable by clients and the corresponding amounts owed are reflected within Revenue.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenue increased 16.8% during the quarter compared to the same period in 2024. Property sales revenue grew 29.5%, led by office, industrial, land and data centers in the U.S., APAC and Europe. Globally, sales grew double-digits across office, industrial and multifamily. Global leasing revenue rose 17.6%, led by data centers, office and industrial leasing driven by Americas which grew 19.1%, including 17.9% in the United States and APAC which grew 21.6%.\nForeign currency translation had a 1.0% positive impact on total revenue during the quarter, primarily driven by strength in the euro and British pound sterling partially offset by weakness in the Australian dollar and Indian rupee.\nCost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs increased 17.5%, primarily reflecting business growth and higher commission expense. Foreign currency translation had a 0.9% negative impact on total cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs. Cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs as a percentage of total revenue increased slightly to 58.1% compared to the same period in 2024, as costs of revenue increased proportionately with the increase in revenue.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased by 7.6%, as compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher employee compensation and business promotion, advertising and travel expenses driven by the growth in the business. Foreign currency translation had a 1.3% negative impact on total operating expenses.\nIn connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on the date the loans are sold. Upon origination of a mortgage loan held for sale, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights to be retained is included in the forecasted proceeds from the anticipated loan sale and results in a net gain (which is reflected in revenue). Our MSRs are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized in proportion to and over the period that the servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows and assessed for impairment based on the fair value each reporting period.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, MSRs contributed $41 million to operating income, offset by $36 million of amortization of related intangible assets. The MSR contribution to third quarter 2024 operating income was $38 million and amortization totaled $36 million. The increase was associated with higher origination activity given an increase in financing activities and strong performance in both agency and non-agency lending.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased 3.0% primarily due to higher amortization of mortgage servicing rights as described above.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenue incre"
