  "item1_clean": "\"External conditions, including those related to general economic, marketplace and global health conditions...\"\nPhysician relationships\nJoint venture partners\nWe own and operate certain of our dialysis centers through entities that are structured as joint ventures. We generally hold controlling interests in these joint ventures, with nephrologists, hospitals, management services organizations, and/or other healthcare providers holding minority equity interests. These joint ventures are typically formed as limited liability companies. For the year ended December 31, 2024, revenues from joint ventures in which we have a controlling interest represented approximately 30% of our U.S. dialysis revenues. We expect to continue to enter into new U.S. dialysis-related joint ventures in the ordinary course of business.\nCommunity physicians\nAn ESKD patient generally seeks treatment or support for their home treatment at an outpatient dialysis center near their home where their treating nephrologist has practice privileges. Our relationships with local nephrologists and our ability to provide quality dialysis services and to meet the needs of their patients are key factors in the success of our dialysis operations. Nearly 5,300 nephrologists currently refer patients to our outpatient dialysis centers.\nParticipation in the Medicare ESRD program requires that dialysis services at an outpatient dialysis center be under the general supervision of a medical director. Per these requirements, this individual is usually a board certified nephrologist. We engage physicians or groups of physicians to serve as medical directors for each of our outpatient dialysis centers. At some outpatient dialysis centers, we also separately contract with one or more other physicians or groups to serve as assistant or associate medical directors over other modalities such as home dialysis. We have over 900 individual physicians and physician groups under contract to provide medical director services.\nMedical directors for our dialysis centers enter into written contracts with us that specify their duties and fix their compensation. These agreements range in duration, but generally are for periods of ten years. The compensation of our medical\ndirectors is the result of arm’s length negotiations, consistent with fair market value, and generally depends upon an analysis of various factors such as the physician’s duties, responsibilities, professional qualifications and experience, as well as the time and effort required to provide such services.\nOur medical director contracts and joint venture operating agreements generally include covenants not to compete or own interests in dialysis centers operated by other providers within a defined geographic area for various time periods, as applicable. These non-compete agreements do not restrict or limit the physicians from practicing medicine or prohibit the physicians from referring patients to any outpatient dialysis center, including dialysis centers operated by other providers.\nLocation of our U.S. dialysis centers\nWe operated 2,657 outpatient dialysis centers in the U.S. as of December 31, 2024 and 2,605 of these centers are consolidated in our financial statements. Of the remaining 52 nonconsolidated U.S. outpatient dialysis centers, we own noncontrolling interests in 49 centers and provide management and administrative services to three centers that are wholly-owned by third parties. The locations of the 2,605 U.S. outpatient dialysis centers consolidated in our financial statements at December 31, 2024, were as follows:\nAncillary services, including our international operations\nOur ancillary services relate primarily to our core business of providing kidney care services. As of December 31, 2024, these consisted primarily of our U.S. integrated kidney care (IKC) business, certain U.S. other ancillary businesses (including our clinical research programs, transplant software business, and venture investment group), and our international operations.\nWe have made and continue to make investments in building our integrated care capabilities, including the operation of certain strategic business initiatives that are intended to integrate and coordinate care among healthcare participants across the renal care continuum from CKD to ESKD to kidney transplant. Through improved technology and data sharing, as well as an increasing focus on value-based contracting and care, these initiatives seek to bring together physicians, nurses, dieticians, pharmacists, hospitals, dialysis clinics, transplant centers, payors and other specialists with a view towards improving clinical outcomes for our patients and reducing the overall cost of comprehensive kidney care. Certain of our ancillary services are described below.\nU.S. Integrated Kidney Care\nIntegrated Kidney Care.\nDaVita Integrated Kidney Care (DaVita IKC), provides advanced integrated care management services to health plans and government programs for members/beneficiaries diagnosed with ESKD and CKD. Through a combination of health monitoring, clinical coordination, innovative interventions, predictive analytics, medical claims analysis and information technology, we endeavor to assist our health plan and government program customers and patients in obtaining superior renal healthcare and improved clinical outcomes, as well as helping to reduce overall medical costs. Integrated kidney care management revenues from commercial and Medicare Advantage insurers can be based upon either an established contract fee recognized as earned for services provided over the contract period, or related to the operation of risk-based and value-based care programs, including shared savings, pay-for-performance, and capitation contracts. DaVita IKC also contracts with payors to support MA ESKD chronic condition special needs plans (C-SNPs) to provide ESKD patients full service healthcare and integrated care management services. DaVita IKC currently participates in both the involuntary and certain voluntary payment models administered by CMMI. As described below under the heading \"\n—Government regulation\n\", we have invested resources, and expect to continue to invest substantial resources in these models as part of our overall plan to grow our integrated kidney care business and value-based care initiatives. See Note 1,\nin the Company's consolidated financial statements for more information on how the Company accounts for its integrated care arrangements.\nThe Company is also developing, and has entered into, various forms of technology-based, administrative, financial and other collaboration and incentive arrangements with physician partners and other providers in support of our innovative care model, developing and expanding IKC programs and arrangements.\nU.S. Other Ancillary services\nClinical research programs.\nDaVita Clinical Research (DCR) is a provider-based specialty clinical research organization with a wide spectrum of services for clinical drug research and device development. DCR uses its extensive real-world healthcare expertise to assist in the design, recruitment and completion of retrospective and prospective studies. Revenues are based upon study generated fees, as determined by contract with drug companies and other sponsors, and are recognized as earned according to the contract terms.\nTransplant software business.\nDaVita's transplant software business, MedSleuth, works with transplant centers across the U.S. to provide greater connectivity among transplant candidates, transplant centers, physicians and care teams to help improve the experience and outcomes for kidney and liver transplant patients.\nDaVita Venture Group (DVG) focuses on innovative products, solutions and businesses that improve care for patients with kidney disease and related conditions. DVG identifies companies and products for acquisitions, strategic partnerships, and venture investment opportunities. DVG’s focus includes innovation in digital health, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and care delivery models.\nFor additional discussion of our ancillary services, see Part II Item 7, \"\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nInternational dialysis operations\nWe operated, managed or administered 509 outpatient dialysis centers located in 13 countries outside of the U.S. serving approximately 80,300 patients as of December 31, 2024. Our international dialysis operations have continued to grow steadily and expand as a result of acquiring and developing outpatient dialysis centers in various strategic markets. Our international operations are included in our ancillary services.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the international outpatient dialysis centers we operate or provide administrative services to were located as follows:\n\nhttp://www.davita.com\nwhere these reports and other information about us can be obtained. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this report.\nOverview of DaVita Inc.\nDaVita is a leading healthcare provider focused on transforming care delivery to improve quality of life for patients globally. As a comprehensive kidney care provider, we have been a leader in clinical quality and innovation for 25 years. We care for patients at every stage and setting along their kidney health journey\nfrom earlier diagnosis and prevention through supporting the transplant process. This includes ensuring they are supported at home, in our dialysis centers, in the hospital and/or skilled nursing facilities. In our unwavering pursuit of a healthier tomorrow, we strive to reimagine what high quality care looks like: more preventative, better integrated, improved outcomes at the lowest total cost, and personalized at scale to deliver a better tomorrow regardless of location, insurance status or other factors. Our caring culture fuels our continuous drive toward achieving our mission to be the provider, partner and employer of choice.\nDefining chronic kidney disease\nThere are five stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). These stages are generally based on how well the kidneys work to filter waste and extra fluid out of the blood–with higher stages of CKD corresponding to progressing levels of kidney disease. Stage 1 CKD is the closest to healthy kidney function. Stage 5 CKD indicates that a patient has severe kidney damage.\nA patient diagnosed with Stage 5 CKD has kidneys that have lost nearly all functionality or have failed. If an individual's kidneys fail, the person is then diagnosed with end stage renal disease (ESRD), also known as end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Because kidney function is essential for survival and the loss of kidney function is normally irreversible, ESKD patients require continued dialysis treatments or a kidney transplant to sustain life. Dialysis is the removal of toxins, fluids and salt from the blood of patients by artificial means. Patients suffering from ESKD generally require regular life-sustaining dialysis therapy for the rest of their lives or until they receive a kidney transplant.\nThe treatment goal for CKD patients prior to Stage 5 is to manage and slow the progression of the disease to preserve kidney functionality. Because kidney failure is typically caused by one or more comorbidities such as Type I and Type II diabetes, hypertension, polycystic kidney disease, long-term autoimmune attack on the kidneys or prolonged urinary tract obstruction, slowing the progression generally involves working with nephrologists and dieticians to help control blood pressure, monitor blood glucose and maintain healthy diet and exercise routines, among other things. If the kidney disease continues to progress, the goal is to support efforts for kidney transplantation where available and medically appropriate, and in the event transplantation is not possible, to work with the patient and his or her nephrologist to safely transition the patient to the dialysis treatment and ",

We estimate that we have approximately a 36% share of the U.S. dialysis market based upon the number of patients we serve.\nApproximately 88% of our 2024 consolidated revenues were derived directly from our U.S. dialysis business. The principal drivers of our U.S. dialysis revenues include :\nour number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three in-center treatments per week as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis; and\nour average dialysis patient service revenue per treatment, including the mix of patients with commercial plans and government programs as primary payor.\nWithin our U.S. dialysis business, our home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services are operationally integrated with our outpatient dialysis centers and related laboratory services. Our outpatient, home-based and hospital inpatient dialysis services comprise approximately 75%, 19% and 6% of our U.S. dialysis revenues, respectively.\nIn the U.S., government dialysis-related payment rates are principally determined by federal Medicare and state Medicaid policy. For 2024, approximately 67% of our total U.S. dialysis patient service revenues were generated from government-based programs for services to approximately 89% of our total U.S. patients. These government-based programs are principally Medicare and MA, Medicaid and managed Medicaid plans, and other government plans, representing approximately 56%, 8% and 3% of our U.S. dialysis patient service revenues, respectively.\nIn November 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final rule to update the Medicare ESRD Prospective Payment System payment rate and policies for calendar year 2024. CMS has finalized ESRD facilities' average reimbursement by a productivity-adjusted market basket increase of 2.2% in 2025. In addition, from time-to-time CMS identifies drugs to be added to the ESRD PPS bundled payment. On January 1, 2025, phosphate binders, a drug class taken orally by many ESKD patients to reduce absorption of dietary phosphate, were incorporated into the ESRD PPS bundle. Phosphate binders are not considered accounted for in the ESRD PPS base rate at this time and will be reimbursed through a Transitional Drug Add-on Payment Adjustment (TDAPA). The TDAPA period is expected to continue for a period of at least two years. Currently, phosphate binders are offered in both generic and branded forms and are produced by multiple manufacturers. During this TDAPA period, our operating results could be materially impacted by certain factors, including physician prescribing patterns, the terms of supplier and other vendor contracts, the mix of branded and generic forms of the drug used by our patients, whether the drug enters into the ESRD PPS and becomes part of its bundled payment following TDAPA and, if so, at what rate and how payors will treat reimbursement of the drug at the conclusion of the TDAPA period.\nDialysis payment rates from commercial payors vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. On average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients in relation to total patients represents a significant driver of our total average dialysis patient service revenue per treatment. Commercial payors (including hospital dialysis services) represent approximately 33% of U.S. dialysis patient service revenues.\nFor a discussion of government reimbursement, the Medicare ESRD bundled payment system, MA and commercial reimbursement, see Part I Item 1\nU.S. dialysis business – Sources of revenue-concentrations and risks.\"\nFor a discussion of operational, clinical and financial risks and uncertainties that we face in connection with the Medicare ESRD bundled payment system, see the risk factor in Part I Item 1A.\n\" under the heading \"\nOur business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements...\"\nFor a discussion of operational, clinical and financial risks and uncertainties that we face in connection with commercial payors, see the risk factor in Part I Item 1A.\nIf the number or percentage of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, if the average rates that commercial payors pay us declines...\nWe anticipate that we will continue to experience increases in our operating costs in 2025 that may outpace any net Medicare, commercial or other rate increases that we may receive, which could significantly impact our operating results. In particular, we expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, including increases in maintenance costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in Medicare, commercial or other payor payment rates. In addition, we expect to continue to incur capital expenditures and associated depreciation and amortization costs to improve, renovate and maintain our facilities, equipment and information technology to meet evolving regulatory requirements and otherwise.\nU.S. dialysis patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers, home-based dialysis programs and hospital inpatient dialysis programs, and consist principally of labor, benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers.\nThe principal drivers of our U.S. dialysis patient care costs include:\nclinical hours per treatment, labor rates and benefit costs;\nvendor pricing and utilization levels of pharmaceuticals;\nbusiness infrastructure costs, which include the operating costs of our dialysis centers; and\nmedical supply costs.\nOther cost categories that can present significant variability include insurance costs and professional fees. In addition, proposed ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes could cause us to incur substantial costs to prepare for, or implement changes required. Any such changes could result in, among other things, increases in our labor costs or limitations on the amount of revenue that we can retain. For additional information on risks associated with potential and proposed ballot initiatives, referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes, see the risk factor in Part I Item 1A. \"\nunder the heading, \"\nChanges in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations...\nOur average clinical hours per treatment decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to a decrease in turnover as described below. We are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in factors such as federal and state\npolicies or regulatory billing requirements can lead to increased labor costs as can increases in turnover. In 2024, the demand for skilled clinical personnel continued, exacerbated by the nationwide shortage of these resources. In 2024 and 2023, we experienced increases in our clinical labor wage rates, which includes contract labor, of approximately 3.8% and 1.3%, respectively. We expect to continue to see higher clinical labor rates in 2025 due to labor market conditions, including changes in local minimum wage laws, and the continued competition for skilled clinical personnel. In 2024, our overall clinical teammate turnover decreased from 2023, but remains elevated from historical pre-COVID levels. We also continue to experience increases in the infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers and general increases in utilities and repairs and maintenance. In 2024, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to help manage our overall operating costs, including labor productivity, and we expect to continue these initiatives in 2025.\nOur U.S. dialysis general and administrative expenses represented 10.3% and 10.1% of our U.S. dialysis revenues in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Increases in general and administrative expenses over the last several years were primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business and related compliance and operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters and professional fees. We expect that these levels of general and administrative expenses will be impacted by continued investment in developing our capabilities and executing on our strategic priorities, among other things.\nU.S. dialysis results of operations\n\nFor a reconciliation of adjusted operating income by reportable segment, see the \"\nReconciliations of non-GAAP measures\nU.S. dialysis operating income for 2024 compared to 2023 was positively impacted by a gain on a change in business ownership interest and severance costs, as described above. U.S. dialysis operating income and adjusted operating income increased compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in our average patient service revenue per treatment and dialysis treatments, as described above, as well as decreases in charitable contributions, center closure costs, as described above, other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, contract wages and a gain on settlement, as described above. These increases in operating income and adjusted operating income were partially offset by increases in compensation expenses, as described above, as well as increases in health benefit expense, IT-related costs, medical supply costs, advocacy costs and utilities expense, as described above. Operating income and adjusted operating income were also negatively impacted by increased insurance costs, routine repairs and maintenance and professional fees.\nOther - Ancillary services\nOur other operations include ancillary services that are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. As of December 31, 2024, these consisted primarily of our U.S. IKC business, certain U.S. other ancillary businesses (including our clinical research programs, transplant software business, and venture investment group), and our international operations.\nThese ancillary services, including our international operations, generated revenues of approximately $1.510 billion in 2024, representing approximately 12% of our consolidated revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2024, DaVita IKC provided integrated care and disease management services to approximately 70,400 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements and to an additional 11,600 patients in other integrated care arrangements. We also expect to add additional service offerings to our business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include, among other things, healthcare services not related to kidney disease.\nFor a discussion of the risks related to IKC and our ancillary services, see the discussion in the risk factors in Part I Item 1A. \"\n\" under the headings, \"\nThe U.S. integrated kidney care, U.S. other ancillary services and international operations that we operate or invest in now or in the future\nIf we are not able to successfully implement our strategy with respect to our integrated kidney care and value-based care initiatives\nAs of December 31, 2024, our international dialysis business owned or operated 509 outpatient dialysis centers located in 13 countries outside of the U.S. For 2024, total revenues generated from our international operations were approximately 8% of our consolidated revenues.\nAncillary services results of operations\n\nItem 7.
