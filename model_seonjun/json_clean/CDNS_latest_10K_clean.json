  "item1_clean": "Our Intelligent System Design™ (“ISD”) strategy allows us to deliver solutions to our customers to solve their most complex product development challenges. Our industry-leading computational software, accelerated hardware, and IP enable us to adapt to our customer's dynamic design requirements, allowing them to meet their critical business and environmental concerns including time-to-market and sustainability. The creation of even the most seemingly simple electronic systems and products typically includes a complex design process and requires highly trained engineers with various areas of specialized knowledge and skill sets. Our ability to deliver innovative products that keep up with increasing complexity allows our customers to be successful in meeting their business goals and objectives.\nHistorically, the industry that provided the software tools IC engineers used was called Electronic Design Automation (“EDA”). The pace of technical innovation in EDA has been driven by a concept known as Moore’s Law, which more than 50 years ago predicted that the complexity of ICs would double approximately every 18-24 months. Our strategy, illustrated in the graphic below, is focused on three primary areas: Design Excellence, System Innovation, and Pervasive Intelligence.\nfocuses on our core technology and deep understanding of computational software, accelerated computing, machine learning, and AI to develop best-in-class electronic design and analysis semiconductor solutions. In this area, customers are primarily developing large chips including those used in computers, laptops, cellphones, medical devices, games and entertainment systems, and many other types of consumer electronics. Design Excellence applies to all types of semiconductor electronics including CPUs, GPUs, MCUs, memory, radio frequency (“RF”), analog, and mixed-signal, in both mainstream and advanced semiconductor process nodes.\nbuilds on our foundation of Design Excellence and deep expertise in computational algorithms and expands that expertise to include multiphysics-based analysis of systems that contain electronic devices, including printed circuit boards (“PCBs”), devices with advanced packaging technology, and 3-dimensional IC (“3D-IC”). This gives customers designing full systems containing multiple electronic devices, the ability to verify that their products will work as intended under various physical conditions. Some examples of electronic systems are a computer motherboard, the electronics in a cellphone, or the electronic transmission or infotainment system in an automobile.\nPervasive Intelligence\nincorporates AI training and inference algorithms in our solutions to help customers optimize performance and productivity with improved quality of results for their products. The amount of data produced in the design phase of their products has grown exponentially over the last 20 years. We implement generative AI agents to analyze large data sets and break through the limitations of the conventional human-intensive optimization process to achieve optimal design solutions expeditiously and without compromising accuracy.\nOur software and hardware products also support cloud access to address our customers' growing computational needs. Customers can access our solutions via our Cadence OnCloud Platform.\nOur products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative semiconductor and electronic systems that are driven by key trends, including foundries creating new advanced transistor devices and processes, semiconductor companies designing electrical systems, systems companies designing semiconductors, the hyper-convergence between electrical and mechanical systems, hyperscale computing, autonomous driving, and 5G. These trends are accelerated by the AI super cycle. Demand for our technology and expertise is driven by increasing complexity and our customers’ need to invest in new designs and products that are highly differentiated.\nGenerative AI is reshaping the entire semiconductor and systems industry development process. From our perspective, the AI super cycle we are experiencing will influence our key business opportunities along three horizons, which are Infrastructure AI, Physical AI and Life Sciences AI. The first horizon, Infrastructure AI, is being driven by data centers and hyperscale computing to provide the necessary power to run AI workloads. The second horizon, Physical AI, is the integration of AI with autonomous systems. It will drive many applications such as automobiles, industrial robots, and many other autonomous systems. The third horizon, Life Sciences AI, is the application of AI and computer science to biology to drive advancements in the medical and life sciences industries.\nUnderlying the requirements within any particular vertical sector is the availability of rapidly improving IC manufacturing technology. In order for our customers to take advantage of such advancements, some of our products need to first incorporate new capabilities such that they can exploit new manufacturing capabilities. This dependency means that we must invest significantly in product research and development (“R&D”) to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology. The demand for new IC manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products.\nAnother driver for our business is the differentiation, capabilities and benefits provided to our customers by our products. With the rapid pace of innovation comes the opportunity for our products to address growing key challenges associated with the design of electronic products, such as power consumption, performance, chip area and cost. Our products and services have differentiated attributes that our customers value. In general, these attributes can be grouped into broader categories such as quality of results (in terms of power consumption, performance and chip area), engineering productivity, tool performance, manufacturability, reliability and faster time to market. Many of these attributes contribute to sustainability initiatives by enabling our customers to create innovative products that optimize power, space and energy.\nEngineers use our solutions to complete critical steps in the design process, which includes creating, implementing, and verifying the design for functionality, manufacturability and other required industry-related compliance standards. Much of an engineer's time spent with our solutions during the design process involves running simulations to verify that their design will work as expected. Our technology, enhanced by AI, allows our customers to build a virtual model or digital twin that accurately predicts how their design will work. The ability to perform these simulations leads to significant time and cost savings for our customers as they can find and fix critical design problems before building their products. Our customers rely on our solutions to ensure their products perform safely and reliably.\nIn alignment with our Intelligent System Design strategy, we define our solutions in three product categories: Core EDA, Semiconductor IP, and System Design and Analysis (“SD&A”). Core EDA includes our software, hardware, and services used to design and verify a wide variety of semiconductors. Our Semiconductor IP portfolio includes silicon subsystems, software, and services that are used in semiconductor design. The SD&A category includes our software and services used to design and verify a wide variety of physical electronic systems. Leveraging our AI and computational software expertise, we have integrated the multiphysics domain (also known as “computational fluid dynamics,” or “CFD”) with our EDA solutions to provide customers with complete system-level design and analysis solutions. These categories are tightly integrated to provide complete design solutions for our customers.\nOur Core EDA product category addresses the design and verification for a wide variety of semiconductor chips and manufacturing process technologies. Examples of the types of chips include analog, custom, digital, mixed-signal, memory, microwave, silicon photonics, and RF. The types of devices addressed by Core EDA covers a wide range of industries including automotive, aero and defense, hyperscale computing and data center, mobile communication, medical devices, and consumer electronics. As the complexity of chip design, semiconductor process technology, and electronic system design has increased, we have been incorporating the latest advances in machine learning and generative AI to drive significant improvements for our customers’ design quality of results and engineering productivity.\nCustom IC Design and Simulation\nVirtuoso Studio is the foundation of our solution platform for custom, analog, mixed-signal, photonics, and RF semiconductors. It is a complete AI-enabled solution that integrates the key Cadence technology required for silicon design, layout, and verification. Engineers use this solution to define the chip functionality (schematic) and physical layout descriptions for the complete design of chips, advanced packaged devices, and PCBs. Designs are functionally verified in simulation with the Spectre simulation solution. We believe Spectre is the gold standard for circuit design including analog, custom, memory, silicon photonics, and RF. Pegasus Physical Verification, our physical verification solution, is fully integrated with Virtuoso.\nDigital IC Design and Signoff\nThe Innovus Implementation System is the foundation of our full-flow digital IC design and signoff solution. A typical digital full-flow solution has four primary areas, which include creating the functional description (design synthesis), performing functional verification, running the physical implementation (place and route), and performing sign-off checks for manufacturing. The Innovus Implementation System is integrated with the key full-flow solution areas. For functional design, customers use the Genus Synthesis solution. For sign-off checks, customers use the Quantus Extraction, Timing Signoff, Voltus C Power Integrity, and Pegasus Physical Verification solutions. While these are the main areas in the digital flow, there are other important technology solutions for a comprehensive flow that includes the need for test synthesis, logic equivalence checking, high level power analysis, and optimization. The solutions are Joules™ RTL Power, which is designed to deliver fast power analysis while preserving near-signoff accuracy, and Cadence Modus DFT software, which reduces system-on-chip (“SoC”) design-for-test time. Cadence Cerebrus™ is our generative AI solution that combines all elements of the full-flow IC through signoff, enabling additional productivity, automation, and improved quality of results throughout the entire design flow.\nFunctional Verification\nAs mentioned above, functional verification is an important aspect of the design process. Design engineers rely heavily on the capability to verify that the chip's functional description is equivalent to the physical description used to manufacture the silicon. Functional verification is done multiple times throughout the design process as changes are incorporated, with the objective of identifying as many potential functional issues as possible before manufacturing the circuitry, thereby significantly reducing the risk of discovering a costly error in the completed product. We offer two functional verification software solutions, the Jasper Formal Verification Platform, and the Xcelium™ Parallel Logic Simulation Platform. These software solutions help engineers compare the functional view of the design with its physical view to make sure they match and help ensure that the design will successfully pass all functional tests.\nOur hardware acceleration and software prototyping solutions address another important aspect of functional verification in design flows.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report and with Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report regarding forward-looking statements.\nis a global market leader that develops computational, AI-driven software, accelerated hardware, and IP solutions for engineers and scientists to bring new and innovative products to life. The world’s most innovative technology companies use our solutions and services to deliver transformational products to multiple industries that drive the global economy. The products these companies develop are some of the most complex systems in the world. Since our inception, we have been at the forefront of technology innovation. We work closely with our customers, helping them solve their most complex challenges in the semiconductor and electronic systems industries to unlock limitless opportunities.\nOur strategy allows us to deliver solutions to our customers to solve their most complex product development challenges. Our industry-leading computational software, specialized accelerated hardware, and IP enable us to adapt to our customer’s dynamic design requirements, allowing them to meet their critical business and environmental concerns including time-to-market and sustainability. The creation of even the most seemingly simple electronic systems and products often requires a complex design process and requires highly trained engineers with various areas of specialized knowledge and skill sets. Our ability to deliver innovative products that keep up with increasing complexity allows our customers to be successful in meeting their business goals and objectives.\nWe group our products into the following categories:\nSystem Design and Analysis.\nFor additional information about our products, see the discussion in Item 1, “Business,” under the heading “Product Categories.”\nManagement uses certain performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nConsistent with our Intelligent System Design strategy, during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed our acquisition of Invecas, a leading provider of design engineering, embedded software and system-level solutions. We believe the addition of a skilled engineering team with vast experience in delivering end-to-end system solutions with deep expertise in advanced nodes, mixed-signal, verification, embedded software, packaging and turnkey custom silicon production will enhance our ability to pursue attractive opportunities in the markets we serve. Revenue and cost of revenue associated with contracts assumed with our acquisition of Invecas is primarily classified as services revenue and cost of services in our consolidated income statements.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed our acquisition of BETA CAE, a system analysis platform provider of multi-domain, engineering simulation solutions. The acquisition of BETA CAE expands our multiphysics system analysis suite with highly complementary products, enabling us to offer a more comprehensive portfolio to customers in the automotive sector and at companies in the aerospace, industrial and healthcare industries. Revenue associated with contracts assumed with our acquisition of BETA CAE is primarily classified as product and maintenance revenue in our System Design and Analysis product category. Cost of revenue associated with these contracts is primarily classified as cost of product and maintenance in our consolidated income statements.\nMacroeconomic and Geopolitical Environment\nBecause we operate globally, our business is subject to the effects of economic downturns or recessions in the regions in which we do business, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, inflation, changing interest rates, expanded trade control laws and regulations, potential imposition of new or higher tariffs and geopolitical conflicts.\nWe have been impacted by the continued expansion of trade control laws and regulations, including certain export control restrictions concerning advanced node IC production in China, the inclusion of additional Chinese technology companies on the Bureau of Industry and Security “Entity List” and regulations governing the sale of certain technologies. Based on our current assessments, we expect the impact of these expanded trade control laws and regulations on our business to be limited. In addition, President Trump has announced the imposition of broad-based tariffs on imports from many countries, including China and Mexico. We are monitoring the imposition of these new or higher tariffs, including any pauses on the tariffs imposed, and will assess their potential impact on our business either directly, such as on our hardware business, or due to downstream effects.\nWe also continuously monitor geopolitical conflicts around the world, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, and assess their impact on our business. To date, these conflicts have not materially limited our ability to develop or support our products and have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\nWhile our business model provides some resilience against these factors, we will continue to monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these or similar circumstances on our business and financial results. For additional information on the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nResults of Operations\nResults of operations for fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, reflect the following:\nGrowth in revenue from our software, services, IP and hardware offerings;\nContinued investment in research and development activities and technical sales support, including headcount from acquisitions;\nIncremental costs for professional services; and\nIncreased interest expense from our indebtedness.\nWe primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and IP, selling or leasing our hardware products, providing maintenance for our software, hardware and IP, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our IP. The timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, hardware and IP products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time, upon completion of delivery.\nRecurring revenue includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware products, and operating leases of hardware. Recurring revenue also includes revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of other arrangements with non-cancelable commitments, whereby the customer commits to a fixed dollar amount over a specified period of time that can be used to purchase from a list of products or services.\nThe remainder of our revenue is recognized at a point in time and is characterized as up-front revenue. Up-front revenue is primarily generated by our sales of hardware products, individual IP licenses and certain software licenses. The percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue and fluctuations in revenue within our geographies in any single fiscal period are primarily impacted by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers.\nThe following table shows the percentage of our revenue that is classified as recurring or up-front for fiscal 2024 and 2023:\n\n(In millions, except percentages)\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to amortization from intangible assets acquired with our fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 acquisitions, partially offset by certain intangible assets that became fully amortized.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nWe have initiated restructuring plans in recent years, most recently in August 2024, to better align our resources with our business strategy. Restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management's estimates during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information. As a result, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. Additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. For additional information about our restructuring plans, see Note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nOperating margin represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue. Our operating margin for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was as follows:\nOperating margin decreased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to the mix of products and services sold during each respective period. In addition, our acquisitions during fiscal 2024 resulted in incremental expenses, including amortization of acquired intangibles, that exceeded incremental revenue.\nInterest expense for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was comprised of the following:\n\nCash provided by (used for) for financing activities\nCash from financing activities increased during fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to an increase in proceeds from debt, increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and stock options exercised during the period, and a decrease in repurchases of common stock. These factors were partially offset by an increase in payments on debt and payments of employee taxes on vesting of restricted stock.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources\nIn September 2024, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.200% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.300% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.700% Senior Notes due 2034 (the “2034 Notes” and together with the 2027 Notes and the 2029 Notes, the “New Notes”). Interest on the New Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in March and September of each year, beginning in March 2025. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the New Notes.\nWe used a portion of the net proceeds of the New Notes issued in September 2024 to fully prepay the outstanding principal and accrued interest of our term loan facility due on September 7, 2025 (the “2025 Term Loan”) and our term loan facility due on May 20, 2026 (the “2026 Term Loan”). In October 2024, we also settled the outstanding principal of $350.0 million and accrued interest on the 4.375% Senior Notes that were due October 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) at maturity.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn August 2024, we terminated our existing revolving credit facility, dated June 30, 2021, and amended in September 2022, and entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “2024 Credit Facility”). The 2024 Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to $1.25 billion, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $500.0 million upon receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $1.75 billion. The 2024 Credit Facility expires on August 14, 2029. Any outstanding loans drawn under the 2024 Credit Facility are due at maturity on August 14, 2029, subject to an option to extend the maturity date. Outstanding borrowings may be repaid at any time prior to maturity. Interest rates associated with the 2024 Credit Facility are variable, so interest expense is impacted by changes in the interest rates, particularly for periods when there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Interest is payable quarterly. As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants associated with such credit facility.\nFor additional information relating to our debt arrangements, see Note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nStock Repurchase Program\nWe are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock under a publicly announced program that was most recently increased by our Board of Directors in August 2023. The actual timing and amount of repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. Our repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire a minimum amount of shares, does not have an expiration date and may be modified, suspended or terminated without prior notice. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $0.8 billion of the share repurchase authorization remained available to repurchase shares of our common stock. See Part II, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for additional information on share repurchases.\nOther Liquidity Requirements\nA summary of other capital and liquidity requirements as of December 31, 2024, is as follows:\nOperating lease obligations\nPurchase obligations\nContractual interest payments\nOther long-term contractual obligations\nIncludes future payments under leases that had commenced as of December 31, 2024 as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of December 31, 2024.\nIncluded in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $55.8 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.\nWe expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our domestic and international operating activities and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions, investments and share repurchases, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in revenue recognition, the accounting for income taxes and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial",
