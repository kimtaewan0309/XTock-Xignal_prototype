MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are a global provider of critical internet infrastructure and domain name registry services, enabling internet navigation for many of the world’s most recognized domain names. We help enable the security, stability, and resiliency of the Domain Name System and the internet by providing Root Zone Maintainer Services, operating two of the thirteen global internet root servers, and providing registration services and authoritative resolution for the .\ngeneric top-level domains (“gTLDs”), which support the majority of global e-commerce.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had 171.9 million\nregistrations in the domain name base. The number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising, e-commerce, and the number of internet users, which is partially driven by greater availability of internet access, as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars. The number of domain name registrations under our management may be negatively impacted by certain factors, including overall economic conditions, competition from country code top-level domains (“ccTLDs”), other gTLDs, services that offer alternatives for an online presence, such as social media and artificial intelligence, and ongoing changes in the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses. Factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users, and how they navigate the internet, as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names, can negatively impact our business and the demand for new domain name registrations and renewals.\nBusiness Highlights and Trends\nWe recorded revenues of $419.1 million and $1,231.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, which represents an increase of 7% and 6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2024.\nWe recorded operating income of $284.3 million and $836.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, which represents an increase of 6% and 5%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had 171.9 million\nregistrations in the domain name base, which represents a 1.4% increase from September 30, 2024, and a net increase of 1.4 million domain name registrations from June 30, 2025.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, we processed 10.6 million new domain name registrations for\ncompared to 9.3 million for the same period in 2024.\n\nrenewal rate for the second quarter of 2025 was 75.5% compared to 72.7% for the second quarter of 2024.
