The analysis focuses on each issuer’s ability to service its debts in a timely fashion. Formal documentation of the analysis and our decision is prepared and approved by management. For additional details regarding our process to identify and evaluate securities with credit losses, see Item 1. “Financial Statements, Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Investments” under the caption “Allowance for Credit Loss.”\nWe would not consider a security with unrealized losses to have a decline in value due to credit when it is not our intent to sell the security, it is not more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost, which may be maturity, and we expect to recover the amortized cost basis. However, we do sell securities under certain circumstances, such as when we have evidence of a change in the issuer’s creditworthiness, when we anticipate poor relative future performance of securities, when a change in regulatory requirements modifies what constitutes a permissible investment or the maximum level of investments held or when there is an increase in capital requirements or a change in risk weights of debt securities. Sales generate both gains and losses.\nA number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit losses and determining the allowance for credit loss. These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer’s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer, (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated, (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to not sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. Any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period.\nThe net realized loss relating to the change in the allowance for credit loss and credit related sales of fixed maturities was $24.9 million and $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $34.9 million and $11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n\nActual results may differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the following: (1) adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, as well as our access to capital and cost of capital; (2) conditions in the global capital markets, including the equity, bond or real estate markets, and the economy generally may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations; (3) changes in interest rates or credit spreads or a prolonged low interest rate environment may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our net income can vary from period to period; (4) our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets and the investment returns credited to customers, which could reduce our sales, revenues, AUM and net income; (5) our valuation of investments and the determinations of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition; (6) any impairments of or valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition; (7) we may face losses on our insurance and annuity products if our actual experience differs significantly from our pricing and reserving assumptions; (8) the pattern of amortizing our DAC asset and other actuarial balances may change, impacting both the level of our DAC asset and other actuarial balances and the timing of our net income; (9) changes in laws or regulations may reduce our profitability or impact how we do business; (10) our ability to pay stockholder dividends, make share repurchases and meet our obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends or other distributions Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal Life; (11) changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition; (12) litigation and regulatory investigations may affect our financial strength or reduce our profitability; (13) from time to time, we may become subject to tax audits, tax litigation or similar proceedings, and as a result we may owe additional taxes, interest and penalties in amounts that may be material; (14) applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider in their best interests; (15) competition, including from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance, may impair our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain our profitability; (16) a downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings may increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, reduce new sales, terminate relationships with distributors, impact existing liabilities and increase our cost of capital, any of which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition; (17) client terminations or withdrawals or changes in investor preferences may lead to a reduction in revenues for our asset management and accumulation businesses; (18) guarantees within certain of our products that protect policyholders may decrease our net income or increase the volatility of our results of operations or financial position under U.S. GAAP if our hedging or risk management strategies prove ineffective or insufficient; (19) our international businesses face political, legal, operational and other risks that could reduce our profitability in those businesses; (20) we face risks arising from fraudulent activities; (21) we face risks arising from our participation in joint ventures; (22) we may need to fund deficiencies in our Closed Block assets; (23) our reinsurers could default on their obligations or increase their rates, which could adversely impact our net income and financial condition; (24) we face risks arising from future acquisitions of businesses; (25) we face risks in administering coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements; (26) a pandemic, terrorist attack, military action or other catastrophic event could adversely affect our operations, net income or financial condition; (27) our financial results may be adversely impacted by global climate changes; (28) technological and societal changes may disrupt our business model and impair our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain our profitability; (29) damage to our reputation may adversely affect our revenues and profitability; (30) we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims; (31) if we are unable to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and sales representatives and develop new distribution sources, our results of operations, financial condition, strategic growth commitments and sales of our products may be adversely impacted; (32) interruptions in information technology, infrastructure or other internal or external systems used for our business operations, or a failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data residing on such systems, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and adversely impact our profitability; (33) loss of or disruption in key vendor relationships and services or failure of a vendor to protect information of our customers or employees could adversely affect our business or result in losses and (34) our enterprise risk management framework may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating all the risks to which we are exposed.\n\nWe provide financial products and services through the following reportable segments:\nRetirement and Income Solutions provides retirement and related financial products and services primarily to businesses, their employees, and other individuals.
