See Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements,” Note 13, “Borrowing Arrangements,” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our covenant requirements and additional information with respect to the 2025 Credit Agreement. If we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants under the 2025 Credit Agreement, we will not be able to draw on our revolving credit facility. Additionally, as of November 26, 2025, we have no amounts outstanding under the 2025 Credit Agreement.\nAs of October 31, 2025, we have $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding. See Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements,” Note 13, “Borrowing Arrangements,” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally. Our primary commercial banking relationship is with Citigroup and its global affiliates. In addition, Citibank N.A., an affiliate of Citigroup, is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.\nOur cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world, with substantial amounts held outside of the United States. As of October 31, 2025, approximately 56% of our total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs. There are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances, such as foreign exchange restrictions, foreign regulatory restrictions, or adverse tax costs. Earnings in foreign jurisdictions are generally available for distribution to the United States with little to no incremental U.S. taxes. We regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed. We expect to meet our liquidity needs through or in combination of current cash balances, ongoing cash flows, and external borrowings.\nCash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part II, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” Based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operations, and our available revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOur revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy. See Part I, Item 3, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for further discussion.\nNine Months Ended October 31,\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $1,463 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, primarily consisted of $808 million of our net income adjusted for $1,413 million non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, restructuring, other exit costs, and facility reductions, amortization of costs to obtain a contract with a customer, depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense, and deferred income tax offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to a negative change in prepaid expenses and other assets of $819 million, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $286 million due to the timing of our billing installments and seasonality of billings in the fourth fiscal quarter, partially offset by the change in accounts receivable of $202 million due to the seasonality of our billings in the fourth fiscal quarter and timing of cash collections from customers.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $915 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, primarily consisted of $809 million of our net income adjusted for $700 million non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization of costs to obtain a contract with a customer, depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense, and deferred income tax. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue of $612 million due to the timing of our billing installments and seasonality of billings in the fourth fiscal quarter and a negative change in prepaid expenses and other assets of $221 million partially offset by the change in accounts receivable of $177 million due to the seasonality of our billings in the fourth fiscal quarter and timing of cash collections from customers.\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRPO represents deferred revenue and contractually stated or committed contracts under early renewal and multi-year billing plans for subscription, services, license, and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not yet been recognized. Unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements,” Note 3, “Revenue Recognition,” for more details on Autodesk's performance obligations.\nUnbilled deferred revenue\nRPO\nRPO consisted of the following:\nRPO\nWe expect that the amount of RPO will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration, and size of customer subscription and support agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, and foreign currency fluctuations. Historically, we have had increased EBA sales activity in our fourth fiscal quarter and this seasonality may affect the relative value of our billings, RPO, and collections in the fourth and first fiscal quarters. As customers continue to transition from multi-year subscription contracts billed upfront to annual billing installments, some customers may choose annual contracts instead. If this were to occur, we would expect it to proportionately reduce the unbilled portion of our total remaining performance obligations and would expect it to impact total RPO growth rates negatively. Deferred revenue, billings, current RPO, revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow would remain broadly unchanged in this scenario.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Items\nAt October 31, 2025, we had $2.59 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our cash flow from operations increased to $1.46 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, compared to $915 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2024. We repurchased 3 million shares of our common stock for $1.07 billion during the nine months ended October 31, 2025. Comparatively, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $443 million during the nine months ended October 31, 2024. See further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nResults of Operations\nWe believe our investment in cloud products and a subscription business model, backed by a strong balance sheet, give us a robust foundation to successfully navigate complex geopolitical and global macro-economic challenges. However, material scarcity, supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, a global labor shortage, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, economic and regulatory uncertainty, the potential for global trade wars, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, may impact our outlook. We also expect our continued transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts to impact the timing of our billings and cash collections. The extent of the impact of these risks on our business in remaining fiscal 2026 and beyond will depend on several factors, some of which are out of our control. Further discussion of the potential impacts of these risks on our business can be found in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\n\nOur subscription plans represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. Our cloud offerings, for example, Autodesk Construction Cloud, Autodesk Build, Fusion, Flow Production Tracking, Autodesk Forma, AutoCAD web app, and AutoCAD mobile app, provide tools, including mobile and collaboration capabilities, to streamline design, collaboration, building and manufacturing, and data management processes.
