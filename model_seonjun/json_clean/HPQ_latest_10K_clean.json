We compete on the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service, support and solutions including subscription-based offerings and financing, security, availability of application software, and our sustainable impact.\nThe markets for each of our key business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively based on the factors listed above. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.\nThe competitive environment in which each key segment operates is described below:\nThe markets in which Personal Systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition and introduction of new products and solutions. Our primary competitors are Acer Inc., Apple Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Dell Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Lenovo Group Limited, Logitech International S.A., Microsoft Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation. In certain geographies, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or “white box” manufacturers. Our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio, our innovation, and research and development capabilities including security features, our innovative design work, our brand and procurement leverage, our ability to cross-sell our portfolio of offerings, our extensive service and support offerings, the accessibility of our products and the execution of our broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.\nThe markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive. Printing’s key customer segments each face competitive market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products. Our primary competitors include Brother Industries, Ltd., Canon Inc., Lexmark International, Inc., Pantum, Seiko Epson Corporation, The Ricoh Company Ltd., and Xerox Corporation Ltd. In addition, independent suppliers offer non-original supplies (including imitation, refill and remanufactured alternatives), which are often available for lower prices, but which can also offer lower print quality and reliability compared to HP original inkjet and toner supplies. These and other competing products are often sold alongside our products through online or omnichannel resellers,\n\nretailers or distributors, or such resellers, retailers and distributors may highlight the availability of lower cost non-original supplies. Our competitive advantages include our comprehensive high-quality solutions for the home, office and publishing environments, our innovation, and research and development capabilities including security features, sustainability, our brand, and the accessibility of our products through a broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.\nSales, Marketing and Distribution\nWe manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above. Our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups, and purchases of HP products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by HP or indirectly through a variety of partners, utilizing their own physical or internet stores or an omnichannel combination of the two, including:\nretailers that sell our products to the public focusing on consumers and SMBs;\nresellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer groups;\ndistribution partners that supply our products and solutions to resellers and retailers in certain geographies; and\nsystem integrators and other business intermediaries that provide various levels of services, including systems integration work and as-a-service solutions, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our products and services.\nThe mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel sales differs by business and geographic market. We believe that customer buying patterns and different geographic market conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing and distribution efforts to the geographic market and sub-geographic specificities for each of our businesses. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our market coverage while identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect routes to market. Our businesses collaborate to accomplish strategic and process alignment where appropriate. For example, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise and drives both direct and indirect sales to their assigned customers. For other customers and for consumers, we typically manage both direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers mainly targeting consumers and SMBs and commercial resellers mainly targeting SMBs, mid-market accounts, public sector and large enterprises.\nManufacturing and Materials\nWe utilize outsourced manufacturers (“OMs”) around the world to manufacture HP-designed products to generate cost efficiencies, reduce time to market, and maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes. We also manufacture finished products from components and sub-assemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors.\nWe utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. Building products to order maximizes manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables products to match a customer’s hardware and software customization requirements.\nLike other participants in the information technology (“IT”) industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. We also may acquire component inventory in times of growth or in anticipation of significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources. Additionally, while most of our products have existing or readily available alternative sources of supply, some of ",

Services net revenue includes revenue from our service offerings and support on hardware devices.\nIn fiscal year 2024, total net revenue decreased 0.3% (decreased 0.2% on a constant currency basis) as compared to the prior-year period. Net revenue from the United States decreased 0.2% and remained at $18.8 billion, and outside of the United States decreased 0.3% to $34.8 billion. The decrease in products net revenue was primarily driven by lower hardware units in Printing and competitive pricing in Printer hardware and Personal Systems, partially offset by market recovery in Commercial PS and higher net revenue in key growth areas. Services net revenue remained flat.\nA detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included under “Segment Information” below.\nIn fiscal year 2024, gross margin increased by 0.7 percentage points, primarily driven by products gross margin due to lower supply chain costs, and cost savings, including Future Ready transformation savings, partially offset by competitive pricing in Printer hardware and Personal Systems, and mix shifts towards Personal Systems while services gross margin decreased.\nA detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under “Segment Information” below.\nResearch and development (“R&D”)\nR&D expense increased 3.9% in fiscal year 2024, primarily due to continued investments in innovation, partially offset by disciplined cost management including Future Ready transformation savings.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)\nSG&A expense increased 5.6% in fiscal year 2024, primarily due to higher litigation costs and go-to-market initiatives, partially offset by disciplined cost management including Future Ready transformation savings.\nRestructuring and other charges\nRestructuring and other charges relate primarily to the Fiscal 2023 Plan. For more information, see Note 3, “Restructuring and Other Charges”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nAcquisition and divestiture charges\nAcquisition and divestiture charges primarily include direct third-party professional and legal fees, and integration and divestiture-related costs, as well as non-cash adjustments to the fair value of certain acquired assets such as inventory and certain compensation charges related to cash settlement of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units from acquisitions. Acquisition and divestiture charges decreased by $157 million in the fiscal year 2024, primarily due to reduced integration activities associated with the fiscal year 2022 Poly acquisition.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal year 2024 and relates to intangible assets resulting from acquisitions.\nInterest and other, net\nInterest and other, net increased $20 million in the fiscal year 2024 primarily due to the net gain on extinguishment of debt as well as retirement benefits associated with our Enhanced Early Retirement (“EER”) program recorded in the prior year period, partially offset by lower interest expense on debt.\nOur effective tax rate was 15.4% in fiscal year 2024. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to impacts of changes in valuation allowances and favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from HP’s operations in lower-tax jurisdictions throughout the world.\nFor a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% in fiscal year 2024, and further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn fiscal year 2024, we recorded $214 million of net income tax benefits related to non-recurring items in the provision for taxes. This amount included $198 million related to changes in valuation allowances, $60 million related to restructuring charges, $14 million related to the filing of tax returns in various jurisdictions, and $11 million related to acquisition charges. These benefits were partially offset by $39 million of uncertain tax position charges and $25 million related to changes in tax rates.\nIn December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”) introduced model rules for a global minimum tax framework known as (“BEPS Pillar Two”). Numerous governments worldwide have enacted or are in the process of enacting legislation to implement this framework. Where applicable, these rules will take effect for us beginning in the fiscal year 2025 and we plan to treat the tax as a period cost. We do not anticipate a material impact on our effective tax rate or cash tax payments in these jurisdictions for fiscal year 2025. Our assessment for subsequent fiscal years may be influenced by additional legislative guidance and the enactment of further provisions within the BEPS Pillar Two framework.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, HP realigned its business unit financial reporting more closely with its customer market segmentation. Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed. For more information on our segments see Note 2, “Segment Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nTotal Personal Systems\nWeighted Net Revenue Change Percentage Points measures contribution of each business unit towards overall segment revenue growth. It is calculated by dividing the change in revenue of each business unit from the prior-year period by total segment revenue for the prior-year period.\nFiscal year 2024 compared with fiscal year 2023\nPersonal Systems net revenue increased 1.4% (increased 1.3% on a constant currency basis) in the fiscal year 2024, as compared to the prior-year period. The net revenue increase was primarily due to a 3.3% increase in PC unit volume driven by Commercial PS, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in average selling price (“ASPs”). The decrease in ASPs is primarily due to competitive pricing, partially offset by favorable mix shifts.\nCommercial PS revenue increased 3.1% primarily driven by a 5.7% increase in units due to market recovery, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in ASPs. The decrease in ASPs was driven by unfavorable mix shifts and competitive pricing.\nConsumer PS net revenue decreased 2.4% driven by a 2.5% decrease in ASPs and a 0.3% decrease in units due to demand softness, especially in China. The decrease in ASPs was driven by competitive pricing and unfavorable mix shifts, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts.\nPersonal Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.1 percentage points driven by an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. Gross margin increased primarily due to lower supply chain cost, favorable mix shifts as well as Future Ready transformation savings, partially offset by competitive pricing. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to higher litigation costs, go-to-market initiatives and continued investments in innovation, partially offset by disciplined cost management including Future Ready transformation savings.\n\nITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nHP delivers innovative and sustainable devices, services, and subscriptions for personal computing, printing, 3D printing, hybrid work, gaming and other related technologies. We have three reportable segments: Personal Systems, Printing, and Corporate Investments.

We are consolidating all our software resources under the Technology and Innovation Organization to evolve from a transactional hardware company to a more experience-led organization, further strengthening our ability to capture these opportunities.\nWe continue to experience challenges that are representative of the trends and uncertainties that may affect our industry, generally, and our business and financial results, specifically, and we expect these challenges to continue in the short-term. One set of challenges relates to the current macroeconomic environment and the adverse impact on demand for certain of our products. A second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution in an evolving distribution and reseller landscape, with increasing online and omnichannel presence. Specific challenges we face at the segment level are set forth below.\nIn Personal Systems, we face challenges with a competitive pricing environment, variability in commodity costs, and demand softness in certain geographic regions.\nIn Printing, we face challenges from changing customer behaviors as well as competitors with a favorable foreign currency environment and non-original supplies (which includes imitation, refill, or remanufactured alternatives). We also obtain many Printing components from single source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality, or other considerations.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nTo address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners. In addition, we continue to work on improving our operations and adapting our business models, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes, analytics, efficiencies and simplification of our product portfolio. We also continue to work on optimizing our sales coverage models, aligning our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improving channel execution and inventory, production and backlog management, strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, effective cost management, strengthening our pricing strategy, and developing and capitalizing on market opportunities.\nMacroeconomic Environment\nOur business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. We face global macroeconomic challenges such as ongoing geopolitical conflicts (including the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and tensions in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea), uncertainty in the markets, volatility in exchange rates, inflationary trends and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment. We also experience seasonality in the sale of our products and services which may be affected by general economic conditions.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we experienced continued industry wide demand softness in Printing and a competitive pricing environment, particularly from our Japanese competitors benefiting from a favorable foreign currency environment. In Personal Systems, we faced a competitive pricing environment, variability in commodity costs, and demand softness in certain regions. We experienced gradual market recovery in Commercial PS resulting in overall PC unit growth in fiscal year 2024 and net revenue growth in Personal Systems in the second half of fiscal year 2024.\nTransformation Update\nIn November 2022, we announced our Future Ready Plan (the “Fiscal 2023 Plan” or “Future Ready”) to become a more digitally enabled company, focus investments on key growth opportunities and simplify our operating model. The Fiscal 2023 Plan is expected to run through end of fiscal 2025. The three key elements of our Fiscal 2023 Plan are digital transformation, portfolio optimization, and operational efficiency. We accelerated our cumulative savings target ",
