MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide material information relevant to an assessment of Danaher Corporation’s (“Danaher,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. The MD&A is designed to focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. This includes descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations, as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management’s assessment to have a material impact on future operations. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:\nInformation Relating to Forward-Looking Statements\nResults of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nINFORMATION RELATING TO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from the results, developments and business decisions contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Important factors, risks and uncertainties that in the\nfuture could cause actual results to differ materially from those envisaged in the forward-looking statements, and that in some cases have affected us in the past, include the following:\nBusiness and Strategic Risks\nConditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets (including economic impacts from the U.S. government shutdown that began in October 2025) can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce the prices we charge.\nOur growth depends on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation. Our growth also suffers when the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.\nThe healthcare industry and related industries that we serve are undergoing significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, which can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nEconomic, political, geopolitical, legal, compliance, social and business factors (including the impact of military conflicts), both in the U.S. and outside the U.S., can negatively affect our business and financial statements. For example, elections can result in significant political shifts and/or disruptions, and the 2025 change in the U.S. administration as well as recent Supreme Court decisions have resulted in policy, regulatory and economic changes, challenges and uncertainty, including with respect to tariffs and healthcare-related topics. Delays in National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) funding related to the U.S. government shutdown that commenced in October 2025 may also negatively affect our business and financial statements.\nUncertainties with respect to the development, deployment and use of artificial intelligence in our business and products may result in harm to our business and reputation.\nGlobal heath crises, pandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks can adversely impact certain elements of our business and financial statements.\nBusiness partners and other third-parties we rely on for development, supply and/or marketing of certain products, potential products and technologies could fail to perform sufficiently.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Investment Risks\nThe inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and appropriate prices, realize the economic benefits of consummated acquisitions or to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, can negatively impact our business. Our acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and other strategic relationships can also negatively impact our business and financial statements and our indemnification rights may not fully protect us from liabilities related thereto.\nDivestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have previously disposed could adversely affect our business and financial statements. For example, we could incur significant liability if any of the split-off or spin-off transactions we have previously consummated are determined to be a taxable transaction or otherwise pursuant to our indemnification obligations with respect to such transactions.\nSignificant disruptions in, or breaches in security of, our information technology (“IT”) systems or data; data privacy violations; other losses or disruptions to facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or IT systems due to catastrophe; and labor disputes can all adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nDefects, manufacturing problems and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services, or allegations thereof, can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nClimate change, legal or regulatory measures to address climate change and other sustainability topics and any inability to address regulatory requirements or stakeholder expectations with respect to climate change and other sustainability topics, may negatively affect our business and financial statements.\nOur financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of the supplies we use in, and the labor we need for, our operations, as well as adverse changes with respect to key distributors and channel partners.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate talented employees.\nOur restructuring actions can have long-term adverse effects on our business and financial statements.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nAny inability to adequately protect or avoid third-party infringement of our intellectual property, and third-party claims we are infringing intellectual property rights, can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nThe U.S. government has certain rights with respect to incremental production capacity attributable to, and/or the intellectual property we have developed using, government financing. In addition, in times of national emergency the U.S. government could also control our allocation of manufacturing capacity.\nFinancial and Tax Risks\nFrom time to time our outstanding debt has increased significantly as a result of acquisitions and other factors, and we may incur additional debt. Such indebtedness may limit our operations and use of cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings; and failure to comply with our indebtedness-related covenants could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nOur business and financial statements can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our tax rates (including as a result of changes in tax laws) or income tax liabilities/assessments, the outcome of tax audits, recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other intangible assets and fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities.\nLegal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational Risks\nSignificant developments or changes in national laws or policies to protect or promote domestic interests and/or address foreign competition can have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation (including those applicable to the healthcare industry). Failure to comply with those regulations (including by our employees, agents or business partners) or significant developments or changes in U.S. or non-U.S. laws or policies can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nWe are subject to, or otherwise responsible for, a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nWith respect to the regulated medical devices we offer, product introductions or modifications can require regulatory clearance or authorizations and we can be required to recall or cease marketing such products; off-label marketing can result in penalties; and clinical trials can have results that are unexpected or are perceived unfavorably by the market, all of which can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nOur operations, products and services also expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nOur By-law exclusive forum provisions could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose their preferred judicial forum for disputes.\nSee “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors” of the Company’s 2024 Annual Report and Part II-Item 1A of this report for further discussion regarding reasons that actual results may differ materially from the results, developments and business decisions contemplated by our forward-looking statements.
