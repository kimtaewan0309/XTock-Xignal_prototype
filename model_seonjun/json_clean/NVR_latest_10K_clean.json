  "item1_clean": "NVR, Inc., a Virginia corporation, was formed in 1980 as NVHomes, Inc. Our primary business is the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings, all of which are primarily constructed on a pre-sold basis. To more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations, we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business. We conduct our homebuilding activities directly. Our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary, NVR Mortgage Finance, Inc. (“NVRM”). Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “NVR”, “we”, “us” or “our” include NVR, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nWe are one of the largest homebuilders in the United States. We operate in thirty-six metropolitan areas in sixteen states, and Washington, D.C. Our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings under three trade names: Ryan Homes, NVHomes and Heartland Homes. Our Ryan Homes product is marketed primarily to first-time and first-time move-up buyers. Ryan Homes operates in thirty-six metropolitan areas located in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, Indiana, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Kentucky. Our NVHomes and Heartland Homes products are marketed primarily to move-up and luxury buyers. NVHomes operates in Delaware, New Jersey, and the Washington, D.C., Baltimore, MD and Philadelphia, PA metropolitan areas. Heartland Homes operates in the Pittsburgh, PA metropolitan area.\nWe generally do not engage in land development (see discussion below of our land development activities). Instead, we typically acquire finished building lots from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price finished lot purchase agreements (“LPAs”) that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the LPAs. The deposits required under the LPAs are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and typically range up to 10% of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots.\nWe believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development. We may, at our option, choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these LPAs by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract. Our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these LPAs is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the LPAs. We do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these LPAs. None of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these LPAs have recourse to our general credit. We generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our five-year business plan.\nWe provide a number of mortgage and title-related services through our mortgage banking operations. Through operations in each of our homebuilding markets, NVRM originates mortgage loans exclusively for our homebuyers. NVRM generates revenues primarily from origination fees, gains on sales of loans and title fees. NVRM sells the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets primarily on a servicing released basis.\nSegment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in Note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe offer single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominiums with many different home designs. These home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options. Our homes combine traditional, transitional, cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities, generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1,000 to 9,000 finished square feet. During 2024, the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately $190,000 to $2.3 million. The average price of homes settled was $450,700 in both 2024 and 2023.\nOur four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions:\n\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, Georgia and Kentucky\nWe utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes. We use many independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors.\nOur preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many built-in options and a landscaped lot. The garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review. Sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis.\nWe and our subcontractors must comply with various federal, state and local zoning, building, environmental, advertising and consumer credit statutes, rules and regulations, as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities. All of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products, and in some instances, have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us. Counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards. In addition, our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. To date, restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities.\nCompetition and Market Factors\nThe housing industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater financial resources than we do. We also face competition from the home resale market. Our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service and reputation. Historically, we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes.\nWe provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations. Our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches for which they receive commissions and fees. Because NVRM originates mortgage loans exclusively for our homebuilding customers, NVRM is dependent on our homebuilding segment. In 2024, NVRM closed approximately 17,300 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $6.3 billion as compared to approximately 15,900 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $5.7 billion in 2023. NVRM’s mortgage loans in process that had not closed had an aggregate principal balance of approximately $2.9 billion as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNVRM sells the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets primarily on a servicing released basis, typically within 30 days from the loan closing. NVRM is an approved seller/servicer for Fannie Mae (“FNMA”) and Freddie Mac (\"FHLMC\") mortgage loans and an approved seller/issuer/servicer of Ginnie Mae (“GNMA”), Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) and Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) mortgage loans.\nNVRM is subject to the rules and regulations of FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC, VA and FHA. These rules and regulations restrict certain activities of NVRM. NVRM is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs. In addition, NVRM is subject to regulation at the state and federal level, including regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) with respect to specific origination, selling and servicing practices.\nCompetition and Market Factors\nNVRM’s main competition comes from national, regional, and local mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, credit unions and banks in each of these markets. NVRM competes primarily on the basis of customer service, variety of products offered, interest rates offered, prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 7,000 full time employees, of whom approximately 5,930 worked in our homebuilding operations, and approximately 1,070 worked in our mortgage banking operations, compared to December 31, 2023, when we had approximately 6,300 full time employees, of whom approximately 5,300 worked in our homebuilding operations, and approximately 1,000 worked in our mortgage banking operations. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nOur employees are our most important asset. We are committed to continually developing an inclusive culture that attracts a diverse workforce and enables them to contribute to the success of the company by emphasizing their unique perspectives and backgrounds. All of our employees must adhere to our code of ethics and standards of business conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior in the workplace. Our compensation philosophy has been consistent for 30 years and is designed to motivate and retain highly qualified and experienced employees.\n\nOur principal website can be found at\nOur website also includes a corporate governance section which contains our Corporate Governance Guidelines (which includes our Directors’ Independence Standards), Code of Ethics and Standards of Business Conduct, Board Committee Charters, Policies and Procedures for the Consideration of Board of Director Candidates, and Policies and Procedures Regarding Communications with the NVR, Inc. Board of Directors, the Independent Lead Director and the Non-Management Directors as a Group.\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nWe provide tools for the advancement of our employees by offering training and development opportunities that align with each employee’s responsibilities and career path. We strive to promote employees from within our workforce, as we believe this provides both long-term success and continuity to our operations and growth for our employees. Our focus is demonstrated by the tenure of our executives and our regional and division leaders.\nAvailable Information",
  "item7_clean": "Gross profit margin percentage\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nAverage new order price\nAverage settlement price\nAverage backlog price\nNew order cancellation rate\nConsolidated Homebuilding\nHomebuilding revenues increased 11% in 2024 compared to 2023, as a result of an 11% increase in the number of units settled. The increase in the number of units settled was primarily attributable to a 12% higher backlog unit balance entering 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, coupled with a higher backlog turnover rate. The gross profit margin percentage in 2024 decreased to 23.7% from 24.3% in 2023\nGross profit margins were negatively impacted by higher lot costs and closing cost assistance.\nNew Orders and the average sales price of New Orders increased 4% and 2%, respectively, in 2024 when compared to 2023, despite the number of active communities remaining flat year over year. New Orders were higher year over year due to improved demand in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, attributable to a limited supply of homes in the resale market and stabilized mortgage interest rates. However, demand began to slow in the fourth quarter, primarily in our South East segment as affordability was negatively impacted in part by rising mortgage interest rates and by an increase in the supply of homes in the resale and new home markets within certain markets in our South East segment. The increase in the average sales price of New Orders is primarily attributable to a relative shift to higher priced markets and communities in certain of our reportable segments as discussed in the respective segments below.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses in 2024 increased by approximately $9,200 compared to 2023, and as a percentage of revenue decreased to 5.8% in 2024 from 6.3% in 2023. The increase in SG&A expense was due primarily to an increase of approximately $21,000 in personnel costs attributable to an increase in headcount year over year. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses were approximately $9,600 higher year over year due to an increase in model home related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $24,000 decrease in equity-based compensation year over year due primarily to the non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of NVR common stock (\"Options\") and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") issued as part of the 2018 four-year block grant being fully vested as of December 31, 2023.\nOur backlog represents homes sold but not yet settled with our customers. As of December 31, 2024, our backlog decreased on a unit basis by 3% to 9,953 units, but increased on a dollar basis by 1% to $4,791,870 when compared to 10,229 units and $4,756,926, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in backlog units was attributable to a higher backlog turnover rate year over year as the number of units settled exceeded New Orders year over year. Backlog dollars were higher primarily due to a 4% increase in the average price of units in backlog year over year, primarily attributable to a relative shift to higher priced markets and communities in certain of our reportable segments.\nThe rate at which we turn over our backlog is impacted by various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in New Order activity, internal production capacity, external subcontractor capacity, building material availability and other external factors over which we do not exercise control.\nReportable Homebuilding Segments\nHomebuilding segment profit includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes, less the cost of homes sold, SG&A expenses, and a corporate capital allocation charge determined by corporate management. The corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation and is based on the segment’s average net assets employed. The corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the Chief Operating Decision Maker to determine whether the operating segment is providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital.\nWe record impairment charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired. For segment reporting purposes, impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the termination of an LPA with the developer, or the restructuring of an LPA resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit. We evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter. For presentation purposes below, the contract land deposit impairment allowance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 has been allocated to the reportable segments for the respective years to show contract land deposits on a net basis. The net contract land deposit balances below also include approximately $8,700 and $7,700 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash.\nThe following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years:\nSelected Segment Financial Data:\n\nOur consolidated effective tax rates in 2024 and 2023 were 20.50% and 17.46%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a lower income tax benefit recognized for excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, which totaled approximately $95,100 and $153,600 for 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe expect continued tax rate volatility in future years attributable to the recognition of excess tax benefits from equity plan activity and distributions from the deferred compensation plans. Given the limited number of participants in our deferred compensation plan, the retirement of a participant could result in a significant distribution of the rabbi trust shares and corresponding tax deduction for the Company.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption\nSee Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to us.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe fund our operations primarily from our current cash holdings and cash flows generated by operating activities. In addition, we have available a short-term unsecured working capital revolving credit facility and revolving mortgage repurchase facility, as further described below. As of December 31, 2024, we had a strong liquidity position with approximately $2,500,000 in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $285,000 in unused committed capacity under our revolving credit facility and $150,000 in unused committed capacity under our revolving mortgage repurchase facility. We believe that our current cash holdings and our anticipated cash flows generated by operating activities, together with the amounts under our revolving credit facility and revolving mortgage repurchase facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operations for at least the next twelve months and beyond.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe believe that our current cash holdings, cash generated from operations, and cash available under our short-term unsecured credit agreement and revolving mortgage repurchase facility, as well as the public debt and equity markets, will be sufficient to satisfy both our short-term and long-term cash requirements for working capital to support our daily operations and meet commitments under our contractual obligations with third parties. Our material contractual obligations primarily consist of the following:\n(i) Payments due to service our debt and interest on that debt. Our current outstanding Senior Notes total $900,000 and mature in May 2030. Future interest payments on our current outstanding Senior Notes total approximately $145,050, with $27,000 due within the next twelve months.\n(ii) Payment obligations totaling approximately $584,500 under existing LPAs for deposits to be paid to land developers, assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers and we exercise our option to acquire finished lots under those LPAs. We expect to make the majority of these payments within the next three years.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a total of $900,000 in outstanding Senior Notes which mature in May 2030. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, will rank senior in right of payment to any of our future indebtedness that is by its terms expressly subordinated to the Senior Notes and will be effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The indenture governing the Senior Notes does not contain any financial covenants; however, it does contain, among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, covenants that restrict our ability to create, incur, assume or guarantee secured debt, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers and/or the sale of assets. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Notes as of December 31, 2024.\nWe have an unsecured revolving credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with a group of lenders which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of $300,000 (the \"Facility\"). Under the Credit Agreement, we may request increases of up to $300,000 to the Facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for a $100,000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which there was approximately $14,600 outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The Credit Agreement termination date is February 12, 2026. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.\nRepurchase Agreement\nOur mortgage banking subsidiary, NVRM, has an unsecured revolving mortgage repurchase agreement (the \"Repurchase Agreement\") which is non-recourse to NVR. The purpose of the Repurchase Agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by NVRM. The Repurchase Agreement provides borrowing capacity up to $150,000, subject to certain sublimits. The Repurchase Agreement expires on July 14, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, there was no debt outstanding under the Repurchase Agreement and there were no borrowing base limitations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents decreased by $550,777. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,374,462, due primarily to cash provided by earnings in 2024. Cash was primarily used to fund the increase in contract land deposits of $157,291 attributable to an increase in the number of lots under control as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, and net mortgage loan activity of $105,790. Additional cash was used to fund the increase in inventory of $108,557 attributable to an increase in units under construction year over year.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2024 was $26,553. Cash was used primarily for purchases of property, plant and equipment of $29,212.\nNet cash used by financing activities in 2024 was $1,898,686. Cash was used primarily to repurchase 256,871 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $2,057,677 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program, discussed above. Cash was provided from stock option exercise proceeds totaling $161,625.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents increased by $640,926. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,497,993, due primarily to cash provided by earnings in 2023 and net cash proceeds of $46,136 from mortgage loan activity. Cash was primarily used to fund the increase in inventory of $161,875 attributable to an increase in units under construction as of December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2023 was $24,100. Cash was used primarily for purchases of property, plant and equipment of $24,877.\nNet cash used by financing activities in 2023 was $832,967. Cash was used primarily to repurchase 181,499 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $1,081,815 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program, discussed above. Cash was provided from stock option exercise proceeds totaling $250,509.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, restricted cash totaled $53,692 and $52,550, respectively. Restricted cash was attributable to customer deposits for certain home sales and cash collected from customers for loans in process and closed mortgage loans held for sale.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management.\nHomebuilding Inventory\nThe carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units. Field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs. Interest costs are not capitalized into inventory, with the exception of land under development and joint venture investments, as applicable. Upon settlement, the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis. Cost of building materials is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\nSold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual sales price compared to the total estimated cost to construct. Unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sales prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete. Any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in cost of sales.\nContract Land Deposits\nWe purchase finished lots under LPAs that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract. The deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots.\nWe maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period. To analyze contract land deposit impairments, we conduct a loss contingency analysis each quarter. In addition to considering market and economic conditions, we assess contract land deposit impairments on a community-by-community basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms, analyzing quantitative and qualitative information including, as applicable, current sales absorption levels, recent sales’ profit margin, the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots, a developer’s performance, a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices, if necessary, and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default.\nOur analysis is focused on wheth",
