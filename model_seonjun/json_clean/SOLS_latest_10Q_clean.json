The proceeds of the Notes were held in escrow pending completion of the Spin-off, and such proceeds were released from escrow on October 29, 2025 in connection with the Spin-off.\nThe Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Solstice, guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of its domestic subsidiaries and, from and after the escrow release date, will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of Solstice’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Company’s Senior Credit Facilities (described below). The Notes are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants that limit the Company’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock and make other restricted payments; make investments; consummate certain asset sales; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; grant or assume certain liens; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn October 29, 2025, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for (i) a seven-year senior secured first-lien term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion (the “Term Loan Facility”) and (ii) a five-year senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $1.0 billion (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facilities”).\nThe Company also entered into uncommitted bilateral letter of credit agreements, which provide for uncommitted bilateral letter of credit facilities in an aggregate uncommitted amount of $750 million (the “Sidecar LC Facilities”, and together with the Credit Facilities, the “Senior Credit Facilities”).\nAll obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by: (a) the Company and (b) all direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company that are organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, subject to certain exceptions and limitations (collectively, the “Guarantors”). Subject to certain limitations, the Senior Credit Facilities are secured on a first priority basis by: (x) a perfected security interest in the equity interests of each direct subsidiary of the Company and each Guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities (subject to certain customary exceptions) and (y) perfected security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material real property of the Company and each of the Guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities, subject, in each case, to certain exceptions.\nThe Credit Facilities are subject to an interest rate, at the Company’s option, of either (a) base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the “prime rate” in the\nUnited States, (2) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.5% and (3) the one month adjusted SOFR rate, plus 1.00% per annum (“ABR”) or (b) an adjusted SOFR rate (“SOFR”) (which shall not be less than zero).\nThe applicable margin for the Term Loan Facility is 1.75% per annum (for SOFR loans) and 0.75% per annum (for ABR loans). The applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility varies from 1.50% per annum to 2.00% per annum (for SOFR loans) and 0.50% to 1.00% per annum (for ABR loans) based on the Company’s Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Accordingly, the interest rates for the Credit Facilities will fluctuate during the term of the Credit Agreement based on changes in the ABR, SOFR or future changes in the Company’s Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio. Interest payments with respect to the Credit Facilities are required either on a quarterly basis (for ABR loans) or at the end of each interest period (for SOFR loans) or, if the duration of the applicable interest period exceeds three months, then every three months.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which is determined by the Company’s Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio and ranges from 0.25% to 0.35% per annum.\nThe Company may voluntarily prepay borrowings under the Credit Agreement without premium or penalty, subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium in connection with certain repricing transactions with respect to the Term Loan Facility in the first six months after the effective date of the Credit Agreement and customary “breakage” costs with respect to SOFR loans. The Company may also reduce the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, in whole or in part, in each case, subject to certain minimum amounts and increments.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things, limit the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, to make certain fundamental changes, enter into restrictive agreements, to make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, to prepay certain indebtedness and to pay dividends, to make other distributions or redemptions/repurchases, in respect of the Company and its subsidiaries’ equity interests, to engage in transactions with affiliates or amend certain material documents. In addition, the Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants for the benefit of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility requiring the maintenance of a Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 (with a temporary step-up following a material acquisition to 4.00 to 1.00), and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.75 to 1.00.\nThe Sidecar LC Facilities provide for maintenance fees which accrue per annum on the aggregate amount of any letter of credit outstanding thereunder, payable quarterly, and fees which range from 0.60% to 0.95%, depending on the issuer and the type of letter of credit. In addition to the maintenance fee, Sidecar LC Facilities also provide for each issuer’s standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any letter of credit.\nSummarized cash flow information for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 is as follows:\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $289 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $567 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was due to lower net income and greater working\ncapital outflow, in particular due to higher accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by inflows of deferred revenue as well as increased payables related to purchased services and direct material spend and timing.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $228 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $204 million in the prior-year period. The increase was driven by higher capital expenditures, primarily within our ESM segment, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $328 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $325 million in the prior-year period. The increase was driven by an increase in net transfers to Honeywell offset by a decrease in finance lease payments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThere were no material changes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 to the items disclosed as critical accounting estimates in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Information Statement.\n\nITEM 2.
