  "item1_clean": "(1) 2023 total net sales includes the reduction in sales from the Powder Metal Matter.\nBacklog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts).\nTotal backlog was $218 billion and $196 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total RPO as of December 31, 2024, we expect approximately 25% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.\nAll of our businesses are subject to significant competition. Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, delivery schedule, past performance, reliability, customer service, innovation, and technology. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. Further, some non-U.S. competitors receive government research and development assistance, marketing subsidies, and other assistance for their products beyond the assistance that may be available to us as a U.S. company.\nOur aerospace businesses compete with numerous U.S. and foreign businesses that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture products and spare parts. Customer selections of aircraft engines, components, and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services. In addition, customers (including the U.S. government and other governments) may purchase parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer, which affects spare parts sales. Some competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products.\nOur defense businesses compete with numerous U.S. and foreign companies in most defense and government electronics, space, effectors, communications, command and control, technical services and support, and other segments. We frequently partner on defense programs with our major suppliers, some of whom are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. In addition, the competitive landscape in the defense industry continues to evolve with trends such as the continued increase in commercial competitors, new entrants with different technology approaches and business models, governmental bid evaluation processes requesting expanded intellectual property disclosures and rights sharing that may risk the loss of competitively sensitive information, and increased government, particularly foreign government, sponsorship of competitors on defense development programs. Moreover, our potential international contract awards, particularly for sales of defense products and services, may be limited by our ability to agree to offset obligations or industrial cooperation obligations, sometimes in the form of in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, designed to enhance local industry.\nAs a global technology and innovation-driven company, we depend on a highly skilled workforce. Attracting, developing, advancing, and retaining the best talent is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our business. Individuals with technical, engineering, and science backgrounds, experience, or interests are particularly important for us to succeed in the industries in which we compete. In addition, our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearances due to our classified programs. Macroeconomic, industry, and labor market conditions continue to affect the environment for hiring and retaining employees with relevant qualifications and experience. While competition for talent has softened, we continue to experience challenges hiring highly qualified personnel for some of our most critical roles and in specific locations. We continuously monitor labor market conditions and trends to mitigate hiring and retention issues.\nThe Human Capital & Compensation Committee of the RTX Board of Directors oversees the Company’s human capital management.\nWorkforce Demographics.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our global employee population consisted of a total of approximately 186,000 employees, including approximately 57,000 engineering professionals and approximately 34,000 employees represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies. Our employees were located in 52 countries, with 68% of our employees located in the U.S. We have published our U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity EEO-1 report data as part of our Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) Report.\nWe strive to build high-performing teams. We believe a work environment where all individuals are seen, respected, valued, and protected enables them to focus on developing the most innovative solutions to our industry’s greatest challenges. Approximately 19% of our workforce across 31 of the countries in which we operate are members of one or more of our nine global employee resource groups (ERGs). We also support science, technology, engineering, and mathematics initiatives to inspire the workforce of the next generation and build talent pipelines.\nTalent Acquisition, Development, and Retention; Employee Health and Safety.\nWe continuously monitor the hiring, retention, and management of our employees by business and function with a focus to attract, develop, engage, advance, and\nretain the best talent in the industry. We aim to identify and hire quality external talent with skills matched to our Company’s business needs. We invest in our workforce through internal and external education, training and development programs, and tuition assistance benefits. We also provide market competitive compensation and benefits. We recognize and reward performance during our annual review process. We regularly conduct talent reviews and develop succession plans to ensure that we continue to cultivate the leadership pipeline of talent needed to execute our business strategy. We solicit employee feedback on RTX’s performance as an employer via confidential surveys in the pre-hire, active, and exit stages of employment, and use those results to improve our workplace and employee experience. These surveys cover various topics related to employee engagement and culture.\nWe have industry-leading health and safety programs to help maintain a safe work environment for all employees and mitigate workplace incidents, risks, and hazards. We review and monitor our performance and encourage employee input to identify opportunities to reduce incidents. Moreover, we have industry-leading ethics and compliance programs to help mitigate associated employee risks. We also provide health and wellness benefits and support flexible work arrangements for our employees.\nResearch and Development and Operations\nOur innovative products and services incorporate advanced technologies. As a result, we invest substantial amounts in research and development activities using our own funds and under contractual arrangements with our customers, to enhance existing products and services and develop future technologies to meet our customers’ changing needs and requirements, as well as to address new business opportunities.\nWe manufacture and service our products in approximately 230 manufacturing, production, or overhaul facilities in approximately 30 countries, including the U.S.\nIntellectual Property\nWe maintain a robust portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, and franchises related to our businesses. We rely on a combination of these rights, along with nondisclosure agreements, information technology (IT) security systems, internal controls and compliance systems, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses to certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in the performance of government contracts. Commercial customers also have licenses to certain of our intellectual property largely in connection with the sale of our products. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.\nSuppliers and Raw Materials\nWe are dependent on a global supply chain for a wide range of raw materials, commodities, components, and services. Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. In addition, in some cases, we must comply with specific procurement requirements, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. We are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium, nickel, and titanium, and we rely on foreign suppliers as single-source suppliers of some components.\nIn recent years, we have experienced supply chain disruptions that have impacted our ability to procure raw materials, microelectronics, and certain commodities, resulting in delays and increased costs. These disruptions have been driven by supply chain market constraints and macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and labor market shortages. The high inflationary environment has increased material and component prices, labor rates and supplier costs, which has negatively impacted our costs. Current geopolitical conditions, including conflicts and other causes of strained intercountry relations, as well as sanctions and other trade restrictive activities, are continuing to contribute to these supply chain issues.\nWe have implemented certain actions and programs which have mitigated some of the impacts, but we anticipate that supply chain disruptions will continue. We work with our suppliers and subcontractors to assess and address the causes of performance failures and delays, including by providing suppliers with raw materials and technical support. We have arranged second and third supply source alternatives in some cases and have increased our materials and parts inventory. We regularly pursue cost\nOther Matters Relating to Our Business\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the DoD and the FAA. Similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business.\nU.S. Government Contracts.\nAs previously discussed, the U.S. government is our largest customer, representing a substantial majority of our total defense sales. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs, and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source, and any other damages it suffers. Our U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures, and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government; department-specific regulations that implement or suppleme",
  "item7_clean": "Global Supply Chain.\nWe are dependent on a global supply chain and have experienced supply chain disruptions that resulted in delays and increased costs and adversely affected our performance. These disruptions impacted our ability to procure raw materials, microelectronics, and certain commodities on a timely basis and/or at expected prices, and are driven by supply chain market constraints and macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and labor market shortages. Current geopolitical conditions, including conflicts and other causes of strained intercountry relations, as well as sanctions and other trade restrictive activities, are contributing to these issues. Furthermore, our suppliers and subcontractors have been impacted by these same issues. We have implemented actions and programs to mitigate some of the impacts but anticipate supply chain disruptions to continue.\nEconomic Environment.\nThe inflationary environment has increased material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs and has negatively impacted our performance, including our productivity expectations. Due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and their respective customer and supplier contracts, we are not always able to offset cost increases by increasing our contract value or pricing, in particular on our fixed-price contracts. Increasing material, component, and labor prices could subject us to losses in our fixed price contracts in the event of cost overruns. In addition, higher interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and tightened the availability of capital. Among other things, these effects can constrain our customers’ purchasing power and decrease orders for our products and services and impact the ability of our customers to make payments and our suppliers to perform. Moreover, volatility in interest rates and financial markets can lead to economic uncertainty, an economic downturn or recession, and impact the demand for our products and services as well as our supply chain. We continue to pursue strategic and operational initiatives to help address these macroeconomic pressures, including our digital transformation, operational modernization, cost reduction, and advanced\ntechnology programs, and we apply our Customer Oriented Results and Excellence (CORE) operating platform to the execution of these initiatives. However, the impact of these pressures and corresponding initiatives is uncertain and subject to a range of factors and future developments.\nU.S. Government’s Budget.\nSince the end of its fiscal year 2024, the U.S. government has been operating under two continuing resolutions, the most recent of which was signed on December 21, 2024, to keep the government funded through March 14, 2025 while Congress works to enact full year fiscal year 2025 (FY25) appropriation bills. Under a continuing resolution, federal agencies continue to operate generally at the same funding levels as the prior year, but typically new spending initiatives cannot be executed during this period. It is currently uncertain whether Congress will be able to enact FY25 appropriations bills and, if such bills are passed, the spending levels and priorities for defense and other areas. If Congress is unable to complete the FY25 appropriation bills (or pass another continuing resolution) by March 14, 2025, then the U.S. government would shut down, during which time federal agencies would cease all non-essential functions. In the event of a U.S. government shutdown, our business, program performance and results of operations could be impacted by the resulting disruptions to federal government offices, workers, and operations, including risks relating to the funding of certain programs, stop work orders, delays in contract awards, new program starts, payments for work performed, and other actions. We also may experience similar impacts in the event of an extended period of continuing resolutions. Generally, the significance of these impacts will primarily be based on the length of the shutdown or continuing resolution. Furthermore, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which imposes limits on discretionary spending for defense and non-defense programs in exchange for the lifting of the debt ceiling in June 2023, if Congress fails to enact appropriation bills by April 30, 2025, budget caps will be reduced and corresponding automatic reductions to agency budget accounts will be enforced through sequestration.\nGeopolitical Matters.\nIn response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company’s management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software, and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers; however, based on information available to date, we do not currently expect these issues will have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We will continue to monitor future developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers.\nIn February 2023, China announced sanctions against Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD) (a former RTX business segment which became part of the Raytheon business during the third quarter of 2023), and previously announced it may take measures against RTX, in connection with certain foreign military sales to Taiwan. The Chinese sanctions against RMD included a fine equal to twice the value of the arms that RMD sold to Taiwan since September 2020. Since that time, China has announced additional sanctions against the Raytheon business and a Collins joint venture. If China were to impose additional sanctions, enforce announced sanctions, or take other regulatory action against RTX, our suppliers, affiliates, or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. Any impact of these or other potential sanctions or other actions by China, is uncertain.\nWe have direct commercial sales contracts for products and services to certain foreign customers, for which U.S. government review and approval have been pending. The U.S. government’s approval of these sales is subject to a range of factors, including its foreign policies related to these customers, which are subject to continuing review and potential changes. Likewise, regulatory approvals previously granted for prior sales can be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer. In addition, certain programs require approvals by foreign governments, and those approvals may not be obtained on a timely basis or at all or may be revoked. If we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals, or those approvals are revoked, it could have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe continue to closely monitor potential impacts to RTX’s business, customers, suppliers, employees, and operations in Israel, the Middle East, and the region at large due to the war in Gaza, including a recently-announced ceasefire, the related escalation of conflict and instability in the region, and the regime change in Syria. RTX’s commercial manufacturing facilities in Israel remain open and operational and have continued exporting products and importing critical items and raw materials. RTX’s defense programs’ ability to receive components from Israel has not been impacted in any material respect, although we could experience future delivery delays of certain products if the ceasefire does not hold, or if further escalations arise. The overall impacts to RTX from this situation have been minimal; however, given the volatile nature of the situation, the potential impacts to RTX are subject to change.\nOn February 1, 2025, President Trump issued three executive orders directing the United States to impose new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, to take effect on February 4, 2025, and on February 3, 2025, President Trump announced his intention to pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico for the next month. The tariffs impose an additional 25%\nrate of duty on all imports from Canada and Mexico (other than imports of Canadian energy resources exports, which are subject to a 10%\nrate of duty) and an additional 10%\nrate of duty on all imports from China. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the imposition of the announced tariffs to our business and financial condition. RTX also exports products to Canada, Mexico and China and we are currently monitoring the potential impact, if any, of actions taken in response to these tariffs by Canada, Mexico and China. On January 28, 2025, RTX announced its full-year 2025 financial outlook, and that outlook does not reflect the impact of tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China announced pursuant to the February 1, 2025 executive orders. While we do not believe that the tariffs announced by the United States on February 1, 2025 will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, there may be an impact to our previously issued outlook. The actual impact of the new tariffs is subject to a number of factors including the effective date and duration of such tariffs, changes in the amount, scope and nature of the tariffs in the future, any countermeasures that the target countries may take and any mitigating actions that may become available.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nWe use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by business segment, and to monitor and assess our results of operations:\nNet sales: a metric that measures our revenue for the current year;\nOperating profit: a measure of our profit for the year, before non-operating expenses (income), net and income tax expense;\nOperating profit margin: a measure of our Operating profit as a percentage of Total net sales; and\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations: a measure of the amount of cash generated by our business operations.\n(dollars in millions)\n\nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\n(1) See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\nA reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n2024 Compared with 2023\nThe organic net sales increase of $1.7 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher net sales of $1.4 billion from land and air defense systems programs driven by higher net sales on certain international Patriot programs, certain international National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) programs, and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) programs. Also contributing to the increase was higher net sales of $0.4 billion from advanced technology programs primarily driven by higher volume on classified programs and on a development program. Additionally, the organic net sales increase includes $0.3 billion of sales associated with the restart of certain contracts with a Middle East customer.\nThese increases were partially offset by lower net sales of $0.5 billion from air and space defense systems programs primarily due to the completion of certain programs, and the timing of a prior year program award.\nThe decrease in Other net sales in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by $0.1 billion related to the Raytheon Contract Termination initiated in the second quarter of 2024.\nThe organic operating profit increase of $0.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher volume of $0.2 billion primarily driven by the net sales increases noted above and an improvement in net EAC adjustments of $0.2 billion. The change in net EAC adjustments was primarily due to improvement in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts. Included in the change in net EAC adjustments was a benefit from the absence of a $51 million unfavorable adjustment in 2023 related to significant contract options exercised, which was offset by a $53 million unfavorable EAC adjustment in the third quarter of 2024 related to cost increases on a classified program.\nThe decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily relates to the sale of the CIS business completed in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe decrease in Other operating profit in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by $0.6 billion related to the Raytheon Contract Termination initiated in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $0.4 billion gain on the sale of the CIS business in the first quarter of 2024, and a $0.1 billion net benefit primarily related to reserve and contract loss provision adjustments recognized in the fourth quarter of 2024 as a result of restarting work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer.\n2023 Compared with 2022\nThe organic net sales increase of $1.3 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher net sales of $0.5 billion from advanced technology programs, $0.3 billion from air and space defense systems programs, $0.2 billion from cybersecurity, intelligence and services programs, and $0.2 billion from naval power programs. The increase in advanced technology programs includes higher net sales on an advanced development program awarded in the third quarter of 2022, and higher net sales on certain classified programs awarded in 2022. The increase in air and space defense systems programs includes higher net sales on the StormBreaker program, driven by awards in the first and fourth quarters of 2023 and higher net sales on the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) program, driven by an award in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in cybersecurity, intelligence and services programs was driven by certain classified programs as well as federal and civil programs. The increase in naval power programs was due to higher volumes on Naval Strike Missile and AIM-9X programs.\nThe organic operating profit decrease of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an unfavorable change in mix and other performance of $0.1 billion, and an unfavorable net change in EAC adjustments of $0.1 billion, partially offset by higher volume of $0.2 billion. The unfavorable change in mix and other performance was primarily driven by an expected decline in certain higher margin international programs and higher volume on various lower margin programs including early production phase programs. The net change in EAC adjustments was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts and approximately $50 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments related to significant contract options exercised in 2023. The increase in volume was principally driven by the higher net sales discussed above.\nThe increase in Other operating profit in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by the absence of a $42 million charge in 2022 associated with a divestiture of a small non-core naval power business, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.\nThe decrease in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily r",
