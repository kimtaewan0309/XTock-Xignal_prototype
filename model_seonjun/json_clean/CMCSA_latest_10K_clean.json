We also license our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers and distribute certain of our Sky-branded entertainment television networks to third-party video service providers.\nBusiness Services Connectivity Segment\nOur Business Services Connectivity segment consists of our domestic service offerings for small businesses, which include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services, as well as our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises. Certain business customers subscribe to our video services, and the associated revenue is included in our Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\nOur domestic broadband offerings have a range of service levels, including fiber-based services that deliver symmetrical speeds ranging up to 100 gigabits per second.\nOur small business broadband, wireline voice and wireless service offerings are similar to those provided to our residential customers and also include cloud-based cybersecurity services, wireless backup connectivity, advanced Wi-Fi solutions, video monitoring services and other cl\nOur enterprise solutions offerings also include ethernet network services, which connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options, advanced voice services, and a software-defined networking product. Larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services. These services are primarily provided to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with multiple locations both within and outside of our distribution footprint, where we provide coverage outside of our service areas through agreements with other companies to use their networks.\nNetwork and Technology\nThe segments within our Connectivity & Platforms business use our HFC network in the United States, which we believe is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements and enables us to continue to grow capacity and capabilities over time.\nThis network provides the two-way transmissions required to provide connectivity services and interactive video and entertainment services through our platforms, and consists primarily of headends, fiber-optic and coaxial cables owned or leased by us, and equipment such as lasers, routers, switches and content distribution servers. Across nearly our entire domestic footprint, we leverage DOCSIS 3.1 to offer up to gigabit-plus downstream broadband speeds to residential and business customers. We also deploy fiber-to-the-premises with symmetrical speed offerings ranging up to 10 gigabits per second to residential customers who request that service, subject to local construction constraints, and up to 100 gigabits per second to business customers. We offer domestic wireless services using an MVNO agreement that allows us to offer services using Verizon’s wireless network along with our existing network of Wi-Fi hotspots across our network.\nWe continue to evolve and enhance our domestic network capabilities. In connection with a multiyear network transformation plan, in 2022 we began rolling out downstream speeds of up to 2 gigabits per second to our residential customers, which are now available to approximately 50% of our HFC network footprint. In 2023, we began deploying in select markets DOCSIS 4.0, which enables us to deliver multigigabit symmetrical broadband speeds over our existing HFC network. Additionally, as part of our network evolution, our engineering teams have been virtualizing and automating many core network functions using various technologies to expand capacity, increase operating efficiency, and identify and fix network issues proactively before they affect our customers. Our investment in virtualizing the network helps maintain network reliability and operational efficiency regardless of whether we connect a residence using either fiber or our HFC network. We continue to extend our network’s reach to new homes and businesses within our existing service areas, as well as edging-out to new service areas to expand the number of homes and businesses passed, and a significant portion of new homes and businesses passed are connected with fiber. We also partner with local, state and federal agencies when possible to provide services to unserved and underserved communities leveraging governmental subsidies where available.\nThe components of our domestic network require periodic maintenance and replacement and are primarily located on owned and leased properties, and in locations under agreements with local public utilities and municipalities. We operate national and regional data centers with equipment that is used to provide our services, and we maintain network operations centers with equipment necessary to monitor and manage the status of our services and network.\nOur international services are offered leveraging third-party networks, as well as our own core fiber network for broadband and wireline voice services in the United Kingdom. The related operating plant and equipment used to provide our video and connectivity services include leased satellite system signal receiving, encoding and decoding devices, and owned and leased headends and distribution networks, including coaxial, fiber-optic cables and other related equipment. For a majority of international customers, our video platform is delivered via one-way digital satellite transmission that uses satellites leased from third parties for the distribution of television networks, augmented by a set-top box and two-way broadband connectivity. We offer broadband and wireline voice services in the United Kingdom and Italy using third-party networks. In many cases, the fee for us to access these networks is on regulated terms. The ranges of service levels and speeds we offer are dependent upon the capabilities and reach of these third-party networks. We offer wireless services in the United Kingdom using a combination of a third-party’s network and our own mobile core network.\nOur Connectivity & Platforms business engineering teams continue to focus on technology initiatives to develop and deploy next-generation media, content delivery, content aggregation and streaming platforms that support X1, Sky Q, NOW, Sky Stream, Sky Glass, Xumo and our cloud DVR technology. These platforms are based on our global technology platform and integrate linear television networks, owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other internet-based apps, and on demand programming into a unified experience with voice-activated remote control search and interactive features. We also continue to focus on leveraging our own cloud network services to deliver video and advanced search capabilities. Our Connectivity & Platforms business also pursues technology initiatives related to broadband and wireless services that leverage our global technology platform. We provide our customers with in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi, the ability to manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home with our mobile apps and online portal, advanced security technology, and other features.\nTo offer video services, Residential Connectivity & Platforms licenses substantial amounts of linear television programming from third parties and from our Media segment. The fees associated with these distribution agreements are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the television network programming and a per subscriber fee, although programming expenses for certain television networks are based on a fixed fee. Additionally, certain of our agreements include the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our on demand services, online portal, mobile apps, the Xumo Stream Box, and our NOW and NOW TV streaming services.\nThe programming on our Sky-branded entertainment television networks includes content licensed from third parties and from our Studios segment, including certain original content. Our most significant agreements for the licensing of film and television entertainment content include exclusive rights with Paramount, Warner Bros. and our Studios segment.\nOther Sources of Supply and Operations\nWe purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant amount of customer premise equipment, including wireless gateways and set-top boxes, network equipment, and services to provide our broadband and video services to residential and business customers. We also purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless devices. We use a limited number of vendors to provide customer billing for our residential and business customers.\nOur technical services groups perform various tasks, including installations, plant maintenance and upgrades to our domestic network, and servicing and upgrades of customer premise equipment. The service vehicles used by our technical services groups are primarily owned. Our customer service teams provide primarily 24/7 call-answering capability and other services, and also offer our services to residential and business customers.\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms\nWe compete with a number of companies, many with significant financial resources, that offer internet services, including:\nwireline telecommunications companies\nwireless telecommunications companies\nmunicipal broadband networks and power companies\nsatellite broadband providers\nCertain wireline telecommunications companies, such as AT&T, Frontier, Lumen and Verizon in the United States and BT and Virgin Media O2 in the United Kingdom, have built and are continuing to build fiber-based wireline network infrastructure further into their networks, which enables them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional copper digital subscriber line (“DSL”) technology, and are offering services with these higher speeds in many of our service areas. Certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our broadband services.\nVarious wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of technologies, including 5G fixed wireless networks and 4G and 5G wireless broadband services. These networks work with devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and mobile and fixed wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards.\nOther companies and municipalities have launched fiber-based or newer satellite-based broadband technologies that provide services in certain areas in which we operate.\nDomestic broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state levels may result in other service providers deploying subsidized internet access within our footprint. The availability of these and other offerings could negatively impact the demand for our domestic broadband services.\nWe compete with national and regional wireless service providers in the United States, including AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, and wireless service providers in the United Kingdom that offer wireless service on both a stand-alone basis and with other services as bundled offerings.\nWe compete with a number of companies offering video services in the Connectivity & Platforms markets, including:\nDTC streaming service providers and aggregators, including:\nsubscription-based services, such as Disney+ and Netflix, that offer online services that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming\nvirtual multichannel video providers, such as Hulu + Live TV and YouTube TV, that offer streamed linear television networks\nfree ad-supported televisi",

We expect to receive additional proceeds for the sale of our interest in Hulu following the final determination of Hulu’s fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process, at which time we will recognize the sale of our interest. See Note 7.\nIn November 2024, we announced our intention to create SpinCo, a new independent publicly traded company through a tax-free spin-off. We are targeting to complete the Spin-off by the end of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. There can be no assurance that a separation transaction will occur, or, if one does occur, of its terms or timing.\nConsolidated Operating Results\nYear ended December 31 (in millions, except per share data)\n\nOur Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. The changes reflect the year-over-year basis point changes in the rounded Adjusted EBITDA margins.\nConstant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 44 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts.\nWe continue to focus on growing our higher-margin connectivity businesses while managing overall operating costs. We also continue to invest in our network to support higher-speed broadband offerings and to expand the number of homes and businesses passed. A competitive environment, which has increased in recent years, has had negative impacts on our customer relationships additions/(losses). In addition, government funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which provided a monthly discount towards broadband service for eligible low-income households, expired during the second quarter of 2024, which had a negative impact on our residential domestic broadband customer relationships. We believe our residential connectivity revenue will increase as a result of growth in average domestic broadband revenue per customer, as well as increases in domestic wireless and international connectivity revenue. At the same time, we expect continued declines in video revenue as a result of domestic customer net losses due to shifting video consumption patterns and the competitive environment, although customer net losses typically mitigate the impact of continued rate increases on programming expenses. We also expect continued declines in other revenue related to declines in wireline voice revenue.\nWe believe our Business Services Connectivity segment will continue to grow by offering competitive services, including enterprise solutions.\nConnectivity & Platforms Customer Metri\nNet Additions / (Losses)\nCustomer Relationships\nDomestic Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships\n\nprimarily consists of revenue from the sale of advertising across our platforms in the Connectivity & Platforms markets, including advertising as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks in the United States, and advertising on Sky-branded entertainment television networks and on our digital properties.

We had 36 million and 31 million paid subscribers of Peacock as of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Peacock paid subscribers represent customers from which we recognize distribution revenue, including both customers that pay us directly and customers receiving the service through arrangements with companies who sell Peacock on our behalf. In these arrangements, paid subscribers are counted based on the terms of the arrangement when the related revenue is recognized. As a result, certain customers are counted when they activate their account, while other customers are counted when the Peacock service is made available to them as part of their bundled service offering regardless of whether it is activated.\nMedia Segment – Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and production costs\nprimarily consists of the amortization of owned and licensed content, including sports rights, direct production costs, p\nroduction overhead, on-air talent costs and costs associated with the distribution of our television networks to multichannel video providers.\nProgramming and production costs increased in 2024 primarily due to costs associated with the Paris Olympics, an increase in other sports programming costs for our domestic television networks, the impact of foreign currency, an increase in entertainment content costs for our television networks, including the impact of the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages in the prior year, and higher programming costs at Peacock.\nMarketing and promotion expenses\nprimarily consists of the costs associated with promoting our television networks, Peacock and other digital properties.\nMarketing and promotion expenses increased in 2024 primarily due to increased costs associated with the Paris Olympics, partially offset by lower costs related to marketing for entertainment programming.\nprimarily consists of salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses.\nOther expenses increased in 2024 primarily due to an increase in costs related to Peacock and higher severance charges in 2024.\nMedia segment total costs and expenses included $6.7 billion and $6.1 billion related to Peacock in 2024 and 2023, respectively, including amounts related to the Paris Olympics in 2024.\nStudios Segment Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n\nPercentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.
