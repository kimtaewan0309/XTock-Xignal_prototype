MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains some predictive statements about future events, including statements related to conditions in domestic or global economies, conditions in steel, aluminum, and recycled metals market places, Steel Dynamics' revenues, costs of purchased materials, future profitability and earnings, and the operation of new, existing or planned facilities. These statements, which we generally precede or accompany by such typical conditional words as \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"believe\", \"estimate\", \"plan\", \"seek\", \"project\", or \"expect\", or by the words \"may\", \"will\", or \"should\", are intended to be made as \"forward-looking\", subject to many risks and uncertainties, within the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements speak only as of this date and are based upon information and assumptions, which we consider reasonable as of this date, concerning our businesses and the environments in which they operate. Such predictive statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we undertake no duty to update or revise any such statements. Some factors that could cause such forward-looking statements to turn out differently than anticipated include: (1) domestic and global economic factors; (2) global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel, together with increased scrap prices; (3) pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues; (4) the cyclical nature of the steel industry and the industries we serve; (5) volatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal, scrap substitutes and supplies, and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers; (6) cost and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil, and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions; (7) increased environmental, greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability considerations from our customers and investors or related regulations; (8) compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements; (9) significant price and other forms of competition from other steel and aluminum producers, scrap processors and alternative materials; (10) availability of an adequate source of supply of scrap for our metals recycling operations; (11) cybersecurity threats and risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology; (12) the implementation of our growth strategy; (13) our ability to retain, develop and attract key personnel; (14) litigation and legal compliance; (15) unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns; (16) governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits; (17) our senior unsecured credit facility contains, and any future financing agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility; and (18) the impacts of impairment charges.\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n, and on our website,\nwww.steeldynamics.com\nunder “Investors – SEC Filings.”\nDescription of the Business\nWe are one of the largest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers in the United States, based on estimated steelmaking and steel coating capacity of approximately 16 million tons and actual metals recycling volumes, with one of the most diversified product and end market portfolios in the domestic steel industry, combined with meaningful downstream steel fabrication operations. We are currently continuing with commissioning and startup of our aluminum operations to further diversify our end markets with plans to supply aluminum flat rolled products with high recycled content to the countercyclical sustainable beverage can industry, in addition to the automotive and industrial sectors. Our primary sources of revenue are currently from the manufacture and sale of steel products, the processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals, and the fabrication and sale of steel joists and deck products.\n\nSteel Operations Segment Results 2025 vs. 2024\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, our steel operations achieved record shipments of 3.6 million tons (3.3 million excluding intra-segment) as imports declined from the elevated levels seen earlier in the year. We continue to observe some hesitancy from customers due to trade uncertainties, despite several encouraging demand drivers—such as manufacturing onshoring, infrastructure program funding, lower interest rates, and the increasing regionalization of supply chains in the US. Third quarter 2025 total steel segment average selling prices increased 6%, or $61 per ton, compared to the third quarter of 2024, while segment shipments increased 14%. Net sales for the steel operations in the third quarter of 2025 increased 21% compared to the same period in 2024, due to the increased segment shipments, coupled with increased average selling prices. Net sales for the steel operations increased 4% in the first nine months of 2025 when compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to increased segment shipments offsetting decreased average selling prices, particularly in the first quarter of 2025.\nMetallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost, generally comprising approximately 55% to 65% of our steel mill operations’ manufacturing costs. Our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel mills increased $14 per ton, or 4%, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, consistent with overall increased domestic ferrous scrap pricing noted below in the Metals Recycling Operations segment discussion. In the first nine months of 2025, our metallic raw material cost per ton was flat compared to the same period in 2024.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, as a result of average selling prices rising more than scrap costs, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average steel mill selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed in our steel mills) increased 7% compared to the third quarter of 2024. As a result of this metal spread expansion, operating income for the steel operations increased 65%, to $496.8 million, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. First nine months 2025 operating income decreased 22%, to $1.1 billion, compared to the first nine months of 2024 due primarily to a 7% decrease in metal spread, as average selling prices decreased more than scrap costs despite higher shipment volume.\n\nMetals Recycling Operations Segment\nMetals recycling operations include our OmniSource ferrous and nonferrous processing, transportation, marketing, brokerage, and scrap management services throughout the United States and in Central and Northern Mexico. Our steel mills utilize a large portion of the ferrous scrap sold by our metals recycling operations as raw material in our steelmaking operations, and the remainder is sold to other consumers, such as other steel manufacturers and foundries. In the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, 66% and 63%, respectively, of metals recycling operations ferrous scrap was sold to our own steel mills, while our steel mill utilization was 88% and 80% in the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Metals recycling operations accounted for 11% and 12% of our consolidated net sales during the three-month periods ending September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively, and 12% and 11% during the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively.\nMetals Recycling Operations Segment Shipments:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nFerrous metal (gross tons)\nNonferrous metals (thousands of pounds)\nMetals Recycling Operations Segment Results 2025 vs. 2024\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, our metals recycling operations benefitted from increased domestic steel mill utilization, resulting in near record quarterly ferrous shipments. Ferrous scrap shipments increased 9% compared to the same period in 2024 while nonferrous shipments increased 1%. Ferrous scrap average selling prices increased 6% during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, while nonferrous scrap prices increased 3%, resulting in an overall 10% increase in segment net sales. Ferrous metal spreads (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap) increased 3% during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, and nonferrous metal spreads increased 74%, particularly due to copper. As a result of the increased metals spreads, particularly within nonferrous, metals recycling operations operating income increased 414% to $31.5 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024.\nNet sales for our metals recycling operations in the first nine months of 2025 increased 6% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by increased ferrous volumes and increased selling prices for both ferrous and nonferrous metals. Ferrous scrap average selling prices increased 2% during the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, while nonferrous average selling prices increased 7%. Ferrous shipments increased 5% and nonferrous shipments decreased 2% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the first nine months of 2024. Ferrous metal spreads were flat, while nonferrous metal spreads increased 32% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the first nine months of 2024. As a result of the combination of these volume and metal spread changes, metals recycling operations operating income in the first nine months of 2025 of $78.5 million increased 88% from the first nine months of 2024.\n\nOperating Statement Classifications\n.
