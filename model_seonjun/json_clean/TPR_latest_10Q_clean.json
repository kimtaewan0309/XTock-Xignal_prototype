Accordingly, aggregate borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Amended Revolving Credit Facility will not exceed $2.00 billion.\nThe carrying amounts of the China Credit Facility include the impact of changes in the exchange rate of the United States Dollar against the Renminbi.\nWe believe that our Amended Revolving Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. As of September 27, 2025, there were 18 financial institutions participating in the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, with no one participant maintaining a combined maximum commitment percentage in excess of 10%. We have no reason to believe at this time that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the facility in the event we elect to draw funds in the foreseeable future.\nWe have the ability to draw on our credit facilities or access other sources of financing options available to us in the credit and capital markets for, among other things, acquisition or integration-related costs, our restructuring initiatives, settlement of a material contingency, or a material adverse business or macroeconomic development, as well as for other general corporate business purposes.\nManagement believes that cash flows from operations, access to the credit and capital markets and our credit lines, on-hand cash and cash equivalents and our investments will provide adequate funds to support our operating, capital and debt service requirements for fiscal 2026 and beyond. There can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to fund working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments, as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements, depends on future operating performance and cash flow. This future operating performance and cash flow are subject to prevailing economic conditions, and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control.\nCommercial Paper Program\nOn July 24, 2025, the Company entered into a commercial paper borrowing program (the \"Commercial Paper Program\") that provides for the issuance of up to $2.00 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities up to 365 days. Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Amended Revolving Credit Facility and may be used to support the Company's general corporate needs. The aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and Amended Revolving Credit Facility will not exceed $2.00 billion. During the three months ended September 27, 2025, the Company issued notes under the Commercial Paper Program with original maturities less than 3 months. As of September 27, 2025, the Company had $240.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program with a weighted average interest rate of 4.260%. Refer to Note 11, \"Debt\" for further information.\nStuart Weitzman Business Divestiture\nOn February 16, 2025, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement to sell the Stuart Weitzman Business for total cash consideration of $105.0 million, subject to customary adjustments. The sale was completed on August 4, 2025. Refer to Note 5, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures\" for further information.\nSupply Chain Finance\nTo improve our working capital efficiency, we make available to certain suppliers, a voluntary supply chain finance (“SCF”) program that enables our suppliers to sell their receivables from the Company to a global financial institution on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating. We do not have the ability to refinance or modify payment terms to the global financial institution through the SCF program. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. Refer to Note 2, \"Basis of Presentation and Organization,\" for additional information.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2026 capital expenditures and cloud computing implementation costs were $38.0 million. The Company expects total fiscal 2026 capital expenditures and cloud computing costs to be approximately $200.0 million. Certain cloud computing implementation costs are recognized within Prepaid expenses and Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nStock Repurchase Plan\n2026 Share Repurchase Program\nOn September 10, 2025, the Company announced that the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to $3.00 billion of its outstanding common stock (the \"2026 Share Repurchase Program\"), replacing the 2022 Share Repurchase Program which had $561.7 million of remaining authorization.\nDuring the three months ended September 27, 2025, the Company repurchased $500.0 million of common stock, $238.3 million under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program and $261.7 million under the 2026 Share Repurchase Program. As of September 27, 2025, the Company had $2.74 billion of remaining repurchase authorization under the 2026 Share Repurchase Program.\n2025 Share Repurchase Program\nOn November 13, 2024, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to $2.00 billion of outstanding shares of its common stock (the \"2025 Share Repurchase Program\"). On November 21, 2024, the Company entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (the “ASR Agreements”) with Bank of America, N.A. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (the “Dealers”) to repurchase an aggregate of up to $2.00 billion of the Company’s shares of common stock. Under the ASR Agreements, the Company paid $2.00 billion to the Dealers and received an initial delivery of 28,363,766 shares of the Company's common stock on November 26, 2024. Final settlement was based on the volume-weighted average price (\"VWAP\") of the Company's common stock, less a discount, and occurred in four tranches. During the year ended June 28, 2025 and the quarter ended September 27, 2025, as a result of the increase in the VWAP of the Company's common stock, the Company cash-settled $6.6 million related to 92,536 shares of common stock and $195.7 million related to 1,838,270 shares of common stock, respectively, which completed the agreement. The average share price for the 28,363,766 shares received under the ASR Agreements was $77.64.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as well as brand intangibles at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In all fiscal years, the fair values of our Coach brand reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company recorded $244.1 million of impairment charges related to goodwill for the Kate Spade reporting unit and $610.7 million of impairment charges related to the Kate Spade indefinite-lived brand intangible. Several factors could impact the Kate Spade brand's ability to achieve expected future cash flows, including the optimization of the store fleet productivity, the success of international expansion strategies, the impact of promotional activity, continued economic volatility and potential operational challenges related to the macroeconomic factors, the reception of new collections in all business channels and other initiatives aimed at increasing profitability of the business. If profitability trends decline during fiscal 2026 from those that are expected, it is possible that an interim test, or our annual impairment test, could result in an impairment of these assets.\n\nITEM 2.
