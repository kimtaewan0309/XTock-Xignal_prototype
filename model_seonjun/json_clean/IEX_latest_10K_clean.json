The businesses located outside the U.S. are primarily based in Germany, India, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, Canada and China. The Company’s geographic diversity allows it to draw on the skills of a global workforce, provides greater stability to its operations, allows the Company to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers the Company an opportunity to access new markets for products.\nThe following table illustrates sales to customers within and outside the U.S. as a percentage of total sales for total IDEX as well as by segment and by reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nFMT\nHST\nScientific Fluidics & Optics\nPerformance Pneumatic Technologies\nMaterial Processing Technologies\nFSDP\nBAND-IT\nIDEX\nThe Company has production facilities in Suzhou, China, Vadodara, India and Ahmedabad, India that support multiple business units.

The Company believes it has an adequate supply of raw materials necessary to meet demand. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity pricing and inflation and attempts to control these impacts through increased prices to customers and various other programs with its suppliers.\nThe Company manufactures many of the parts and components used in its products. Substantially all materials, parts and components purchased by the Company are available from a large number of independent sources around the world. The Company believes it has a sufficient number of suppliers necessary to meet demand but continues to actively evaluate its current suppliers and identify alternative sources to manage supply chain constraints, if needed.\nInventory and Backlog\nThe Company is primarily a short cycle business and backlog is not generally considered a significant factor as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of the Company’s products. Even still, the Company regularly and systematically adjusts production schedules and quantities based on the flow of incoming orders. While backlog was elevated in recent years due to global supply chain constraints, which extended lead times, shifted customer order patterns and resulted in increased inventory to support production, customer destocking efforts beginning in 2023 have resulted in orders stabilizing with backlog and lead times returning to more normalized levels in 2024. The Company remains focused on delivering products and services to customers and continues to actively manage inventory levels. Further, the Company has not historically experienced significant order cancellations and does not expect significant order cancellations in the future.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to environmental, international trade, labor and employment, human rights, tax, anti-bribery and competition matters, did not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 9,000 employees.

Severance costs during both periods were incurred in conjunction with cost mitigation efforts as a result of market conditions.\nGain on Sale of Businesses - Net\nIn 2024, the Company completed the sale of Alfa Valvole, Srl (“Alfa Valvole”) for proceeds of $45.1 million, net of cash remitted, resulting in a gain on the sale of $4.0 million, net of a release of cumulative foreign currency translation losses of $5.5 million. In 2023, the Company completed the sale of Micropump, Inc. (“Micropump”) for proceeds of $110.3 million, net of cash remitted, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $93.8 million, and the sale of Novotema, SpA (“Novotema”) for proceeds of $8.3 million, net of cash remitted, which resulted in a loss of $9.1 million. For additional information, refer to\n, “Acquisitions and Divestitures,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther (Income) Expense – net\nOther (income) expense – net was $2.6 million of income in 2024 compared to $5.2 million of expense in 2023. The change was primarily due to the absence of a $7.7 million credit loss reserve on an investment with a collaborative partner (see\n, “Collaborative Investments,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail) in 2023 that did not reoccur in 2024.\nInterest Expense - Net\nInterest expense - net decreased primarily due to higher interest earned on cash balances in 2024, partially offset by incremental interest expense in 2024, including the impact of higher debt outstanding to finance the acquisition of Mott.\nThe 2024 effective tax rate was 21.1% as compared with the 2023 effective tax rate of 21.7%. One-time discrete tax benefits lowered the effective tax rate in 2024 and 2023. For additional information, refer to\n, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn October 2021, members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agreed to a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges associated with the digitalization of the economy. In December 2021, the OECD released the Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), which define the global minimum tax and call for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing draft legislation to implement the minimum tax directive. Many aspects of Pillar Two became effective January 1, 2025; however, nearly all of the jurisdictions in which IDEX operates have an effective tax rate above the 15% threshold. The Company does not expect a material impact from the Pillar Two income tax rules. We are continuing to monitor legislative developments and evaluate financial results for changes in the expected impact.\nResults of Reportable Business Segments\nThe Company has three reportable segments: FMT, HST and FSDP. For a detailed description of the operations within each segment, please refer to Part I,\nManagement’s measurements of segment performance are Net sales, adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nFluid & Metering Technologies Segment\nYear Ended December 31,\nComponents of Change\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n\nDivestitures included Alfa Valvole, sold in June 2024.\nOrganic net sales were positively impacted by price capture and targeted growth initiatives, which were offset by lower volumes, driven primarily by softness in agriculture and energy markets. Strength in municipal water markets was muted by softness in the semiconductor capital construction market within our water business.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin decreased primarily due to higher employee-related costs, higher discretionary spending and unfavorable mix, partially offset by strong price/cost and favorable operational productivity, net of lower volume leverage.\nHealth & Science Technologies Segment\nYear Ended December 31,\nComponents of Change\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\nAcquisitions included Iridian Spectral Technologies acquired in May 2023, STC Material Solutions acquired in December 2023 and Mott acquired in September 2024. Divestitures included Micropump sold in August 2023 and Novotema sold in December 2023\nOrganic net sales were negatively impacted by cyclical market softness in the life sciences and semiconductor markets. This decrease was partially offset by price capture across the segment and targeted growth initiatives within the aerospace/defense market.\nExcluding the net accretive impact of acquisitions and divestitures, Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased primarily due to higher employee-related costs and unfavorable mix, partially offset by price/cost, lower discretionary spending and favorable operational productivity, net of lower volume leverage.\nFire & Safety/Diversified Products Segment\nYear Ended December 31,\nComponents of Change\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\nOrganic net sales were positively impacted by strong targeted growth initiatives, continued recovery in fire original equipment manufacturer markets and price capture. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable mix due to the\ncyclical nature of project sales in our North American dispensing business and softer demand in automotive and industrial markets.\nThe decrease in Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to higher employee-related costs and unfavorable mix, partially offset by price/cost.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on management’s current expectations and currently available information, the Company believes current cash, cash from operations and cash available under the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to meet its operating\ncash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements, share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments to holders of the Company’s common stock for the foreseeable future\n. Additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, the Company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings. The Company believes that additional borrowings through various financing alternatives remain available, if required.\nMott was acquired during the third quarter of 2024 for cash consideration of $986.2 million, net of cash acquired of $3.1 million. The acquisition was funded using a combination of cash on hand of $211.9 million, borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Facility of $279.3 million, and the net proceeds of $495.0 million from the issuance of the 4.950% Senior Notes. For additional information regarding the borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Facility and the 4.950% Senior Notes, refer to\n, “Borrowings,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelect key liquidity metrics at December 31, 2024 are as follows:\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash held outside of the United States\nRevolving Facility capacity\nRevolving Facility availability\nOperating Working Capital\nOperating working capital, calculated as Receivables – net plus Inventories – net minus Trade accounts payable, is used by management as a measurement of operational results as well as the short-term liquidity of the Company. The following table details Operating working capital as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nLess: Trade accounts payable\nOperating working capital\nOperating working capital increased $28.9 million to $697.8 million at December 31, 2024. Acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation increased Operating working capital by $38.0 million during 2024. Apart from these items, receivables increased due to strong price capture, which more than offset the impact of lower volumes; inventories decreased with lower volumes and targeted actions to lower inventory levels; and accounts payable increased as a result of timing of payments for inventory purchases.\nThe following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nYear Ended December 31,\nNet cash flows provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\nInvesting activities\nFinancing activities\nOperating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities decreased $48.6 million to $668.1 million in 2024 primarily due to lower earnings and the timing of customer deposits and project deliveries as well as larger inventory reductions in the prior year period. Lower cash payments in 2024 compared to the prior year, including payments for taxes, variable compensation and interest, partially mitigated these items.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities increased $722.7 million in 2024. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased cash used in investing activities by $746.2 million during 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily related to the acquisition of Mott in 2024. This increase in cash outflows was partially offset by lower capital expenditures, which decreased cash used in investing activities by $24.8 million, as compared to 2023. For additional information on the Company’s acquisition and divestitures, refer to\n, “Acquisitions and Divestitures,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows provided by financing activities increased $810.6 million in 2024 primarily due to $774.3 million of net proceeds in connection with the financing of the acquisition of Mott in 2024, as compared with $100.0 million of net proceeds from borrowings in 2023. Additionally, repayments of long-term borrowings and revolving credit facilities were $130.9 million lower in 2024, and share repurchases were lower by $24.2 million in 2024, which were partly offset by higher dividends paid to shareholders, which increased $14.6 million in 2024.\nThe Company believes free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, is an important measure of performance because it provides a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for payment obligations such as operating cash requirements,\nplanned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements and quarterly dividend payments to holders of the Company’s common stock as well as\nfor funding acquisitions and share repurchases. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow conversion is calculated as free cash flow divided by adjusted net income attributable to IDEX.\nThe following table reconciles cash flows provided by operating activities to free cash flow:\nYear Ended December 31,\nCash flows provided by operating activities\nLess: capital expenditures\nReported net income attributable to IDEX\nAdjusted net income attributable to IDEX\nOperating cash flow as a percent of net income\nFree cash flow conversion\n\nPension and post-retirement medical benefit plans - See\n, “Retirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\nSubsequent Borrowings Activity\nDuring January 2025, the Company repaid $30.2 million of the $269.8 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility at December 31, 2024.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures generally include machinery and equipment that support growth and improved productivity, tooling, business system technology, replacement of equipment and investments in new facilities. The Company believes it has sufficient operating cash flows to continue to meet current obligations and invest in planned capital expenditures. C\nash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of $65.1 million and $89.9 million i\nThere were no share repurchases i\nThe Company repurchased 124,600 shares at a cost of $24.2 million in 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the amount of share repurchase authorization remaining was $539.7 million. During February 2025, the Company repurchased a total of 256,159 shares at a cost of $50.0 million. For additional information regarding the Company’s share repurchase program, refer to\n, “Share Repurchases,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company increased its quarterly cash dividend by 8% from $0.64 per common share in 2023 to $0.69 per common share in 2024. Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $205.3 million in 2024 compared with $190.7 million in 2023.\nThe key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Revolving Facility, the 3.37% Senior Notes and the 5.13% Senior Notes, are a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1. At December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants, as the Company’s interest coverage ratio was 16.09 to 1 for covenant calculation purposes and the leverage ratio was 2.20 to 1. There are no financial covenants relating to the 2.625% Senior Notes, the 3.00% Senior Notes and the 4.950% Senior Notes (each defined in\n, “Borrowings”); however, all are subject to cross-acceleration provisions. For a discussion of the Company’s Revolving Facility, Term Facility and Senior Notes as well as the associated covenants, refer to\n, “Borrowings,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company’s credit ratings, which were independently developed by the following credit agencies, are detailed below:\nS&P Global Ratings reaffirmed the Company’s corporate credit rating of BBB (stable outlook) in September 2024.\nMoody’s Investors Service affirmed the Company’s corporate credit rating of Baa2 (stable outlook) in August 2024.\nFitch Ratings reaffirmed the Company’s corporate credit rating of BBB+ (stable outlook) in June 2024.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company had $38.1 million of letters of credit as of December 31, 2024, primarily issued as security for insurance and other performance obligations. Of the $38.1 million of letters of credit, only $2.8 million reduced the Company’s borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2024. The Company has restricted cash of $18.1 million as of December 31, 2024, which represents cash held as collateral for standby letters of credit issued by Mott and is required to keep the balance in a separate account for the duration of the letters of credit.\nExcept as disclosed above, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company believes that the application of the following accounting policy, which is important to its financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of the Company’s accounting policies, including the accounting policy discussed below, see\n, “Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets\n— Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, which consists solely of trade names, are not amortized; rather they are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350,\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n, to test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company determines the fair",
