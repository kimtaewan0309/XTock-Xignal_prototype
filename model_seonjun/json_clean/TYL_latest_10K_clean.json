We are able to provide the majority of our software products through our SaaS model. The clients who choose this model typically do not wish to maintain, update and operate these systems directly, or make up-front capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies. The contract terms for these arrangements range from one to 10 years but are typically contracted for periods of generally one to three years. The majority of our SaaS or hosting arrangements include additional professional services as well as maintenance and support services.\nTransaction-based fees primarily relate to digital government services, online payment solutions (which are sometimes offered with the assistance of third-party vendors), and online dispute resolution solutions. Digital government services consist of websites and applications that allow consumers, such as businesses and citizens, to access government information, complete transactions and make electronic payments. Our online payments solution covers the entire payments life cycle, including billing, presentment, merchant onboarding, collections, reconciliation, and disbursements. We also provide electronic document filing solutions (“e-filing”) that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices.\nMaintenance and Support\nSupport is provided to clients over the phone or via the Internet through help desks staffed by our client support representatives. For more complicated issues, our staff, with the clients’ permission, can log on to clients’ systems remotely. We maintain our clients’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions of features and functionality, along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes.\nNearly all of our on-premises software clients contract with us for maintenance and support, which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue. We generally provide maintenance and support for our on-premises clients under annual, or in some cases multi-year, contracts, with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee. These fees can generally be increased on renewal and may also increase as new license fees increase. Maintenance and support fees are generally paid annually in advance. Most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the client or Tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration. Similar maintenance and support services are provided to our SaaS clients and are included in their subscription fees, which are classified as subscription-based revenue.\nProfessional Services\nWe provide a variety of professional services to clients who utilize our software products. Our clients contract with us for installation, training, and data conversion services in connection with their implementation of Tyler’s software solutions, whether through a SaaS arrangement or on-premise software license. The complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning, design, data conversion, set-up and testing. At the culmination of the implementation process, an implementation team is generally onsite at the client’s facility or available via remote video conferencing to help ensure the smooth go-live with the new system. Implementation fees are charged separately to clients on either a fixed-fee or hourly charge basis, depending on the contract.\nBoth in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis, we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services. Training can be provided in our training centers, onsite at clients’ locations, at meetings and conferences, or remotely, and can be customized to meet clients’ requirements. The vast majority of our clients contract with us for training services, both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems. Training services are generally billed on an hourly or daily basis, along with travel and other expenses.\nOur other sources of revenue include software licenses and royalties and computer hardware equipment, which represent 3% and 4% of total revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nSTRATEGY\nOur objective is to grow our revenues and earnings organically, supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions. The key components of our business strategy are to:\nProvide high quality, value–added products and services to our clients\n. We compete on the basis of, among other things, delivering to clients our deep domain expertise in government operations through the high value products and services in the market. We believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service provider to the public sector market.\nContinue to expand our product and service offerings\n. While we already have what we believe to be the broadest line of software products for the public sector, we continually strive to upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our clients. We regularly add new products and services to our portfolio through internal product development as well as acquisitions. We believe that the addition of new features and applications enhances the market appeal of our core products. We have also broadened our offerings of consulting and business process reengineering services.\nAccelerate our move to the cloud\n. We have offered most of our core products in both an on-premises license model and a cloud-based subscription model for several years and have seen a steady increase in the percentage of new software clients choosing our cloud model in recent years. Beginning in late 2019, we moved our approach to sales from “cloud-neutral” to “cloud-first,” with an increasing preference to provide our solutions in the cloud. We are making significant investments in optimizing our products to be deployed efficiently in the public cloud. Over a multi-year period we have been transitioning from hosting clients in Tyler’s proprietary data centers to utilizing Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for cloud hosting.\nExpand our client base\n. We seek to establish long-term relationships with new clients primarily through our sales and marketing efforts. While we currently have clients in all 50 states, Canada, the Caribbean, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other international locations, some of our solutions have not fully achieved nationwide geographic penetration. We intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by adding sales staff and targeting marketing efforts by solutions in those areas. We also intend to continue to expand our client base to include larger jurisdictions. While our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and mid-sized governments, our increased size and market presence, together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our solutions, are allowing us to achieve increasing success in selling to larger clients. We also expect to expand our presence in international markets by leveraging our leadership position in the United States through the disciplined pursuit of selected opportunities in other countries.\nExpand our existing client relationships\n. Our existing client base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and services that we currently offer, but that existing clients do not fully utilize. Add-on sales to existing clients typically involve lower sales and marketing expense than sales to new clients. In particular, since the acquisition of NIC Inc. (“NIC”) in April 2021, we have been successfully selling Tyler software products into NIC’s client base and in turn providing NIC’s payment services to Tyler’s client base. We expect those opportunities to contin",

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical in nature and typically address future or anticipated events, trends, expectations or beliefs with respect to our financial condition, results of operations or business. Forward-looking statements often contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “foresees,” “forecasts,” “estimates,” “plans,” “intends,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “projects,” “might,” “could” or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe our business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. We believe there is a reasonable basis for our forward-looking statements, but they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the forward-looking statements. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs: (1) changes in the budgets or regulatory environments of our clients, primarily local and state governments, that could negatively impact information technology spending; (2) disruption to our business and harm to our competitive position resulting from cyber-attacks, security vulnerabilities and software updates; (3) our ability to protect client information from security breaches and provide uninterrupted operations of data centers; (4) our ability to achieve growth or operational synergies through the integration of acquired businesses, while avoiding unanticipated costs and disruptions to existing operations; (5) material portions of our business require the Internet infrastructure to be adequately maintained; (6) our ability to achieve our financial forecasts due to various factors, including project delays by our clients, reductions in transaction size, fewer transactions, delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for service agreements; (7) general economic, political and market conditions, including continued inflation and rising interest rates; (8) technological and market risks associated with the development of new products or services or of new versions of existing or acquired products or services; (9) competition in the industry in which we conduct business and the impact of competition on pricing, client retention and pressure for new products or services; (10) the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and dealing with rising labor costs, the loss or retirement of key members of management or other key personnel; and (11) costs of compliance and any failure to comply with government and stock exchange regulations. These factors and other risks that affect our business are described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.\nOVERVIEW\nWe provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector. We develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the IT needs of public sector entities. We provide subscription-based services such as software as a service (“SaaS”) and transaction-based services primarily related to digital government services and payment processing. In addition, we provide professional IT services to our clients, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training, and for certain clients, product modifications, along with continuing maintenance and support for clients using our systems. Additionally, we provide property appraisal services for taxing\nWe report our results in two reportable segments. Our reportable segments are organized on the basis of a combination of the products and services they deliver to clients and the function the public sector client performs. Business units that have met the aggregation criteria have been combined into our two reportable segments. The Enterprise Software (“ES”) reportable segment provides public sector entities with software systems and services to meet their information technology and automation needs for mission-critical “back-office” functions such as: public administration solutions, courts and public safety solutions, education solutions, and property and recording solutions. The Platform Technologies (“PT”) reportable segment provides public sector entities with platform and transformative solutions including digital solutions, payment processing, streamlined data processing, and improved operations and workflows.\nThe primary financial measures used by the CODM for assessing performance and allocating resources are segment income or loss from operations. The CODM uses segment income or loss from operations before income taxes, not including gains and losses on investments, to allocate resources (including employees, property, and financial or capital resources) for each segment predominantly in the annual budget and forecasting process. Segment gross profit for our operating segments units is defined as gross profit before non-cash amortization of acquired software associated with acquisitions. Segment operating income for our reportable segments is defined as income before non-cash amortization of intangible assets associated with their acquisitions, interest expense, and income taxes. During the fiscal periods presented, we had no significant transaction between reportable segments. Corporate segment operating loss primarily consists of compensation costs for the executive management team, certain shared services staff, and share-based compensation expense for the entire company. Corporate segment operating loss also includes revenues and expenses related to a company-wide user conference. Certain presentation items from previous years have been adjusted to conform with current year presentation.\nWe did not complete any acquisitions during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024,.\nOn October 31, 2023, we acquired Resource Exploration, Inc. (“ResourceX”), a leading provider of budgeting software to the public sector, and ARInspect, Inc. (“ARInspect”), a leading provider of AI powered machine learning solutions for public sector field operations.\nOn August 8, 2023, we acquired Computing System Innovations, LLC (“CSI”), a leading provider of artificial intelligence automation, redaction, and indexing solution for courts, recorders, attorneys, and others.\nThe actual operating results of CSI and ResourceX are included in the operating results of the ES segment from their respective dates of acquisition. The operating results of ARInspect are included in the operating results of the PT segment since the date of acquisition.\n2024 Operating Results\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, total revenues increased 9.5% compared to the prior period. Revenues from recent acquisitions contributed $10.4 million or 0.5%, to the total revenue increase.\nSubscriptions revenue grew 15.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to an ongoing shift toward SaaS arrangements for both new and existing clients, along with growth in certain transaction-based revenues. We monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. These indicators include the following:\nRevenues – We derive our revenues from four primary sources: subscription-based arrangements from SaaS and transaction-based fees; maintenance; professional services; and software licenses and royalties. Subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately 84% of our revenues in 2024. The number of new SaaS clients and the number of existing clients who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our SaaS model are a significant driver of our revenue growth, together with transaction-based revenues and maintenance rate increases. In addition, we also monitor our client base and attrition, which historically is very low. During 2024, based on our number of clients, attrition was approximately 2%.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) - Subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources. ARR is calculated by annualizing the current quarter\ns recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions as reported in our statement of income. Management believes ARR is an indicator of the annual run rate of our recurring revenues, as well as a measure of the effectiveness of the strategies we deploy to drive revenue growth over time. ARR is a metric widely used by companies in the technology sector and by investors, which we believe offers insight to the stability of our maintenance and subscription revenues to be recognized within the year.\nSubscriptions revenues primarily consist of revenues derived from our SaaS arrangements and transaction-based fees. These revenues are considered recurring because revenues from these sources are expected to re-occur in similar annual amounts for the term of our relationship with the client. Transaction-based fees are generally the result of multi-year contracts with our clients that result in fees generated by payment transactions and digital government services and are collected on a recurring basis during the contract term. Transaction-based revenues are historically highest in the second quarter, which coincides with peak outdoor recreation seasons and statutory filing deadlines in many jurisdictions, and lowest in the fourth quarter due to fewer business days and lower transaction volumes around holidays. Because ARR is an annualized revenue amount, the metric can fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to this seasonality. ARR was $1.86 billion and $1.61 billion as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. ARR increased approximately 15% compared to the prior period primarily due to an increase in subscriptions revenue resulting from an ongoing shift toward SaaS arrangements for both new and existing clients and expansion in transaction-based fees.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margins – Our primary cost components are hosting costs and personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation, subscription-based services and maintenance and support to our clients. We can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base, especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with relatively low incremental cost, such as subscription-based services, maintenance and support and software licenses and royalties. Continued migration of clients to our SaaS products and consolidation of versions of on-premises software products with support obligations could decrease support costs with resources redeployed toward development. As of December 31, 2024, our total employee count included in cost of revenues increased to 5,250 from 5,129 at December 31, 2023.\nSales and Marketing (“S&M”) Expense – The primary components of S&M expense include sales personnel salaries and share-based compensation expense, sales commissions, travel-related expenses, advertising and marketing materials, and allocated depreciation, facilities, and IT support. Sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and share-based compensation expense generally increases based on increased levels of awards issued during the period and as the market price of our stock increases. Other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative (“G&A”) Expense – The primary components of G&A expense include personnel salaries and share-based compensation expense for general corporate functions, including senior management, finance, accounting, legal, human resources and corporate development, third-party professional fees, travel-related expenses, insurance, allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, acquisition-related expenses and other administrative expenses. Share-based compensation expense generally increases based on increased level of awards issued during the period and as the market price of our stock increases. Other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues.\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expense – These costs include compensation costs for engineering and product management personnel, third-party contractor expenses, software development tools and other expenses related to researching and developing new solutions or upgrading and enhancing existing solutions that do not qualify for capitalization, and allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs. As of December 31, 2024, our total employee count included in R&D expense increased to 870 from 830 at December 31, 2023\nLiquidity and Cash Flows – The primary driver of our cash flows is net income. Uses of cash include acquisitions, capital investments in property and equipment and software development, debt repayment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock. Our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from clients in advance of revenue being earned, offset by cash outflows, primarily payment of personnel expenses. In recent years, we have also received significant amounts of cash from employees exercising stock options and contributing to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nBalance Sheet – Cash, accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business.\nARR was $1.86 billion and $1.61 billion as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, an increase of approximately 15% compared to the prior period. The public sector software market continues to experience heightened activity. We expect to continue to achieve solid growth in revenues and earnings. With our strong financial position and cash flow, we plan to continue to make significant investments in product development and continue to accelerate our move to the cloud to better position us to continue to expand our addressable market and strengthen our competitive position over the long term.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared following the requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Notes to the Financial Statements included as part of this Annual Report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets and estimated useful lives of intangible assets, the application of the progress toward completion methods of revenue recognition, estimation for revenue recognition and multiple performance obligation arrangements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require significant ju",
