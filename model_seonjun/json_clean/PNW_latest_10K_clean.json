  "item1_clean": "FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services. See Note 3 for information regarding APS’s transmission rates. During 2024, approximately 4.2% of APS’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services. APS’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements. APS also sells, in the wholesale market, its generation output that is not needed for APS’s Native Load and, in doing so, competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers. Additionally, subject to specified parameters, APS hedges both electricity and natural gas. The majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in APS’s portfolio.\nTransmission and Delivery\nAPS continues to work closely with customers, stakeholders, and regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that support new customers, system reliability, access to markets and clean energy development. The capital expenditures table presented in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this report includes new APS transmission projects, along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements, including those for data center and semi-conductor manufacturing development. To prioritize reliability and meet substantial growth in residential and commercial energy needs, APS has developed a future-focused, strategic transmission plan (the “Ten-Year Transmission Plan”). The Ten-Year Transmission Plan includes five critical transmission projects that comprise the APS strategic transmission portfolio, which represents a significant upgrade to APS’s transmission system. These five projects, along with other projects included in the Ten-Year Transmission Plan, are intended to support growing energy needs, strengthen reliability, and allow for the connection of new resources.\nAPS is also working to establish and expand advanced grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide long-term benefits both to APS and its customers. APS is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better manage their energy usage, minimize system outage durations and frequency, enable customer choice for new customer sited technologies, and facilitate greater cost savings to APS through improved reliability and the automation of certain delivery functions.\nEnvironmental Matters\nLegislative Initiatives.\nThere have been no recent successful attempts by Congress to pass legislation that would regulate GHG emissions, and it is unclear at this time whether legislation regulating or limiting utility-sector GHG emissions introduced during prior sessions of Congress will become law. In the event climate change legislation ultimately passes, the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on APS depends on a variety of factors, none of which can be fully known until a law is written, enacted, and the specifics of the resulting program are established. These factors include, without limitation, the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed GHG emissions; the cost to reduce emissions; in the event a cap-and-trade program is established, whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned (and, if so, the cost of those allowances in the marketplace) and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available;\nand, in the event of a carbon tax, the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide (“CO\n”) equivalent emitted.\nIn addition to federal legislative initiatives, state-specific initiatives may also impact our business. While Arizona has no pending legislation regulating GHGs, the California legislature enacted AB 32 and Senate Bill (“SB”) 1368 in 2006 to address GHG emissions. In October 2011, the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) approved final regulations that established a state-wide cap on GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2013, and established a GHG allowance trading program under that cap. The first phase of the program, which applies to, among other entities, importers of electricity, commenced on January 1, 2013. Under the program, entities selling electricity into California, including APS, must hold carbon allowances to cover GHG emissions associated with electricity sales into California from outside the state. APS is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the PSA.\nThe California legislature also enacted SB 219, SB 253, and SB 261, which mandate climate-related disclosures for certain companies doing business in California. CARB is expected to issue regulations for these bills in 2025. Pinnacle West and APS are currently reviewing whether they would be required to make disclosures pursuant to these bills.\nRegulatory Initiatives.\nIn 2009, EPA determined that GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare. As a result of this “endangerment finding,” EPA determined that the Clean Air Act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major GHG emitting sources, including power plants. APS will generally be required to consider the impact of GHG emissions as part of its traditional New Source Review analysis for new major sources and major modifications to existing plants.\nEPA’s regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from electric utility power plants has proceeded in fits and starts over most of the last decade. Starting on August 3, 2015, EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, which was the Agency’s first effort at such regulation through system-wide generation dispatch shifting. Those regulations were subsequently repealed by the EPA on June 19, 2019, and replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) regulations, which were a far narrower set of rules. While the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit subsequently vacated the ACE regulations on January 19, 2021, and ordered a remand for EPA to develop replacement regulations consistent with the original 2015 Clean Power Plan, the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently reversed that decision on June 30, 2022, holding that the Clean Power Plan exceeded EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.\nIn the final regulations governing power plant carbon dioxide emissions released April 25, 2024, EPA issued emission standards and guidelines for various subcategories of new and existing power plants. Unlike EPA’s Clean Power Plan regulations from 2015, which took a broad, system-wide approach to regulating carbon emissions from electric utility fossil-fuel burning power plants, these new federal regulations are limited to measures that can be installed at individual power plants to limit planet-warming carbon-dioxide emissions.\nAs such, for new natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants, EPA is proposing that carbon emission performance standards apply based on the annual capacity factors. For the highest utilization combustion turbines, EPA is therefore proposing that such facilities be retrofitted for carbon capture and sequestration or utilization controls (“CCS”) by 2032. For intermediate or low-load natural gas fired combustion turbines, those with 40% or less capacity factors, EPA’s regulations would not require add-on pollution controls. Instead, natural gas-fired combustion turbines with capacity factors of up to 20% would be effectively unregulated, while such turbines with capacity factors over 20% and up to 40% would be subject to carbon dioxide emission rate limitations. EPA did not finalize standards for existing natural gas-\nfired combustion turbines but has indicated that it will propose a new set of standards, initiating a separate rulemaking, for these existing gas-fired power plants within the next year.\nFor coal-fired power plants, instead of imposing regulations based on capacity and utilization, EPA has finalized subcategories based on planned retirement dates. This means that facilities retiring before 2032 are effectively exempt from regulation, those that retire between 2032 and 2038 must co-fire with natural gas starting in 2030, and those that retire in 2039 or later must install CCS controls by 2032.\nAs of May 10, 2024, several states, electric utility companies, affiliated trade associations, and other entities filed petitions for review of these regulations in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. APS is participating in that litigation as part of an ad hoc coalition of electric utility companies, independent power producers, and trade groups, called Electric Generators for a Sensible Transition. We cannot predict the outcome of the litigation challenging EPA’s latest carbon emission standards for power plants. In addition, the Trump administration has stated that it intends to reverse or substantially revise these standards. We cannot predict the outcome of future rulemaking or other regulatory proceedings aimed at changing or eliminating the current EPA emission standards for power plants.\nIf this regulation remains in effect, it will likely lead to a material increase in APS’s costs to build, operate, and maintain new, frequently operated gas-fired power plants. The regulatory deadlines in 2032 by which new, frequently operated gas-fired power plants must install carbon capture and sequestration and achieve 90% capture efficiency may not be feasible. Future resource plans and procurement efforts implicating the development of such new generation remains pending and, as such, at this time APS is not able to quantify the financial impact associated with EPA’s GHG regulations for power plants.\nOther environmental rules that could involve material compliance costs include those related to effluent limitations, the ozone national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) and other rules or matters involving the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, RCRA, Superfund, the Navajo Nation, and water supplies for our power plants. The financial impact of complying with current and future environmental rules could jeopardize the economic viability of APS’s fossil-fuel powered plants or the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any required equipment upgrades or continue their participation in these plants. The economics of continuing to own certain resources, particularly our coal plants, may deteriorate, warranting early retirement of those plants, which may result in asset impairments. APS would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery.\n\nAPS currently provides electric service to approximately 1.4 million customers. We own or lease 6,540 MW of regulated generation capacity and we hold a mix of both long-term and short-term purchased power agreements for additional capacity. During 2024, no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 1.4% of our electric revenues.\nThe following map shows APS’s retail service territory, including the locations of its generating facilities and principal transmission lines.\nEnergy Sources and Resource Planning\nTo serve its customers, APS obtains power through its various generation stations and through purchased power agreements. Resource planning is an important function necessary to meet Arizona’s future energy needs. APS’s sources of energy by type used to supply energy to Native Load customers during 2024 were approximately as follows:\n*Utility Scale Renewables include energy from biogas, biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind.\nThe share of APS’s energy supply being derived from clean resources was approximately 54% in 2024, which includes energy from nuclear, renewables and DSM.\nClean Energy Focus Initiatives\nIn response to climate change, APS has undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce carbon, ",

The following table summarizes the major components of this change:\n(dollars in millions)\nImpact of new rates from the 2022 Rate Case, effective March 8, 2024 (Note 3)\nHigher retail revenue due to changes in usage patterns and customer growth partially offset by the impacts of energy efficiency and related pricing\nCRS revenue (Note 3)\nHigher renewable energy regulatory surcharges, partially offset by operations and maintenance costs\nLFCR revenue (Note 3)\nChanges in net fuel and purchased power costs, including off-system sales margins and related deferrals\nLower transmission revenues (Note 3)\nOperations and maintenance\n. Operations and maintenance expenses increased $106 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period primarily due to:\nan increase of $27 million related to information technology costs;\nan increase of $25 million related to transmission, distribution, and customer service costs;\nan increase of $20 million related to non-nuclear generation costs, primarily due to increased planned outages;\nan increase of $16 million related to employee benefit costs;\nan increase of $14 million related to costs for renewable energy programs and similar regulatory programs, which are partially offset in operating revenues and purchased power;\nan increase of $7 million related to corporate resource costs;\na decrease of $3 million for other miscellaneous factors.\nDepreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $101 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to increased plant in service and intangible assets.\nInterest charges, net of allowance for borrowed funds and equity funds used during construction.\nInterest charges, net of AFUDC, were $60 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to higher debt balances and higher interest rates in the current period, higher allowance for borrowed funds and lower allowance for equity funds.\nOther income and expenses, net.\nOther income and expenses, net were $4 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the gain on the sale of BCE, partially offset by higher corporate giving expense. See Note 16. The difference between APS’s and Pinnacle West’s other income and expense, net is primarily related to Pinnacle West’s gain on the sale of BCE.\nIncome taxes were $34 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period, primarily due to higher pre-tax income, and lower tax benefits from AFUDC equity, partially offset by higher tax credits.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nThe system will also integrate a new meter data management system that will increase grid visibility and give customers access to more of their energy usage data.\nWildfire safety remains a critical focus for APS and other utilities. We have increased investment in fire mitigation efforts to clear defensible space around our infrastructure, continue ongoing system upgrades, build partnerships with government entities and first responders and educate customers and communities. We also increased spend on mitigating the risk associated with trees that could cause hazards, resulting in more of these trees being removed before they could cause outages or wildfires. These programs contribute to customer reliability, responsible forest management and safe communities. With recent wildfire events in Hawaii, California, and across North America, we have been devoting and will continue to devote substantial efforts to analyzing and developing enhancements to our systems and processes to mitigate fire risk within our service territory and communities, including by hardening our infrastructure, deploying new technologies where appropriate, increasing our awareness, implementing operational changes, and enhancing our wildfire response capabilities. APS completed implementation of fire modelling software that we are utilizing to more surgically identify and calculate risk and target future\nsystem improvement investments such as fire-resistant pole wrapping, wood to steel pole conversions, and additional remote-controllable field devices like reclosers and switches. In 2024, APS began installing a system of artificial intelligence-based fire sensing cameras with the ability to detect and alert on fire ignitions. These alerts are sent both to APS and fire response dispatch centers to speed fire response in APS’s service territory regardless of the cause of the fire. APS also implemented a PSPS program on certain feeders that began in the 2024 fire season, leveraging the additional real-time analysis provided by the new modelling software, and has educated and is continuing education outreach to customers and communities that may potentially be impacted by the PSPS program. APS continues to evaluate policy and regulatory options, as well as insurance programs, to mitigate the impact of wildfire events.\nFor example, on August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. See Note 3 for more information.\nAdditionally, APS was selected by the DOE’s Grid Deployment Office (“GDO”) to receive up to $70 million in federal money for fire mitigation and grid infrastructure projects. This funding is part of the GDO’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership Program and is contingent on APS negotiating and executing final grant agreements with GDO.\nMaintaining reliability and affordability for customers during the clean energy transition is fundamental to APS’s strategy.\nDispatchable natural gas generators provide energy during times when intermittent resources, such as solar and wind, are insufficient to meet customer demand.\nIn addition to the previously added natural gas units at the modernized Ocotillo Power Plant in 2019 and efficiency improvements to gas units at the Redhawk, Sundance, and West Phoenix Power Plants in 2024, APS has contracted for two simple cycle combustion turbines (approximately 90 MW in total) at Sundance, which are expected to be in service in 2026, and eight simple cycle combustion turbines (approximately 397 MW in total) at Redhawk, which are expected to be in service in 2028.\n\nOn June 21, 2023, the ACC approved the joint resolution and proposals therein for recovery through the CRS mechanism, which became effective on July 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, $26.2 million\nof the $59.6 million of lost revenue has been recovered.\nFinally, the CRS tariff has been updated to account for changes to return on equity and depreciation and deferral adjustments approved in Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case.\nRegulatory Lag Docket\nOn January 5, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to explore the possibility of modifications to the ACC’s historical test year rules. The ACC requested comments and held two workshops exploring ways to reduce regulatory lag, including alternative ratemaking structures such as future test years, hybrid test years, and formula rates. On December 3, 2024, the ACC approved a policy statement regarding formula rate plans. The policy statement allows regulated utilities to propose formula rate plans in future rate cases. Proposed plans must be based on a historical test year, include an annual update with a true-up and an earnings test to ensure a utility earns within a 20 basis points band of its authorized return on equity. Proposed plans should also include an annual meeting and challenge periods for stakeholder feedback. Utilities that implement formula rates also must file a full rate case at least every five years unless an alternate schedule is set by the ACC. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nOn August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order associated with unrecovered book value and closure costs of the remaining Cholla units. This order would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, both the expenses necessary to close and decommission coal-fired power plant infrastructure at Cholla, including legally required site environmental remediation, CCR corrective actions, the closure of CCR management facilities, and any unrecovered plant investment and operating costs incurred through and after April 2025. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nOn August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nSee Note 3 for information regarding additional regulatory matters.\nCaptive Insurance Cell\nPinnacle West is the primary beneficiary of\n\nRetail customers in APS’s service territory increased 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period. For the three years through 2024, APS’s customer growth averaged 2.1% per year. We currently project annual customer growth to be 1.5% to 2.5% for 2025 and the average annual growth to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% through 2027 based on anticipated steady population growth in Arizona during that period.\nRetail electricity sales in kWh, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, increased 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period. While steady customer growth was somewhat offset by weaker usage among residential customers, energy savings driven by customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, the main drivers of positive sales for this period were continued strong sales to commercial and industrial customers and the ramp-up of new data center and large manufacturing customers.\nFor the three years through 2024, annual retail electricity sales growth averaged 3.2%, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations. Due to the expected growth of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kWh will increase in the range of 4.0% to 6.0% for 2025 and that average annual growth will be in the range of 4.0% to 6.0% through 2027, including the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable\ngeneration initiatives, but excluding the effects of weather variations. These projected sales growth ranges include the impacts of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, which are expected to contribute to 2025 growth in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% and to average annual growth in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% through 2027.\nLonger term, APS has been preparing for and can serve significant load growth from residential and business customers. On top of these existing growth trends, APS is also now receiving unprecedented incremental requests for service from extra-large commercial energy users (over 25 MW) with very high energy demands that persist virtually around-the-clock. These incremental requests for service by extra-large energy users far exceed available generation and transmission resource capacity in the Southwest region for the foreseeable future. In April 2023, APS notified prospective extra-large customers without existing commitments from APS that it is not able to commit at this time to future extra-large projects of over 25 MW. Because of the high growth in demand for such projects, APS has developed a prioritization queue that identifies and prioritizes projects while maintaining system reliability and affordability for existing APS customers. APS is exploring available options for securing sufficient electric generation and transmission to meet these projections of future customer needs.\nActual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns and energy conservation, slower ramp-up of and/or fewer data centers and large manufacturing facilities, slower than expected commercial and industrial expansions, impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in DG, responses to retail price changes, changes in regulatory standards, and impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations. Based on past experience, a 1% variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $24 million, and a 1% variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $6 million.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties, judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved.\nRegulatory Accounting\nRegulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators, such as the ACC and FERC, to be reflected in our financial statements. Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.\nManagement judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets and/or a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction. This determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in Arizona and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings, except for pension benefits, which would be charged to OCI and result in lower future earnings. Management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential ACC- or FERC-ordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities. We had $1,810 million of regulatory assets and $2,062 million of regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024. See Notes 1 and 3 for more information.\nPensions a",
