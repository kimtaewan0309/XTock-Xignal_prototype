  "item1_clean": "Our Bank segment reflects the results of our banking operations, including the results of Raymond James Bank, a Florida-chartered state member bank, and TriState Capital Bank, a Pennsylvania-chartered state member bank. We provide various types of loans, including securities-based loans (“SBL”), corporate loans (commercial and industrial (“C&I”), commercial real estate (“CRE”), and real estate investment trust (“REIT”) loans), residential mortgage loans, and tax-exempt loans. Our Bank segment is active in corporate loan syndications and participations and lending directly to clients. We also provide Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured deposit accounts, including to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, and other retail and corporate deposit and liquidity management products and services. The Bank segment generates net interest income principally through the interest income earned on loans and an investment portfolio of available-for-sale securities, which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings.\nAs of September 30, 2025, SBL and residential mortgage loans held for investment represented 46% of the Bank segment’s total assets. SBL are primarily collateralized by the borrower’s marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards and, to a lesser extent, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies issued by investment-grade insurance companies. An insignificant portion of our SBL portfolio is collateralized by private securities or other financial instruments with a limited trading market. Residential mortgage loans are originated or purchased and held for investment or sold in the secondary market. Corporate and tax exempt loans held for investment represented 33% of the Bank segment’s total assets as of September 30, 2025, and 66% of such loans were U.S. or Canadian syndicated loans. The remainder of our corporate loan portfolio is comprised of smaller participations and direct loans. The Bank segment’s investment portfolio is classified as available-for-sale and is primarily comprised of agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), agency collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), U.S. Treasury securities (“U.S. Treasuries”), and other securities which are guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies. Raymond James Bank’s liabilities primarily consist of cash deposits, including cash swept from the investment accounts of PCG clients through the RJBDP and deposits in our Enhanced Savings Program (“ESP”), in which PCG clients may deposit cash in a FDIC-insured high-yield Raymond James Bank account. Deposits at TriState Capital Bank are primarily corporate and retail money market deposits, including RJBDP sweep deposits, and interest-bearing demand deposits. Our Bank segment’s liabilities also include borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”).\nThe following graph details the composition of our Bank segment’s total assets as of September 30, 2025.\nBank Segment Total Assets — $65.26 billion\nOur Other segment includes interest income on certain corporate cash balances, our private equity investments, which predominantly consist of investments in third-party funds, certain other corporate investing activity, and certain corporate overhead costs of RJF that are not allocated to other segments, including the interest costs on our public debt, certain provisions for legal and regulatory matters, and certain acquisition-related expenses.\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nOur “associates” (which include our employee financial advisors and all of our other employees) and our independent contractor financial advisors (which we call our “independent advisors”) are vital to our success. As a human capital-intensive business, our ability to attract, develop, and retain exceptional associates and independent advisors is critical, not only in the current competitive labor market, but also to our long-term success. It is important to us to maintain a strong commitment to a workplace environment that attracts talented candidates who reflect the skills and experiences required to meet our clients’ needs and are drawn from the entire available talent pool. To compete effectively, we must offer attractive compensation and health and wellness programs, as well as provide formal and informal opportunities for associates and advisors to develop their capabilities and reach their full potential. We also endeavor to foster and maintain our unique and long-standing values-based culture.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had approximately 19,500 associates (including 3,878 employee financial advisors) and 5,065 independent advisors. This reflects an increase of approximately 500 associates compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued growth across the firm. Our associates are largely spread across four countries in North America and Europe. However, the vast majority of our associates are located in the U.S. Of our global associates, 44% self-identify as women, and among our U.S.-based associates, 22% self-identify as people of color.\nWe strive to attract individuals who are people-focused and share our values. Our values are memorialized in a document we refer to as our culture “blueprint” that is communicated to all associates. Our culture is people-focused and rooted in the values established at the firm’s foundation. Our pledge to clients, to our advisors, and to all of our associates is that:\nwe put clients first,\nwe act with integrity,\nwe think long term, and\nwe value independence.\nOne way in which we measure the health of our culture is through firmwide and targeted surveys in which we routinely ask our associates about their experiences at the firm. Feedback provided through these surveys is also used to create and continually enhance programs that support our associates’ needs.\nRecruitment, talent development, and retention\nWe seek to build a workforce that provides outstanding client service and helps clients achieve their financial goals. We are also committed to maintaining a workforce that is reflective of our client base and the communities in which we work, as well as a work environment that is a natural extension of our culture. We have a comprehensive approach to identifying and selecting new associates and enhancing the skills of our existing associates. We also offer internships to selected college students, professionals returning to the workforce, and veterans, which may lead to permanent roles, and we offer pipeline programs which accelerate the progression from entry level positions for recent graduates across many areas of the firm. Our recruiting approach is designed to attract a wide range of candidates for every role. To that end, we have built strong relationships with a variety of industry associations that represent professionals from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, as well as with similar groups at the colleges and universities where we recruit.\nWe are also committed to supporting associates in reaching their professional goals. Through our annual performance review process, associates and managers collaborate to define performance goals which are reviewed during mid-year touch points and formal end-of-year discussions. We also offer associates the opportunity to participate in a variety of development programs. Our extensive program catalog includes courses designed to expand our associates’ industry, product, technical, professional, business development, and regulatory knowledge. The firm also provides leadership development programs that prepare our leaders for challenges they will face in new roles or with expanded responsibilities. The firm also offers a mentoring program to all associates who seek additional guidance and advice on their career growth. In alignment with our focus on human capital development and a people-centric culture, we offer voluntary inclusion networks open to all associates and advisors. These networks foster connection and understanding, and support our broader associate experience strategy focused on career growth, engagement, and well-being. To provide associates opportunity to compete for new positions, we require that all roles, with the exception of certain revenue-generating positions and certain senior-level roles, be posted on our internal online career platform. We conduct ongoing and robust succession planning for roles that are within two levels of our Executive Leadership Team, and we strive to ensure we have a robust pool of candidates for such roles. We discuss the results with executive leadership and the Board of Directors several times per year.\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAn important driver of our success is the continuous recruitment and retention of financial advisors. Our ability to attract high quality advisors is based on our values-based culture, our commitment to service, and the unique ways in which we provide services to our financial advisors. Individuals who want to become financial advisors can gain relevant branch experience through our Wealth Management Associate Program or move to our Advisor Mastery Program and begin building their client base. We have a department dedicated to providing growth-oriented tools and resources, including business coaching, to our financial advisors. We also offer these advisors the opportunity to participate in conferences and workshops. These include separate national conferences for our employee and independent contractor financial advisor channels, each of which is attended by thousands of advisors each year.\nWe also monitor and evaluate various turnover and attrition metrics. Retaining associates, including financial advisors, and their clients, is a key component of our “Service 1\n” philosophy and critical to the success of our business. Our overarching commitment to the attraction, development, and retention of our associates results in a relatively low voluntary turnover rate. For the year ended September 30, 2025, our domestic financial advisor retention remained very strong.\nCompensation and benefits\nWe have designed a compensation structure, including an array of benefit plans and programs, that is intended to be attractive to current and prospective associates, while also reinforcing our core values and mitigating excessive risk taking. Our competitive pay packages include base salary, incentive bonus, and equity compensation programs. Additionally, the firm makes annual contributions to support the retirement goals of each associate through our employee stock ownership plan and our profit-sharing plan, in addition to a matching contribution program for the 401(k) retirement savings plan, for our U.S.-based associates. We also offer U.S.-based associates the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan that enables them to acquire our common stock at a discount, further increasing their ability to participate in the growth and success of the firm. As an additional retention tool, we may grant equity awards in connection with initial employment or under various retention programs for individuals who are responsible for contributing to our management, growth, and/or profitability. For certain associates who meet compensation, production, or other criteria, we also offer various non-qualified deferred compensation plans that provide a return to the participant, as well as a retention tool to the firm.\nWe strive to design programs that promote equitable rewards for all associates. Our compensation practices are structured to verify that all associates are paid fairly based on objective criteria such as role, experience, performance, and qualifications. Each year, we conduct pay equity studies in the U.S., UK, and Canada. If we identify any gaps, we take remediation steps as part of our compensation strategy.\nThe physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates is a h",
  "item7_clean": "RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTotal clients’ domestic cash sweep and ESP balances decreased 3% compared with September 30, 2024, with decreases in both RJBDP balances and the ESP. PCG segment results can be impacted by not only changes in the level of client cash balances, but also by the allocation of client cash balances between the RJBDP, the CIP, and the ESP, as the PCG segment may earn different amounts from each of these client cash destinations, depending on multiple factors.\nYear ended September 30, 2025 compared with the year ended September 30, 2024\nNet revenues of $10.18 billion increased 8% while pre-tax income of $1.72 billion decreased 4%.\nAsset management and related administrative fees increased $734 million, or 14%, primarily due to higher assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of each of the current-year quarterly billing periods compared with the prior-year billing periods resulting from market-driven appreciation and net new assets, due to the favorable impact of our advisor recruiting and retention.\nBrokerage revenues increased $106 million, or 6%, primarily due to higher client activity in the current year.\nAccount and service fees decreased $123 million, or 6%, primarily due to a decrease in RJBDP fees largely resulting from a decrease in the average RJBDP third-party bank yield. RJBDP fees from third-party banks decreased by a greater amount than RJBDP fees from our Bank segment as average balances swept to third-party banks declined due to a higher allocation of balances swept to our Bank segment, which increased compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting the decline in total RJBDP fees, mutual fund service fees increased primarily due to higher average mutual fund assets.\nCompensation-related expenses increased $684 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher commission expense resulting from higher compensable revenues, including asset management and related administrative fees and brokerage revenues, as well as an increase in compensation costs to support our growth, including higher financial advisor recruiting-related expenses, and annual salary increases.\nNon-compensation expenses increased $104 million, or 11%, compared with the prior year primarily due to higher expenses to support our growth, including investments in technology and financial advisor recruiting activities. In addition, the current year included higher expenses related to legal and regulatory matters as the prior year reflected a net reserve release which did not reoccur in the current year.\nYear ended September 30, 2024 compared with the year ended September 30, 2023\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS – CAPITAL MARKETS\nOur Capital Markets segment conducts investment banking, institutional sales and trading of financial instruments, equity research, and the syndication and management of investments in low-income housing funds and funds of a similar nature, the majority of which qualify for tax credits.\nWe provide various investment banking services, including merger & acquisition advisory, and other advisory services, underwriting and placement of public and private equity and debt securities for corporate clients, private capital fundraising, and public financing activities. Revenues from investment banking activities are driven principally by our role in the transaction and the number and sizes of the transactions in which we are involved.\nWe earn brokerage revenues for the sale of both equity and fixed income products to institutional clients, as well as from our market-making activities in fixed income debt instruments. Client activity is influenced by a combination of general market\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nactivity and our Capital Markets group’s ability to find attractive investment opportunities for clients. In certain cases, we transact on a principal basis, which involves the purchase of financial instruments from, and the sale of financial instruments to, our clients as well as other dealers who may be purchasing or selling financial instruments for their own account or acting on behalf of their clients. Profits and losses related to this activity are primarily derived from the spreads between bid and ask prices, as well as market trends for the individual securities during the period we hold them. To facilitate such transactions, we carry inventories of financial instruments. In our fixed income businesses, we also enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts to facilitate client transactions or to actively manage risk exposures.\n\nYear ended September 30, 2025 compared with the year ended September 30, 2024\nNet revenues of $1.78 billion increased 3% and pre-tax income of $491 million increased 29%.\nNet interest income increased $59 million, or 4%, primarily due to the impact of higher average interest-earning assets, particularly securities-based loans, partially offset by the impact of lower short-term interest rates. The Bank segment net interest margin increased slightly to 2.68% from 2.67% for the prior year.\nThe bank loan provision for credit losses was $37 million for the current year, a decrease of $8 million compared with $45 million for the prior year. The bank loan provision for credit losses for the current year primarily reflected the impacts of loan downgrades, charge-offs, and specific reserves on certain loans, partially offset by the favorable impacts of an improved economic forecast and reserve releases related to certain loan sales and paydowns. The bank loan provision for credit losses for the prior year primarily reflected the impacts of loan growth, specific reserves, loan downgrades, and charge-offs in our C&I and CRE loan portfolios, partially offset by the favorable impacts of an improved economic forecast, loan repayments, and loan sales in the C&I loan portfolio.\nNon-compensation expenses, excluding the bank loan provision for credit losses, decreased $47 million, or 4%, primarily due to a decrease of $70 million, or 8%, in RJBDP fees paid to PCG, partially offset by higher expenses related to our growth. The Bank segment RJBDP fees paid to PCG and related revenues earned by the PCG segment are eliminated in consolidation.\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nYear ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ended September 30, 2023\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS – OTHER\n\n30, 2026. We are prepared to comply with the rule as of its effective date and do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial position.\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, enacting significant changes to the U.S. tax code. Among its many provisions, those with the largest impact on our firm include the restoration of accelerated depreciation provisions (i.e., bonus depreciation), immediate expensing for domestic research and development costs (reversing prior amortization requirements), modifications to certain U.S. international tax provisions enacted under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a new limitation on charitable contributions whereby deductions will only be permitted for amounts exceeding 1% of taxable income, and the eventual phaseout of certain renewable energy tax credit programs. The changes to renewable energy programs do not impact tax credits applicable to our existing renewable energy equity investments. The accelerated depreciation provisions were effective for the year ended September 30, 2025 and did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or effective income tax rate. We do not expect the remaining provisions, which have varying effective dates, to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.\nIn August 2023, Raymond James Investment Services Limited, one of our U.K. subsidiaries, agreed to a Voluntary Application for Imposition of Requirements (“VREQ”) with the FCA that prohibits the onboarding of new branches or financial advisors without the prior consent of the FCA. This VREQ has not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, and we do not expect it to have a material impact in the future.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nDue to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position. We believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions, those described in the following sections involve a high degree of judgment and complexity.\nAllowance for credit losses\nWe evaluate certain of our financial assets, including bank loans, to estimate an allowance for credit losses based on expected credit losses over a financial asset’s lifetime. The remaining life of our financial assets is determined by considering contractual terms and expected prepayments, among other factors. We use multiple methodologies in estimating an allowance for credit losses and our approaches differ by type of financial asset and the risk characteristics within each financial asset type. Our estimates are based on ongoing evaluations of our financial assets, the related credit risk characteristics, and the overall economic and environmental conditions affecting the financial assets. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses includes a complex analysis of several quantitative and qualitative factors requiring significant management judgment due to matters that are inherently uncertain. This uncertainty can produce volatility in our allowance for credit losses. In addition, the allowance for credit losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. In such an event, any losses in excess of our allowance would result in a decrease in our net income, as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital.\nWe generally estimate the allowance for credit losses on bank loans using credit risk models which incorporate relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and, most notably, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. After testing the reasonableness of a variety of economic forecast scenarios, each model is run using a single forecast scenario selected for each model. Our forecasts incorporate assumptions related to macroeconomic indicators including, but not limited to, U.S. gross domestic product, equity market indices, unemployment rates, and commercial real estate and residential home price indices.\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates on our bank loan portfolio to macroeconomic forecasts, we compared our modeled estimates under the base case economic scenario used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2025 to what our estimate would have been under a downside case scenario and an upside case scenario, without considering any offsetting effects in the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses. As of September 30, 2025, use of the downside case scenario would have resulted in an increase of approximately $170 million in the quantitative portion of our allowance for credit losses on bank loans, while the use of the upside case scenario would have resulted in a reduction of\nRAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\napproximately $25 million in the quantitative portion of our allowance for credit losses on bank loans. These hypothetical outcomes reflect the relative sensitivity of the modeled portion of our allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecasted scenarios but do not consider any potential impact qualitative adjustments could have on the allowance for credit losses in such environments. Qualitative adjustments could either increase or decrease modeled loss estimates calculated using an alternative economic scenario assumption. Further, such sensitivity calculations do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the related allowance for a number of reasons including: (1) management’s predictions of future economic trends and relationships among the scenarios may differ from actual events; and (2) management’s application of subjective measures to modeled results through the qualitative portion of the allowance for credit losses when appropriate. The downside case scenario utilized in this hypothetical sensitivity analysis assumes a moderate recession. To the extent macroeconomic conditions worsen beyond those assumed in this downside case scenario, we could incur provisions for credit losses significantly in excess of those estimated in this analysis.\nLoss provisions for legal and regulatory matters\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued amended guidance related to disclosures for income taxes (ASU 2023-09). The amendment requires a public entity to enhance its existing annual tabular reconciliation of its statutory income tax rate to its effective tax rate, with certain reconciling items at or above 5% of the applicable statutory income tax rate broken out by nature and/or jurisdiction. The guidance also requires an entity to disclose income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, and net amounts paid to an individual jurisdiction when they represent 5% or more of the total income taxes paid. This new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning in our fiscal 2026 with early adoption permitted, although we do not plan to early adopt. This guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with retrospective application permitted. Since this amendment only requires additional disclosures, adoption of this ASU will not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued amended guidance related to disclosure of disaggregated expenses (ASU 2024-03). This amendment requires public business entities to provide detailed disclosures in the notes to financial statements disaggregating specific expense categories, including employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization, as well as certain other disclosures to provide enhanced transparency into the nature and function of expenses. This new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning in our fiscal 2028 and interim periods beginning in our fiscal first quarter of 2029 with early adoption permitted, although we do not plan to early adopt. This guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with retrospective application permitted. Since this amendment only requires additional disclosures, adoption of this ASU will not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn September 2025, the FASB issued amended guidance related to capitalization of internal-use software costs (ASU 2025-06). This amendment eliminates references to sequential software development stages and requires capitalization of internal-use software costs once management has authorized and committed to funding the software project and when the probability that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended is evident. This new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in our fiscal 2029 with early adoption permitted. This guidance will be applied using a prospective transition approach, with a modified retrospective or full retrospective transition approach permitted. Since the capitalization of internal-use software costs generally will not change significantly for most types of software under the amendments in this guidance, we do not expect adoption of this",
