Whether a manufacturing site is producing wafers, reticles, ICs or PCB products, our highly trained service teams collaborate with customers to determine the best products and services to meet technology and business requirements.\nOur backlog, primarily consisting of sales orders where written customer requests have been received, decreased from $9.83 billion as of June 30, 2024, to $7.86 billion as of June 30, 2025, as many of our capacity constrained suppliers made new investments to meet our growing needs, enabling us to deliver products more quickly than in the pandemic and early post-pandemic periods. Lead-time expectations, particularly from our largest customers, reverted to historical levels from the elevated lead times driven by the post-pandemic induced supply chain disruptions, and demands from a large number of new fabs in Asia normalized following multiple years of strong deliveries. We expect to recognize approximately 71% to 76% of this amount as revenue in the next 12 months, 20% to 25% in the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter, but this estimate is subject to constant change. The amount of backlog and timing of revenue recognition is driven by multiple variables, many of which are beyond our control, such as: changes in government regulations, the readiness of customer fabs, end market needs for capacity, changes in the estimated versus actual start time of customers’ projects, timing of delivery and installation dates and supply chain constraints. As customers try to balance the evolution of their technological, production or market needs with the timing and content of orders placed with us, there is increased risk of order modifications, pushouts or cancellations. Our backlog on any particular date does not provide meaningful information about the timing of future revenue recognition.\nManufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies\nWe perform system design, assembly and testing in-house and utilize an outsourcing strategy to manufacture components and major subassemblies. Our in-house manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies acquired from third-party vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products. Our principal manufacturing activities occur in the U.S., Singapore, Israel, Germany, U. K., Italy and China. Our supply chain strategy incorporates considerations for ethical labor practices, responsible minerals sourcing, and Responsible Business Alliance and SEMI guidelines, and there are increasing regulatory expectations on the environmental, social and/or geographic provenance of materials or components that may at times require us to incorporate further such considerations to our supply chain strategy.\nSome critical parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, “parts”) that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications, while other parts are standard commercial products. We use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials to manufacture and support our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, this is not always possible. Certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Through our business interruption planning, we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by, among other things, monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials, providing financial support and incentives to encourage vendors to increase capacity when required, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials, and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules.\nAlthough we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources, or disruptions within our suppliers’ often complex supply chains, could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers, damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe worldwide market for technologically advanced process control, process-enabling and yield management solutions used by semiconductor and electronics manufacturers is highly competitive, with important competitive factors including system performance, ease of use, reliability, technical service and support, and overall cost of ownership. However, we believe that, while the competitive factors listed are important, the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated capabilities into their existing development and manufacturing processes to enhance productivity, improve yields and reduce waste. To remain competitive, we use significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest significantly in product R&D. In each of our product markets, we have many competitors, including companies such as Applied Materials, Inc., ASML Holding N.V., Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Onto Innovation, Inc. and Lasertec, Inc., some of which may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved pricing and performance characteristics. We may also face future competition from new market entrants overseas or domestically. Our ability to compete in this area depends upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the U.S., and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region. We maintain our market position by building long-term relationships with our customers to meet their dynamic needs, as well as anticipating future market demands and enabling our customers to accelerate adoption and production of new technologies, as discussed further in the “Industry” section of this Item 1. Management believes that we are well positioned in the market with our industry-leading portfolio of products and services. However, any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share. Should this occur, it could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nPatents and Other Proprietary Rights\nWe protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of IP laws, including patent, copyright and trade secret. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the U.S. and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through IP laws. As of June 30, 2025, we owned over 8,500 active patents in the U.S. and other countries and had over 3,500 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Our patents have various terms expiring through 2044. In addition, from time to",
  "item7_clean": "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions and services for the semiconductor and related electronics industries. Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, support R&D and manufacturing of ICs, wafers and reticles. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical and nanometric level product defects, helping them to manage manufacturing process challenges and to obtain higher finish product yields at lower cost. We also offer advanced technology solutions to address various manufacturing needs of PCBs, specialty semiconductor devices and other electronic components, including advanced packaging, light emitting diode (“LED”), power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research. In addition, our services business has grown consistently each quarter on a year-over-year basis and accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenues in fiscal 2025, due to increases in the installed base of KLA systems. Our services revenue, which is generated largely from recurring “subscription-like” contracts, increases the value of our contract offerings and extension of system lifetimes resulting from growth in legacy semiconductor markets.\nOur semiconductor customers generally operate in one or both of the major semiconductor device manufacturing markets: memory and foundry/logic. End-market demand drivers that are expected to continue to benefit KLA in the long term include adoption of EUV in HVM for Logic and DRAM memory, which drives new process control requirements and growth in key markets for KLA. Demand for advanced semiconductor technologies, particularly evident in the 2-nanometer node, which is seeing higher levels of investment and process control intensity, continues to drive investments in AI. Increasing complexity and value of semiconductor packages, particularly for AI and HPC applications, is also driving significant growth in our advanced packaging business. The digitization of all industries, including 5G markets, advances in healthcare and industrial applications, together with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and intelligence in automobiles, are powering leading-edge design node technology investments and capacity expansions. While we continue to invest in technological innovation, factors such as delays from customers in adopting new chips and technology methods could impact process control capital intensity. Push out or cancellation of deliveries to our customers could still cause earnings volatility, due to the timing of revenue recognition as well as increased risk of inventory-related charges.\nWe are organized into three reportable segments, as follows:\nSemiconductor Process Control: a comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products as well as related service offerings that help IC manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the semiconductor fabrication process, from R&D to final volume production.\nSpecialty Semiconductor Process: advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers.\nPCB and Component Inspection: a range of inspection, testing and measurement, and direct imaging for patterning products used by manufacturers of PCBs, advanced packaging, MEMS and other electronic components.\nA majority of our revenues are derived from outside the U.S., and include geographic regions such as China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Europe and Israel, and Rest of Asia. China remains a major region for manufacturing of legacy node logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ICs. Additionally, a significant portion of global PCB manufacturing has migrated to China. Chinese government initiatives around self-sustainability are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting investment from semiconductor manufacturers from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the U.S. Although China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment sector, the U.S. government has tightened export controls for commodities, software, and technology (collectively, “items”) destined to China over the past several years. In the last few years, Commerce has adopted regulations and added certain China-based entities to the U.S. Entity List (a list of parties that are generally ineligible to receive U.S.-regulated items without prior licensing from Commerce), restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without an export license. In addition, Commerce has imposed export licensing requirements on China-based customers that are military end users or engaged in military end uses, as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to manufacture products connected to certain entities on the U.S. Entity List. The inability to obtain export licenses has resulted in a reduction to our backlog and required us to return some deposits received from customers in China for purchase orders, and limited our ability to meet our contractual obligations and sell our products or services to our customers in China. The percentage of our overall revenue from Chinese customers decreased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024. However increased investments in process control to meet leading-edge demand by our customers in Taiwan have contributed to our overall revenue increase in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024.\nThe recent imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government, along with countermeasures taken by foreign countries, have had an adverse impact on our results of operations, though the impact was not material in fiscal year 2025. There continues to be uncertainty around the ultimate duration, size and substance of the tariffs, including reciprocal actions against the U.S. by other\ncountries. However, despite headwinds from tariffs, our gross margin and overall financial performance improved in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 due to higher revenue volume on products and services sold and cost management.\nWe are continuously assessing the aggregate potential impact of government regulations and tariffs on our financial results and operations. See Part I Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this report for more information regarding how such actions by the U.S. government or another country could significantly impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers, especially in China, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years:\n\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except diluted net income per share)\nNet income attributable to KLA\nDiluted net income per share attributable to KLA\nWe continue to focus on returning cash to our investors, making $2.15 billion in share repurchases and paying $904.6 million in dividends in the year ended June 30, 2025. We increased the dividend in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 to $1.90 per share per quarter, which was our 16th consecutive annual dividend increase. Refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below for more information on our strong cash flow generation and strategy of returning excess cash to our stockholders.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nA critical accounting estimate is defined as one that has a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Where applicable, we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding critical accounting estimates. See Note 1 “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition.\nWe recognize revenue from sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the goods or services to the customer. The transaction price for our contracts with customers is allocated among the identified performance obligations and consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage.\nManagement uses judgment in identifying performance obligations, determining the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation and allocating consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations based on the SSP. We estimate the SSP of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a stand-alone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range. We typically have established SSP ranges for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions, entity-specific factors including discounting strategies, information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs. While changes in the allocation of SSP between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, management also uses judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and considers several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer, which could also impact the timing of revenue recognition, and could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. Although our products are generally not sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or sales incentives, which are accounted for either as variable consideration or a material right, depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement. These\ncredits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available.\nInventory Valuation.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand for meeting our product manufacturing plans and our customers’ support requirements. The estimate of net realizable value of inventory is impacted by assumptions regarding general semiconductor market conditions, manufacturing schedules, technology changes, new product introductions and possible alternative uses, and requires us to use significant judgment that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. If in any period we anticipate an adverse change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. The potential negative impact based on future demand is not practically quantifiable. On the other hand, if in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down in a previous period to a level below the ultimate realized selling price, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of revenues resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. A decrease in the future average selling prices would not have a material impact on the estimated net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could affect the likelihood that we will be required to recognize an impairment charge for goodwill include, but are not limited to, declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our market share and declines in revenues or profits at our reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference.\nWe determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach or market approach, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are judgmentally weighted. The income approach is estimated through discounted cash flow analysis. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is computed by adding the present value of the estimated annual discounted cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This valuation technique requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and other inputs. The estimated growth rates for the projection period are based on our internal forecasts of anticipated future performance of the business. The residual value is estimated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rates are calculated as the weighted average cost of capital of comparable peer companies, adjusted for company-specific risk. The market approach estimates the fair value of a reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method, which uses revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we noted a continued deterioration of the long-term forecast for our PCB business, which is part of our PCB and Component Inspection reportable segment. We also completed an internal reorganization affecting the composition of reporting units within our Specialty Semiconductor Process and PCB and Component Inspection reportable segments. These two events triggered goodwill and purchased intangible assets impairment tests, which resulted in a $230.4 million pre-reorganization goodwill impairment charge in the PCB and Component Inspection reportable segment. The quantitative assessment performed, which utilized a combination of the income and market approaches described above, was particularly sensitive to changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions. For example, if these estimates and assumptions were adjusted to the extent the fair valu",
