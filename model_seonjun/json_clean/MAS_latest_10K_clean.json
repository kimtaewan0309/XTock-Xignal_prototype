  "item1_clean": "Masco Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a global leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of branded home improvement and building products. Our portfolio of industry-leading brands includes BEHR® paint; DELTA® and HANSGROHE® faucets, bath and shower fixtures; LIBERTY® branded decorative and functional hardware; and HOT SPRING® spas. We leverage our powerful brands across product categories, sales channels and geographies to create value for our customers and shareholders.\nWe believe that our solid results of operations and financial position for 2024 resulted from our continued focus on our three strategic pillars:\ndrive the full potential of our core businesses;\nleverage opportunities across our enterprise; and\nactively manage our portfolio.\nIn 2024, we continued to return value to our shareholders by repurchasing approximately 10.0 million shares of our common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend by approximately two percent compared to 2023. In addition, in the third quarter of 2024, we completed the divestiture of our Kichler Lighting business.\nOur Business Segments\nWe report our financial results in two segments, our Plumbing Products segment and our Decorative Architectural Products segment, which are aggregated by product similarity. Our Decorative Architectural Products segment is impacted by seasonality and normally experiences stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters, corresponding with the peak season for repair and remodel activity.\nThe businesses in our Plumbing Products segment sell a wide variety of products that are manufactured or sourced by us.\nOur plumbing products include faucets, showerheads, handheld showers, valves, bath hardware and accessories, bathing units, shower bases and enclosures, shower drains, steam shower systems, water filtration systems, sinks and kitchen accessories. We primarily sell these products to home center retailers, online retailers, mass merchandisers, wholesalers and distributors that, in turn, sell them to plumbers, building contractors, remodelers, smaller retailers, consumers and homebuilders. The majority of our faucet, bathing and showering products are sold primarily in North America, Europe and China under the brand names DELTA\n, BRIZO\n, PEERLESS\n, HANSGROHE\n, AXOR\n, KRAUS\n, EASY DRAIN\n, NEWPORT BRASS\n, GINGER\n, BRASSTECH\n. Our BRISTAN™ and HERITAGE™ products are sold primarily in the United Kingdom.\nWe manufacture acrylic tubs, bath and shower enclosure units\nand shower bases and trays\nOur DELTA, PEERLESS and MIROLIN\nproducts are sold primarily to home center retailers in North America. Our MIROLIN products are also sold to wholesalers and distributors in Canada.\nOur spas, exercise pools, aquatic fitness systems and saunas are manufactured and sold under our HOT SPRING\n, CALDERA\n, FREEFLOW SPAS\n, FANTASY SPAS\n, AQUATERRA\n, LIFESMART\n, ENDLESS POOLS\n, TYLO\n, FINNLEO\nbrands, as well as under other trademarks. Our spas, exercise pools and saunas are sold worldwide to independent specialty retailers and distributors and our spas and saunas are also sold to online mass merchandisers. Certain exercise pools are also available on a consumer-direct basis in North America and Europe, while our aquatic fitness systems are sold through independent specialty retailers as well as on a consumer-direct basis in some areas.\nIncluded in our Plumbing Products segment are brass\ncopper and composite plumbing system components and other non-decorative plumbing products that are sold to plumbing, heating and hardware wholesalers, home center and online retailers, hardware stores, building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers. These products are marketed primarily in North America under our BRASSCRAFT\n, PLUMBSHOP\nbrands and are also sold under private label.\nWithin our Plumbing Products segment we develop connected water products that enhance the experience with water in homes and businesses. These systems include touchless activation, voice activation, controlled volume dispensing and provide for monitoring and controlling the temperature and flow of water and are compatible with a range of faucets, showerheads and other showering components.\nWe also supply high-quality, custom thermoplastic solutions, extruded plastic profiles and specialized fabrications, as well as PEX tubing, to manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers for use in diverse applications that include faucets and plumbing supplies, appliances, oil and gas equipment and building products.\nWe believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in North America and Europe. Competitors of the majority of our products in this segment include Dornbracht AG & Co. KG, Zurn Elkay Water Solutions Corporation, Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.'s Moen, Rohl and Riobel brands, Kohler Co., Lixil Group Corporation’s American Standard and Grohe brands, Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.'s Pfister faucets as well as private label and digitally native brands. Competitors of our spas, exercise pools, aquatic fitness systems and saunas include Artesian Spas, Harvia, Jacuzzi and Master Spas brands, among others. Foreign manufacturers competing with us are located primarily in Europe, China and Canada. Additionally, we face significant competition from private label products and digitally native brands. The businesses in our Plumbing Products segment manufacture products primarily in North America and Europe as well as in Asia and source products from Asia and other regions. Competition for our plumbing products is based largely on brand reputation, product features and innovation, product quality, customer service, breadth of product offering and price. Many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured by low-cost foreign manufacturers that contribute to price competition.\nMany of our plumbing products contain brass, the major components of which are copper and zinc. We have multiple sources, both domestic and foreign, for our raw materials used in this segment. We have encountered price volatility for brass, brass components and any components containing copper and zinc. To help reduce the impact of this volatility, from time to time we may enter into long-term agreements with certain significant suppliers. In addition, some of the products in this segment that we import have been and may in the future be subject to duties and tariffs.\nDecorative Architectural Products\nOur Decorative Architectural Products segment primarily includes architectural coatings, including paints, primers, specialty coatings, stains and waterproofing products, as well as paint applicators and accessories. These products are sold primarily in North America as well as in South America under the brand names BEHR\n, KILZ\n, WHIZZ\n\nand other trademarks to “do‑it‑yourself” and professional customers through home center retailers and other retailers. Net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 32 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2024, 2023, and 2022. Our BEHR products are sold through The Home Depot, our largest customer overall, as well as this segment’s largest customer. Our Behr business grants Behr brand exclusivity in the retail sales channel in North America to The Home Depot. The granting of exclusivity affects our ability to sell those products and brands to other customers, and the loss of this segment’s sales to The Home Depot would have a material adverse effect on this segment’s business and on our consolidated business as a whole.\nOur competitors in this segment include large national and international brands such as Benjamin Moore & Co., Pittsburgh Paints Co.'s Glidden, Olympic, Pittsburgh Paints and Stains and PPG Paints brands, RPM International, Inc.'s Rust-Oleum and Zinsser brands, The Sherwin‑Williams Company's Minwax, Sherwin-Williams, Thompson’s Water Seal, Valspar and Purdy brands and the Wooster Brush Company, as well as many regional and other national brands. We believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer selection, and that competition in this industry is also based largely on product features and innovation, product quality, customer service, breadth of product offering and price.\nAcrylic resins and titanium dioxide are principal raw materials in the manufacture of architectural coatings. The price of acrylic resins fluctuates based on the price of its components, which can have a material impact on our costs and results of operations in this segment. The price for titanium dioxide can fluctuate as a result of global supply and demand dynamics and production capacity limitations, which can have a material impact on our costs and results of operations in this segment. In addition, the prices of crude oil, natural gas, propylene and certain petroleum by-products can impact our costs and results of operations in this segment. We have multiple sources, both domestic and foreign, for the raw materials used in this segment and have encountered price volatility with respect to certain of these materials. To help reduce the impact of this price volatility, we have and may in the future enter into long-term agreements with certain significant suppliers. We import certain materials and products for this segment that have been and may in the future be subject to duties and tariffs. We also have agreements with certain significant suppliers for this segment that are intended to help assure continued supply.\nOur Decorative Architectural Products segment includes branded cabinet and door hardware, functional hardware, wall plates, hook and hook rail products, and outdoor living hardware, which are manufactured for us and sold to home center retailers, mass retailers, online retailers, other specialty retailers, original equipment manufacturers and wholesalers. These products are sold under the LIBERTY\n, BRAINERD\n, FRANKLIN BRASS\nand other trademarks. Our key competitors in North America include Amerock Hardware, Richelieu Hardware Ltd., Top Knobs and private label brands. Decorative bath hardware, shower accessories, mirrors and shower doors are sold under the brand names DELTA\nand other trademarks to home center retailers, mass retailers, online retailers, other specialty retailers and wholesalers. Competitors for these products include American Bath Group, LLC's Dreamline brand, Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.'s Moen brand, Gatco Fine Bathware, Kohler Co. and private label brands.\nAdditional Information\nIntellectual Property\nWe hold numerous U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications, licenses, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing processes. We view our trademarks and other intellectual property rights as important, but do not believe that there is any reasonable likelihood of a loss of such rights that would have a material adverse effect on our present business as a whole.\nLaws and Regulations Affecting Our Business\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and international government laws and regulations. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that impact our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe monitor applicable laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, and incur ongoing expense relating to compliance, however we do not expect that compliance with federal, state, local and international regulations will result in material capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nHuman Capital Management\nThe performance of our Company is impacted by our human capital management, and as a result we are focused on attracting, developing and retaining highly qualified, engaged employees, who have diverse experiences and backgrounds. We have developed three strategic talent priorities: leadership, diversity, equity and inclusion, and future workforce. Our Chief Human Resources Officer is responsible for devel",
  "item7_clean": "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, our consolidated financial statements (and notes related thereto) and other more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report. Further, you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. See also “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Report. Amounts may not add due to rounding.\nWe design, manufacture and distribute branded home improvement and building products. These products are sold primarily for repair and remodeling activity and, to a lesser extent, new home construction. We sell our products through home center retailers, online retailers, wholesalers and distributors, mass merchandisers, hardware stores, direct to the consumer, professional contractors and homebuilders.\nWe continue to pursue our strategy of driving the full potential of our core businesses, leveraging opportunities across our enterprise, and actively managing our portfolio. We remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and long-term strategy. We execute our strategy by investing in our brands, developing innovative products, making capital investments, and focusing on continuous productivity improvement and operational excellence, among other initiatives. We believe that our strong financial position and cash flow generation, together with our investments in our industry-leading branded building products, our continued focus on innovation and disciplined capital allocation, will allow us to drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.\nWe continue to leverage the Masco Operating System, our methodology to drive growth and productivity, and continuous improvement initiatives across our enterprise to identify additional opportunities to improve our business operations. From time to time, we may take actions to drive efficiency in the business focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses, including business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions and other cost savings initiatives.\nDue to changing market conditions, we are experiencing, and may continue to experience, lower market demand for our products. We also have been experiencing, and may continue to experience, elevated commodity and other input costs, as well as employee-related cost inflation. We aim to offset the potential unfavorable impact of our elevated costs and lower demand for our products with productivity improvements, pricing, and other initiatives.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). However, we believe that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. These include the disclosure of net sales, operating profit and operating profit margins adjusted for certain items. Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results under GAAP.\nNET SALES\nBelow is a summary of our net sales, in millions, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of a percent of net sales\nImpairment charge for other intangible assets\nOperating profit, as reported\nRationalization charges\nImpairment charge for other intangible assets\nInsurance settlement\nOperating profit, excluding rationalization charges, impairment charge, and insurance settlement\nOperating profit margin, as reported\nOperating profit margin, excluding rationalization charges, impairment charge, and insurance settlement\nOur gross profit for 2024 was $2,831 million, which remained flat compared to 2023. Gross profit was negatively impacted by one percent due to the non-recurrence of the receipt of an insurance settlement payment in 2023, as well as unfavorable sales mix, and one percent each due to lower sales volume and unfavorable foreign currency translation. These amounts were mostly offset by cost savings initiatives and one percent due to higher net selling prices.\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for 2024 were $1,468 million, which remained flat compared to 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses were positively impacted by one percent each due to the divestiture of Kichler in the third quarter of 2024 and lower sales commissions, mostly offset by two percent due to higher employee-related costs.\nOur operating profit for 2024 was $1,363 million, which increased one percent, and was positively impacted by the non-recurrence of an impairment charge for other intangible assets in 2023.\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\nBelow is a summary of our other income (expense), net, in millions, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n(A)\n(A)\nCurrently payable income taxes\nPurchase commitments\n(B)\nUncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties\n(C)\n______________________________\n(A)\nWe assume that all debt would be held to maturity. Amounts include finance lease obligations.\n(B)\nIncludes purchase commitments for vendor contracts and contracts for the purchase of renewable energy credits and transferable tax credits. Excludes contracts that do not require volume commitments and open or pending purchase orders.\n(C)\nDue to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate for the year in which cash settlements may occur with applicable tax authorities.\nRefer to Note M to the consolidated financial statements for defined-benefit pension plan obligations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect or could have affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly review our estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities and related disclosures, and future revenues and expenses, that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nNote A to the consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies, estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe recognize revenue as control of our products is transferred to our customers, which is generally at the time of shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual terms with our customers. We provide customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. These customer programs and incentives are considered variable consideration. We include in revenue variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the variable consideration is resolved. This determination is made based upon known customer program and incentive offerings at the time of sale, and expected sales volume forecasts as it relates to our volume-based incentives. This determination is updated each reporting period.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe record the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. We selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by market participants. We have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level.\nDetermining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. Our judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes. In estimating future cash flows, we rely on internally generated five-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, and, currently, a two percent long-term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five-year forecast. We generally develop these forecasts based upon, among other things, recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated repair and remodel activity and, to a lesser extent, estimated housing starts. Our assumptions included U.S. and Eurozone Gross Domestic Product growing at approximately 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, in 2025, and 2.0 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, per annum over the remainder of the five-year forecast.\nWe utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 8.50 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows. In 2024, based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses, we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 10.50 percent to 12.50 percent for our reporting units.\nIf the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit's recorded carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values. Accordingly, we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill. A 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment.\nWe review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit. Potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of an other indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying value. We utilize a relief-from-royalty model to estimate the fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near- and long-term. We also consider the profitability of the business, among other factors, to determine the royalty rate for use in the impairment assessment.\nWe utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 8.50 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows. In 2024, based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses and the nature of the other indefinite-lived intangible assets (i.e., trade name), we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 11.50 percent to 13.50 percent for our other indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nIf the carrying amount of an other indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that an other indefinite-lived intangible asset's recorded carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the other indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we estimated that the future discounted cash flows projected for all of our other indefinite-lived intangible assets were greater than the carrying values. Accordingly, we did not recognize any impairment charges for other indefinite-lived intangible assets. A 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our other indefinite-lived intangible assets would have resulted in a $1 million impairment of one of our other indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nRefer to Note H for additional information.\nWe record deferred taxes on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of our assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on sufficient sources of taxable income in future periods. Possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains and projected future taxable income.\nIf, based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to evidence that is objectively verifiable such as cumulative losses in recent years, however, some evidence may be based on estimates and assumptions regarding potential sources of future taxable income. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may result in a change in judgment regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets.\nRefer to Note P for additional information.\nRecently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note A to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nDecorative Architectural Products\nGeneral corporate expense, net\nTotal operating profit\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS DISCUSSION\nChanges in operating profit in the following Business Segment Results discussion exclude general corporate expense, net, and compares each respective period to the same period of the immediately preceding year.\nNet sales in the Plumbing Products segment were flat in 2024. In local currencies (including sales in currencies outside their respective functional currencies), net sales increased one percent in 2024. Higher net selling prices increased sales by two percent and the acquisition of Sauna360 Group Oy (\"Sauna360\") in 2023 increased sales by one percent. These increases were mostly offset by lower sales volume and unfavorable sales mix which each d",
