MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-looking statements\nThe terms “us,” “we,” “our” or “Pentair” refer to Pentair plc and its consolidated subsidiaries. At Pentair, we believe the health of our world depends on reliable access to clean water. We deliver a comprehensive range of smart, sustainable water solutions to homes, businesses and industries around the world. Our industry-leading and proven portfolio of solutions enables our customers to access clean, safe water; reduce water consumption; and recover and reuse water. Whether it’s moving, improving or helping people enjoy water, we help manage life’s most essential resource. We are comprised of three reportable segments: Flow, Water Solutions and Pool. For the first nine months of 2025, the Flow, Water Solutions and Pool reportable segments represented approximately 37%, 26% and 37% of total consolidated net sales, respectively. We classify our operations into reportable segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets served:\n— The focus of this segment is to deliver water where it is needed, when it is needed, more efficiently and to transform waste into value. This segment designs, manufactures and sells a variety of fluid treatment and pump products and systems, including pressure vessels, gas recovery solutions, membrane bioreactors, wastewater reuse systems and advanced membrane filtration, separation systems, specialty insertion valves, line stop fittings and installation equipment, water disposal pumps, water supply pumps, fluid transfer pumps, turbine pumps, solid handling pumps and agricultural spray nozzles, while serving the global residential, commercial and industrial markets. These products and systems are used in a range of applications, including fluid delivery, ion exchange, desalination, food and beverage, separation technologies for the oil and gas industry, residential and municipal wells, water treatment, wastewater solids handling, pressure boosting, circulation and transfer, fire suppression, flood control, agricultural irrigation and crop spray.\n— The focus of this segment is to provide great-tasting, higher-quality water and ice while helping people use water more productively. This segment designs, manufactures and sells commercial and residential water treatment products and systems including pressure tanks, control valves, activated carbon products, commercial ice machines, conventional filtration products, and point-of-entry and point-of-use water treatment systems. These water treatment products and systems are used in residential whole home water filtration, drinking water filtration and water softening solutions in addition to commercial total water management and filtration in foodservice operations.\n— The focus of this segment is to provide innovative, energy-efficient pool solutions to help people more sustainably enjoy water. This segment designs, manufactures and sells a complete line of energy-efficient residential and commercial pool equipment and accessories including pumps, filters, heaters, lights, automatic controls, automatic cleaners, maintenance equipment and pool accessories. Applications for our pool products include residential and commercial pool maintenance, pool repair, renovation, service, construction and aquaculture solutions.\nOn September 17, 2025, as part of our Flow reportable segment, we completed the acquisition of Hydra-Stop, LLC (“Hydra-Stop”) for $292.2 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and subject to customary adjustments. Hydra-Stop manufactures specialty insertion valves, line stop fittings and installation equipment.\nOn December 2, 2024, as part of our Pool reportable segment, we completed the acquisition of G & F Manufacturing, LLC (“G & F Manufacturing”) for $116.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired and subject to customary adjustments. The net purchase price is comprised of an upfront cash payment of $108.0 million, subject to customary adjustments, and the estimated fair value at the acquisition date of a contingent earn-out liability based upon the achievement of certain defined operating results in the two years following the acquisition. G & F Manufacturing manufactures and services pool heat pumps.\nKey trends and uncertainties regarding our existing business\nThe following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in the first nine months of 2025 and are reasonably likely to impact our results in the future:\nWe have a Transformation Program designed to accelerate growth and drive margin expansion by driving operational excellence, reducing complexity and streamlining our processes. During 2024 and the first nine months of 2025, we made strategic progress on our Transformation Program initiatives with a focus on our four key themes of pricing excellence, sourcing excellence, operations excellence and organizational effectiveness. We expect to continue to execute on our key Transformation Program initiatives to drive margin expansion and to continue to incur transformation costs throughout the remainder of 2025 and beyond.\nDuring 2024 and the first nine months of 2025, we implemented 80/20 guiding principles to enable our Transformation Program. This 80/20 analysis is expected to create value by focusing on key customers and products through quadrant-based strategies. We expect the analysis to result in actions to improve operating performance by driving growth with our highest value customers, reducing lower margin sales and removing complexity in the future.\nDuring 2024 and the first nine months of 2025, we executed certain business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business. We expect these actions to continue throughout the remainder of 2025 and to drive margin growth.\nDuring 2024 and the first nine months of 2025, we experienced inflationary cost increases for certain raw materials as well as logistics and transportation costs. The ongoing volatile market for commodities has the potential to continue to drive price increases in our supply chain. In addition, the current U.S. administration has implemented tariffs and has announced the possibility of implementing additional, or increasing current, tariffs. We expect these actions and reactionary tariff adjustments by other countries to continue to impact our business and contribute to inflationary cost increases. As a result, we have taken actions to mitigate the impact of tariffs such as pricing increases, inventory pre-buys and supply chain optimization actions, which may continue going forward. In addition, our Transformation Program initiatives are intended to improve productivity and offset cost increases. We anticipate supply chain pressures as well as inflationary cost increases due to these tariffs and any resulting impact on macroeconomic conditions and our business to continue throughout the remainder of 2025.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”) for a global 15.0% minimum tax have been adopted by a number of jurisdictions in which we operate. Pillar Two has negatively impacted our effective tax rate in 2025 and is likely to continue to impact our effective tax rate in the future. We continue to evaluate the enacted legislative changes and new guidance as it becomes available.\nWe have identified specific product and geographic market opportunities that we find attractive and continue to pursue, both within and outside the U.S. We expect to continue investing in our businesses to drive these opportunities through research and development and additional sales and marketing resources. Unless we successfully penetrate these markets, our core sales growth will likely be limited or may decline.\nIn 2025, our operating objectives focus on delivering our core and building our future. We expect to execute these objectives by:\nDelivering profitable revenue growth and productivity for customers and shareholders;\nContinuing to focus on capital allocation through:\nCommitting to maintain our investment grade rating;\nFocusing on reducing our long-term debt;\nReturning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and\nAccelerating our performance with strategically aligned mergers and acquisitions;\nFocusing growth initiatives that accelerate our investments in digital, innovation, technology and sustainability;\nContinuing to implement our Transformation Program initiatives that will drive operational excellence, reduce complexity and improve our organizational structure, which includes the focus on 80/20 actions to drive profitable growth; and\nBuilding a high-performance growth culture and delivering on our commitments while living our Win Right values.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe consolidated results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were as follows:\n\nThree months ended September 30, 2025\nNine months ended September 30, 2025\nover the prior year period\nover the prior year period\nVolume/Price/Acquisition/Divestiture\nThe 1.2 percentage point decrease in segment income for Pool as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of 2025 from 2024 was primarily driven by:\ninflationary cost increases, including higher tariffs, certain raw materials and labor costs; and\ndecreased productivity due to investments in growth initiatives.\nThis decrease was partially offset by:\nincreased selling prices to mitigate impacts of inflation.\nThe 0.9 percentage point increase in segment income for Pool as a percentage of net sales in the first nine months of 2025 from 2024 was primarily driven by:\nincreased selling prices to mitigate impacts of inflation.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\ninflationary cost increases, including higher tariffs, certain raw materials and labor costs.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe generally fund cash requirements for working capital, capit"
