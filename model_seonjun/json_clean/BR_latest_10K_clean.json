We offer electronic and traditional hard copy services for the delivery of proxy materials to investors and collection of consents; maintenance of a rules engine and database that contains the delivery method preferences of our clients’ customers; posting of documents on their websites; email notification to investors alerting them that proxy materials are available; and proxy voting via telephone, online, mobile, or paper. We have the ability to combine shareholder communications for multiple stockholders residing at the same address. We also offer proxy vote solicitation services for the registered clients of fund companies, efficiently managing the entire proxy campaign.\nIn addition, we provide a complete outsourced solution for the processing of all international institutional and retail proxies, including shareholder disclosure management.\nA majority of publicly-traded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners. Instead, a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name, meaning that they are held of record by broker-dealers or banks through their depositories. Most street name shares are registered in the name “Cede & Co.” the name used by The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTC”), which holds shares on behalf of its participant broker-dealers and banks. These participant broker-dealers and banks (which are known as “Nominees” because they hold securities in name only) in turn hold the shares on behalf of their customers, the individual beneficial owners. Nominees, upon request, are required to provide companies with the information of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names, addresses, and shareholdings supplied to companies, so called “non-objecting beneficial owners” (or “NOBOs”). Objecting beneficial owners (or “OBOs”) may be contacted directly only by the broker-dealer or bank. As DTC’s role is only as the custodian, a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights DTC holds as the record owner (such as the right to vote) to the beneficial owners. The first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy,” which DTC executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant Nominees. Under applicable rules, Nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions.\nGiven the large number of Nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders, we play a unique, central, and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue for Nominees, companies, funds, and investors. A large number of Nominees have contracted out the processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us. Nominees accomplish this by entering into agreements with Broadridge and transferring to us, via powers of attorney, the authority to execute a proxy, which authority the Nominee receives from DTC via an omnibus proxy. Through our agreements with Nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services, we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of Nominees receive proxy materials on a timely basis digitally or in print, that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies and funds conducting solicitations and that these services are fulfilled in accordance with the requirements of their particular solicitation. In order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively, we interface and coordinate directly with each company and/or fund to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and timely manner. As it would increase the costs for companies and funds to work with the Nominees through which their shares are held beneficially on an individual basis, companies and funds work with us for the performance of the tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed on a timely basis to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported.\nThe SEC’s rules require public companies to reimburse Nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name. The reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), including the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). We bill public companies for the proxy services performed, collect the fees, and remit to the Nominee its portion of the fees. In addition, the NYSE rules establish fees for certain services provided by intermediaries, such as Broadridge, in the proxy process. The preparation and delivery of NOBO information is subject to reimbursement by the corporate issuers requesting the information. The reimbursement rates are based on the number of NOBOs produced pursuant to NYSE or other SRO rules. The rules also determine the fees to be paid to third-party intermediaries, such as Broadridge, who compile the NOBO information on behalf of Nominees who need to respond to corporate issuer requests for NOBO information.\nWe provide institutional investors with a suite of services to manage and track the entire proxy voting process, including meeting their reporting needs. ProxyEdge\n(“ProxyEdge”) is our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors and financial advisors that integrates ballots for positions held across multiple custodians and presents them under a single proxy. Voting can be instructed for the entire position, by account vote group, or on an individual account basis either manually or automatically based on the recommendations of participating governance research providers. ProxyEdge also provides for client reporting and regulatory reporting. ProxyEdge can be utilized for meetings of U.S. and Canadian companies and for meetings in many non-North American countries based on the holdings of our global custodian clients. ProxyEdge is offered in several languages and there are currently over 7,000 ProxyEdge users worldwide.\nIn addition to our proxy services, we provide regulatory communications solutions that enable global asset managers to communicate with large audiences of investors efficiently and reliably by centralizing all investor communications through one resource. We provide composition, printing, filing, and distribution services for regulatory reports, prospectuses, and proxy materials, as well as mutual fund proxy solicitation services. We manage the entire communications process with both registered and beneficial stockholders and provide a complete platform for creating and distributing regulatory investor communications acro",
  "item7_clean": "Recurring revenue growth constant currency (Non-GAAP) was 8%, driven by 4pts of organic growth and 4pts from the acquisition of SIS.\nBy product line, Recurring revenue growth and Recurring revenue growth constant currency (Non-GAAP) were as follows:\nCapital markets rose 6% and 6%, respectively, driven by revenue from new sales and Internal Growth. Internal Growth benefited from higher trading volumes.\nWealth and investment management rose 10% and 12%, respectively, driven by 10pts from the SIS acquisition and 1pt of Organic growth. Organic growth was negatively impacted by 4pts as a result of the loss of a large client during the prior year period.\nEarnings before income taxes increased $28.0 million, as higher revenues more than offset higher expenses, including the impact of the SIS acquisition.\nPre-tax margins increased by 0.8 percentage points to 11.3% from 10.5%.\nLoss before income taxes was $196.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, a decrease of $49.7 million, or 20%, compared to $246.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The decreased loss before income taxes was due to lower Restructuring and Other Related Costs, a decline in litigation expense of $18.4 million, and a decline in Interest expense, net of $15.4 million.\nExplanation and Reconciliation of the Company’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company believes our Non-GAAP financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company’s business performance. Management believes that Non-GAAP measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company’s Compensation Committee of the Board incorporates Non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.\nAdjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share\nThese Non-GAAP measures reflect Operating income, Operating income margin, Net earnings, and Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items, the exclusion of which management believes provides insight regarding our ongoing operating performance. Depending on the period presented, these adjusted measures exclude the impact of certain of the following items:\n(i) Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, which represent non-cash amortization expenses associated with the Company’s acquisition activities.\n(ii) Acquisition and Integration Costs, which represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisition activities.\n(iii) Restructuring and Other Related Costs, which represent costs associated with the Company’s Corporate Restructuring Initiative to exit and/or realign some of our businesses, streamline the Company’s management structure, reallocate work to lower cost locations, and reduce headcount in deprioritized areas, in addition to other restructuring activities. Refer to Note 13, “Payables and Accrued Expenses” for further details on the Company’s Corporate Restructuring Initiative.\n(iv) Litigation Settlement Charges, which represent reserves established during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2024 related to the settlement of claims. Refer to Note 19, “Contractual Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for further details.\nWe exclude Acquisition and Integration Costs, Restructuring and Other Related Costs and Litigation Settlement Charges from our Adjusted Operating income (as applicable) and other adjusted earnings measures\nbecause excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and enhances comparability across fiscal reporting periods, as these items are not reflective of our underlying operations or performance.\nWe also exclude the impact of Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, as these non-cash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the Company's capital allocation decisions, management compensation metrics or multi-year objectives. Furthermore, management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Although we exclude Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property from our adjusted earnings measures, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.\nIn addition to the Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, we provide Free cash flow information because we consider Free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures as well as Software purchases and capitalized internal use software.\nRecurring Revenue Growth Constant Currency\nAs a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The exclusion of the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations from our Recurring revenue growth, or what we refer to as amounts expressed “on a constant currency basis,” is a Non-GAAP measure. We believe that excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations from our Recurring revenue growth provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods.\nChanges in Recurring revenue growth expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the comparative year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year.\nReconciliation of such Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures (unaudited)\n\nDistribution revenues increased $63.0 million, or 3%, driven by the postage rate increase of approximately\n$114 million partially offset by lower mail volumes\nTotal operating expenses.\nOperating expenses increased $210.9 million, or 4%, to $5,700.6 million from $5,489.7 million:\nCost of revenues - The increase of $179.5 million primarily reflects higher expenses related to the SIS acquisition, the impact of higher postage and distribution costs in our ICS segment of approximately $58 million, and higher expenses related to higher revenues.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses - The increase of $31.4 million was primarily driven by higher technology-related investments.\nInterest expense, net.\nInterest expense, net, was $122.7 million, a decrease of $15.4 million, or 11%, from $138.1 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings rates.\nOther non-operating expenses, net.\nOther non-operating expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was $7.1 million, compared to $1.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nProvision for income taxes\nEffective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 - 20.7%.\nEffective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 - 20.4%.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income and lower tax benefits from statutory tax incentives, which was partially offset by an increase in discrete tax benefits.\nANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nBroadridge has two reportable segments: (1) Investor Communication Solutions and (2) Global Technology and Operations.\nThe primary components of “Corporate and Other” are certain gains, losses, centrally managed activities, and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense.\nCertain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in Corporate and Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.\n\nSIS is included in the Company’s GTO reportable segment. Our discussions with the Canadian Competition Bureau are ongoing. In July 2024, the Company acquired CompSci, a provider of cloud-based financial technology software for the preparation and processing of SEC filings for public companies and funds. CompSci is included in the Company’s ICS reportable segment. We acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $193.5 million.\nAnnounced Acquisition\nIn July 2025, Broadridge announced the proposed acquisition of Acolin Group Holdco Limited (“Acolin”). Acolin is a European provider of cross-border fund distribution and regulatory services. The total purchase price is approximately $70 million plus an additional contingent consideration liability. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of Broadridge’s 2026 fiscal year, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Acolin will be included in the Company’s ICS reportable segment.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nIn presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management. In management’s opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods.\nProcessing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business. We process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. The recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies. This has caused our revenues, operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. The seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.\nWe review the carrying value of all our Goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. When determining fair value of a reporting unit, we utilize the income approach which considers a discounted future cash flow analysis using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit’s weighted-average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows based on forecasted earnings before interest and taxes, and the selection of the terminal value growth rate and discount rate assumptions. The weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the total amount of Goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We had $3,609.6 million of Goodwill as of June 30, 2025. Given the significance of our Goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings.\nThe Company performs a sensitivity analysis under the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. A 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our Goodwill.\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). The Company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $48.7 million as of June 30, 2025 of which $6.9 million are subject to expiration in the June 30, 2035 through ",
