BUSINESS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\nNiSource Inc. is an energy holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 whose primary subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies, serving approximately 3.8 million customers in six states. NiSource is the successor to an Indiana corporation organized in 1987 under the name of NIPSCO Industries, Inc., which changed its name to NiSource Inc. on April 14, 1999.\nNiSource’s principal subsidiaries include NiSource Gas Distribution Group, Inc. (a holding company that owns Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Maryland, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia of Virginia), and NIPSCO Holdings I (a holding company that owns a controlling interest in NIPSCO, a gas and electric utility). NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of these rate-regulated businesses.\nOur business strategy focuses on providing safe and reliable service through our core, rate-regulated, asset-based utilities, with the goal of adding value to all of our stakeholders. Our utilities continue to advance our core safety, infrastructure and environmental investment programs, supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across the six states in which we operate. Our goal is to develop strategies that (i) support long-term infrastructure investment and safety programs to better serve our customers, (ii) align our tariff structures with our cost structure, and (iii) drive value and enable growth in an evolving energy ecosystem. These strategies focus on improving safety and reliability, enhancing customer experience, pursuing regulatory and legislative initiatives to increase accessibility for customers currently not on our gas and electric service, ensuring customer affordability and reducing emissions while generating sustainable returns.\nWe remain committed to the advancement of our SMS for the safety of our customers, communities and employees. Our SMS is the established operating model within NiSource. NiSource continues to maintain its certification to the American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice 1173, which serves as the guiding practice for our SMS. In 2024, NiSource was recognized with the ISO 55001 certification from LRQA, one of the world’s leading providers of professional engineering and technology services. Achieving this international certification for asset management systems recognizes NiSource’s commitment to safety for our people, systems and customers. These certifications are important milestones for our SMS and NiSource’s ongoing journey towards operational excellence.\nNiSource has two reportable segments: Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations. The remainder of our operations, which are not significant enough on a stand-alone basis to warrant treatment as an operating segment, consist of our centralized corporate activities and are primarily comprised of interest expense on holding company debt and unallocated corporate costs and activities. The following is a summary of the business for each reporting segment. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 21, \"Business Segment Information,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to each segment.\nColumbia Operations provides natural gas to approximately 2.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, and Maryland. We operate approximately 37,200 miles of distribution main pipeline plus the associated individual customer service lines and 330 miles of transmission main pipeline located in our service areas described above. Throughout our service areas we also have gate stations and other operations support facilities. See below for information on our owned operating facilities. There were no significant disruptions to our system or facilities during 2024.\nStorage Capacity (MCF)\nBlackhawk Underground Storage\nPortsmouth Propane-Air\nNiSource has entered into an agreement to sell this facility, subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\nDue to open access and the deregulation of natural gas supplies, our LDC customers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers in an open, competitive market. Certain of our subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide our residential and commercial customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use our subsidiaries for transportation services. As of December 31, 2024, 33.9% of our residential customers and 41.2% of our commercial customers participated in such programs.\nWe compete with (i) investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout our service areas, (ii) other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and (iii) other alternate fuels, such as propane and fuel oil. We continue to be a well-positioned competitor in the energy markets in which we operate due to customer preference for natural gas.\nAdditionally, we are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. Revenues from our gas distribution operations are more significant during the heating season, which is from October through May. Please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results and Discussion of Operations - Columbia Operations,\" for additional information.\nNIPSCO Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 0.9 million customers in northern Indiana. We operate approximately 17,900 miles of distribution main pipeline plus the associated individual customer service lines and 690 miles of transmission main pipeline located in our northern Indiana service areas. Throughout northern Indiana, we also have gate stations and other operations support facilities. See below for information on our owned operating facilities. There were no significant disruptions to our system or facilities during 2024.\nStorage Capacity (MCF)\nRoyal Center Underground Storage\nLiquified Natural Gas\nSimilar to the Columbia Operations segment, NIPSCO Gas also operates in an open and competitive market which allows retail customers to purchase gas directly from producers and marketers. As of December 31, 2024, 6.7% of our residential customers and 17.6% of our commercial customers participated in such programs.\nWe compete with (i) investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout our northern Indiana service area, (ii) other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and (iii) other alternate fuels, such as propane and fuel oil.\nAdditionally, we are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales.

BUSINESS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\nWe generate, transmit and distribute electricity to approximately 0.5 million customers in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana and also engage in wholesale electric and transmission transactions. Our transmission system, has voltages from 69,000 to 765,000 volts, and consists of approximately 3,000 circuit miles. We are interconnected with eight neighboring electric utilities. We operate 66 transmission and 250 distribution substations, and own approximately 311,300 poles. We own and operate generation assets as well as source power through PPAs. We continue to transition our generation portfolio from coal-fired generation to lower-emission sources. We currently have six owned renewable generation facilities in service: Rosewater, Indiana Crossroads Wind, Indiana Crossroads Solar, Dunns Bridge I Solar, Cavalry Solar and Storage and Dunns Bridge II Solar and Storage. Cavalry Solar and Storage went into service May 2024 and Dunns Bridge II Solar and Storage went into service in January 2025. As of December 31, 2024, we have multiple PPAs that provide 600 MW of capacity, with contracts expiring between 2038 and 2040. We also operate two hydro electric generation facilities, a CCGT, and two coal generation facilities. The R.M. Schahfer coal facility is scheduled to be retired by the end of 2025 and the Michigan City coal facility is scheduled to be retired by the end of 2028. Our generating facilities had no material unplanned interruptions during 2024.

Dunns Bridge has installed battery storage capacity of 56MW over a four-hour duration.\nNIPSCO's 2024 Integrated Resource Plan (\"2024 Plan\") was submitted to the IURC in December 2024. The 2024 Plan informs future generation investments required to ensure reliability for NIPSCO's customers and incorporated factors such as anticipated load growth from data centers and other economic development opportunities, new EPA emissions rules, and evolving MISO resource accreditation rules. The 2024 Plan maintains the retirement decisions and capacity additions identified in the 2018 and 2021 Integrated Resource Plans and calls for additional generation resources through 2029 to support capacity requirements. In addition, if significant new data center load is contracted, the 2024 Plan calls for additional gas-fired resources to support that additional capacity. Refer to Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion of these plans.\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\nNIPSCO participates in the MISO transmission service and wholesale energy market. MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC regulations to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Additionally, MISO is responsible for managing energy markets, transmission constraints and the day-ahead, real-time, Financial Transmission Rights and ancillary markets. NIPSCO has transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO, and transmission service for NIPSCO occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff. NIPSCO generating units are dispatched by MISO which takes into account economics, reliability of the MISO system and unit availability. During the year ended December 31, 2024, NIPSCO generating units, inclusive of its owned renewable generation facilities, were dispatched to meet 55.4% of its overall system load, and the remainder of the overall system load was procured through PPAs and the MISO market.\nOur NIPSCO Electric utility generally has exclusive service areas under Indiana regulations and retail electric customers in Indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier. NIPSCO faces non-utility competition from other energy sources, such as self-generation by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources.\nOur NIPSCO Operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales.

As of December 31, 2024, a collateral requirement of approximately $115.5 million would be required in the event of a downgrade below investment grade. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 770,000,000 shares, $0.01 par value, of which 750,000,000 are common stock and 20,000,000 are preferred stock. As of December 31, 2024, 469,822,472 shares of common stock were outstanding. For more information regarding our common and preferred stock, see Note 6, \"Equity,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations, Cash Requirements and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. Our material cash requirements are detailed below. We intend to use funds from the liquidity sources referenced above to meet these cash requirements.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had\nin long-term debt, of which\nin short-term borrowings outstanding.\nDuring 2025 and 2026, we expect to make cash payments of $685.5 million and $631.2 million,\nrespectively, related to pipeline service obligations including demand for gas transportation, gas storage and gas purchases, and\n$140.5 million and $24.9 million\n, respectively, for long lead time items related to plant equipment purchases.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\nOur expected payments include employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2025. Plan contributions beyond 2025 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated at this time. In 2025, we expect to make contributions of approximatel\ny $2.3 million to our pension plans and approximately $21.3 million to our postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to\nNote 16, \"Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nWe cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to certain of our long-term obligations classified as \"Total Other Liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe have uncertain income tax positions for which we are unable to predict when the matters will be resolved. Refer to Note 15, \"Income Taxes,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nNIPSCO has executed several PPAs to purchase 100% of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per MWh. NIPSCO has also executed several BTAs with developers to construct renewable generation facilities. See Note 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies - A. Contractual Obligations,\" and\nNote 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies - E. Other Matters,\"\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn addition, we, along with certain of our subsidiaries, enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.\nRefer to Note 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual obligations over the next 5 years and thereafter and our off-balance sheet arrangements.\nMarket Risk Disclosures\nRisk is an inherent part of our businesses. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability. We seek to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. We manage risk through a multi-faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. Our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. These may include, but are not limited to market, operational, financial, compliance and strategic risk types. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, our risk management process, policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.\nCommodity Price Risk\nOur gas and electric subsidiaries have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, our subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps, forwards and options. We do not participate in speculative energy trading activity.\nCommodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rate-regulated subsidiaries is limited and does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk, since our current regulatory mechanisms allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. These changes are included in the GCA and FAC regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms. If these mechanisms were to be adjusted or eliminated, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. For additional information, see \"Results and Discussion of Operations\" in this Management's Discussion.\nOur subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, some of which are reflected in our restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.\nRefer to Note 13, \"Risk Management Activities,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program, and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $7.9 million and $18.9 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. We are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future long-term debt issuances. From time to time, we may enter into forward interest rate instruments to lock in long term interest costs and/ or rates.\nDue to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities. Our extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Management Policy which establishes guidelines for documenting management approval levels for credit limits, evaluating creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function, which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative-related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit.\nThe financial status of our banking partners is periodically assessed through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe apply certain accounting policies in accordance with GAAP, which require that we make estimates and judgments that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on our operations and Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements:\nBasis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.\nRegulated Operations\n, provides that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be billed and collected. Accordingly, certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income may be deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. For additional information, refer to Note 12, \"Regulatory Matters,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future, all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980,\nRegulated Operations\n. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under GAAP for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980,\nRegulated Operations\n, we would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980-20,\nDiscontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting\n. In management’s opinion, our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980,\nRegulated Operations\nfor the foreseeable future.\nCertain of the regulatory assets reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, we believe that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. If we determine that the amounts included as regulatory assets are no longer probable of recovery, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\nOne of the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance is the regulatory overlay for JV accounting. The application of HLBV to consolidated VIEs generally results in the recognition of profit from the related JVs over a time frame that is different from when the regulatory return is earned. In accordance with the principles of ASC 980, we have recognized a regulatory deferral of certain amounts representing the timing difference between the profit earned from the JVs and the amount included in regulated rates to recover our approved investments in consolidated JVs. For additional information, refer to Note 1, \"Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - S. Noncontrolling Interest,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits.\nWe have defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care trend rates, and mortality rates, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into AOCI or a regulatory balance sheet account, depending on the jurisdiction of our entity. These deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets (known in GAAP as the “corridor” method) or when settlement accounting is triggered.\nThe discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. Methods used to develop these assumptions are described below. While a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions, we are ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions.\nThe discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. Our discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an AA-rated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is a compo",
