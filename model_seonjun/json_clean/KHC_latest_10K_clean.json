  "item1_clean": "*Used under license.\nWe sell certain products under brands we license from third parties. In 2024, brands used under licenses from third parties included\npackaged drink pouches for sale in our North America segment. We also grant certain licenses to third parties to use our intellectual property rights in select jurisdictions. In our agreements with an affiliate of Groupe Lactalis (“Lactalis”), we granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in perpetuity, including perpetual licenses for the\nbrands for certain cheese products.\nWe also own numerous patents worldwide. We consider our portfolio of patents, patent applications, patent licenses under patents owned by third parties, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations. Patents, issued or applied for, cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country.\nRaw Materials and Packaging:\nWe manufacture (and contract for the manufacture of) our products from a wide variety of raw materials. We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, tomato products, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils, coffee beans, wheat and processed grains, eggs, and other fruits and vegetables to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of plastics, cardboard, resin, glass, and metal to package our products, and we use electricity, diesel fuel, and natural gas in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. For commodities that we use across many of our product categories we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale. In addition, some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations. We source these commodities from a variety of providers, ranging from large, international producers to smaller, local, independent sellers. Where appropriate, we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities. The prices of raw materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors, such as global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate change, pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, consumer, industrial, or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative energy, and agricultural programs. In 2024, we experienced moderate inflation in our supply chain costs compared to the prior year period, which we expect to continue through 2025. While inflationary pressures within procurement, manufacturing, and logistics costs had a negative impact on our results of operations, we experienced increased stability of these costs as compared to the prior year period.\nOur procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices. Although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. We actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measures.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development efforts focus on achieving the following four objectives:\nproduct innovations, renovations, and new technologies to meet changing consumer needs, support our environmental and sustainability goals, and drive growth;\nworld-class and uncompromising food safety, quality, and consistency;\nsuperior, consumer-preferred product and package performance; and\ncontinuous process, product, and supply chain optimization and productivity initiatives.\nOur products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces, including e-commerce retailers, large-format retailers, and discounters. Our competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies. We compete with both branded and private label products sold by retailers, wholesalers, and cooperatives. We compete on the basis of product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service, taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences. Improving our market position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising, promotional, and research and development expenditures.\nSales and Customers:\nOur products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers, agents, and distributors to chain, wholesale, cooperative, and independent grocery accounts; convenience, value, and club stores; pharmacies and drug stores; mass merchants; foodservice distributors; and institutions, including hotels, restaurants, bakeries, hospitals, health care facilities, and government agencies. Our products are also sold online through various e-commerce platforms and retailers.\nWe have key customers in different regions around the world. In 2024, the five largest customers in our North America segment accounted for approximately 46% of North America segment net sales, the five largest customers in our International Developed Markets segment accounted for approximately 28% of International Developed Markets net sales, and the five largest customers in Emerging Markets accounted for approximately 12% of Emerging Markets net sales. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 21% of our net sales in 2024, 2023, and 2022. Both of our reportable segments have sales to Walmart Inc.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, we changed the way we manage our product portfolio to align with our future growth strategy. As of December 28, 2024, we manage our sales portfolio through eight consumer-driven product platforms. A platform is a lens created for the portfolio based on a grouping of consumer needs and includes the following for Kraft Heinz: Taste Elevation, Easy Ready Meals, Substantial Snacking, Desserts, Hydration, Cheese, Coffee and Meats.\nTaste Elevation includes condiments, sauces, dressings, and spreads. Easy Ready Meals includes Kraft Mac & Cheese varieties, frozen potato products, and other frozen meals. Substantial Snacking includes Lunchables meal kits, frozen snacks, and pickles. Desserts includes dry packaged desserts, refrigerated ready to eat desserts, and other dessert toppings. Hydration includes ready to drink beverages, powdered beverages, and liquid concentrates. Cheese includes American sliced and recipe cheeses. Coffee includes mainstream coffee, coffee pods, and premium coffee. Meats includes cold cuts, bacon, and hot dogs.\nThe platforms are modular and configurable by reportable segment and market and help us to manage and organize our business effectively by providing insight into our various product categories and brands. Further, each platform is assigned a role within our business to help inform our resource allocation and investment decisions, which are made at the operating segment level. These roles include Accelerate, Protect, and Balance. The role of a platform may also vary by reportable segment and market.\nNet Sales by Platform:\nNet sales by platform as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the periods presented were:\nACCELERATE\nSubstantial Snacking\nPROTECT\nBALANCE\nAlthough crops constituting certain of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis, the majority of our products are produced throughout the year.\nSeasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products, including holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. While these factors influence our quarterly net sales, operating income/(loss), and cash flows at the product level, unless the timing of such events shift period-over-period (e.g., a shift in Easter timing), this seasonality does not typically have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or segment results.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated. Our business operations, including the production, transportation, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, quality, and safety of our products and their ingredients, and our occupational safety, health, and privacy practices, are subject to various laws and regulations. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also subject to numerous laws and regulations outside of the United States in markets where our products are manufactured, distributed, or sold, including laws and regulations governing food safety, health and safety, anti-corruption, and data privacy. In our business dealings, we are also required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, and various other anti-corruption regulations in the regions in which we operate. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, regulatory regime changes may add cost and complexity to our compliance efforts.\nEnvironmental Regulation:\nOur activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight regarding environmental matters. Various laws concerning the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations.\nIn the United States, where a significant portion of our business operates, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party. We are involved in a number of active proceedings in the United States under CERCLA (and other state actions under similar legislation) related to certain closed, inactive, or divested operations for which we retain liability.\nAs of December 28, 2024, we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of ",
  "item7_clean": "Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022:\nDiluted EPS increased 20.9% to $2.31 in 2023 compared to $1.91 in 2022, primarily driven by the net income/(loss) factors discussed above.\nRestructuring activities\nUnrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges\nCertain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters\nLosses/(gains) on sale of business\nOther losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures\nNonmonetary currency devaluation\nDebt prepayment and extinguishment (benefit)/costs\nCertain significant discrete income tax items\nKey drivers of change in Adjusted EPS\nResults of operations\nOther expense/(income)\n(a) Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nsection at the end of this item.\nAdjusted EPS increased 7.2% to $2.98 in 2023 compared to $2.78 in 2022, primarily driven by higher Adjusted Operating Income and lower interest expense, which more than offset the decrease from lapping a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period, unfavorable changes in other expense/(income), and higher taxes on adjusted earnings.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nWe manage our operating results through four operating segments. We have two reportable segments defined by geographic region: North America and International Developed Markets. Our remaining operating segments, consisting of WEEM and AEM, are combined and disclosed as Emerging Markets.\nManagement evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales, Organic Net Sales, and Segment Adjusted Operating Income. In the first quarter of 2024, certain measures utilized by management to evaluate segment performance changed, including a change from Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Segment Adjusted Operating Income in order to drive a stronger connection to our long-term strategic plan. Segment Adjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income/(loss) excluding, when they occur, the impacts of restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results), impairment losses, and certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters. Segment Adjusted Operating Income for Emerging Markets, which represents the aggregation of our WEEM and AEM operating segments, is defined and presented consistently with the Segment Adjusted Operating Income of our reportable segments — North America and International Developed Markets. Segment Adjusted Operating Income is a financial measure that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management also uses Segment Adjusted Operating Income to allocate resources. We have reflected this change from Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Segment Adjusted Operating Income in all historical periods presented.\nUnder highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in other expense/(income) on our consolidated statement of income, as nonmonetary currency devaluation, rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on our consolidated balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. See Note 2,\nSignificant Accounting Policies,\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, for additional information. We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our subsidiaries in Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey, Egypt, and Nigeria, which are all in Emerging Markets.\nInternational Developed Markets\n2024 Compared to 2023\n2023 Compared to 2022\nInternational Developed Markets\nTotal Organic Net Sales\n(a) Organic Net Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nsection at the end of this item.\nDrivers of the changes in net sales and Organic Net Sales were:\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n2024 Compared to 2023\nInternational Developed Markets\n2023 Compared to 2022\nInternational Developed Markets\nAdjusted Operating Income:\n\nYear 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year\nNet sales increased 5.4% to $2.9 billion in 2023 compared to $2.7 billion in 2022, including the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency (6.6 pp), lapping a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period (1.7 pp), and acquisitions and divestitures (0.2 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 13.9% to $3.0 billion in 2023 compared to $2.6 billion in 2022, driven by higher pricing (10.9 pp) and favorable volume/mix (3.0 pp). Higher pricing included increases across markets primarily to mitigate higher input costs. Volume/mix was favorable in our Eastern European countries and LATAM region, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in our Asia region.\nSegment Adjusted Operating Income increased 17.6% to $376 million in 2023 compared to $319 million in 2022, primarily driven by higher pricing and favorable volume/mix, partially offset by higher supply chain costs, reflecting inflationary pressure in LATAM and Eastern Europe regions; increased SG&A due, in part, to investments in advertising and research and development; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (14.1 pp); increased depreciation expense; and the decrease from lapping a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period (2.7 pp).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that cash generated from our operating activities, commercial paper programs, and Senior Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, repayments of long-term debt, future contractual obligations, payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends, planned capital expenditures, restructuring expenditures, and contributions to our postemployment benefit plans for the next 12 months. An additional potential source of liquidity is access to capital markets. We intend to use our cash on hand and commercial paper programs for daily funding requirements.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures:\nIn the first quarter of 2024, we consummated the Russia Infant Transaction for total cash consideration of approximately $25 million, and the Papua New Guinea Transaction for total cash consideration of approximately $22 million, which is to be paid incrementally over two years following the transaction closing date.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we sold our business-to-business powdered cheese business to a third party, Kerry Group, for cash consideration of approximately $108 million (the “Powdered Cheese Transaction”).\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we acquired a majority of the outstanding equity interests of Companhia Hemmer Indústria e Comércio (“Hemmer”), a Brazilian food and beverage manufacturing company focused on the condiments and sauces category, from certain third-party shareholders (the “Hemmer Acquisition”) for cash consideration of approximately $279 million.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we acquired 85% of the shares of Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”), a German-based company focused on direct-to-consumer sales of premium spice blends, from certain third-party shareholders (the “Just Spices Acquisition”) for cash consideration of approximately $243 million. In the third quarter of 2023, we completed the redemption of an additional 5% of the outstanding shares and in the second quarter of 2024, we completed the redemption of the remaining outstanding shares and wholly own Just Spices as of December 28, 2024.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, for additional information on our acquisitions and divestitures.\nCash Flow Activity for 2024 Compared to 2023:\nNet Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.2 billion for the year ended December 28, 2024 compared to $4.0 billion for the year ended December 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to lapping the prior year cash payments associated with the settlement of the consolidated securities class action lawsuit and the current year conversion of certain plan assets related to the U.S. postretirement medical plan to cash, which were partially offset by higher cash outflows for variable compensation in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period and increased cash taxes. See Note 15,\nCommitments and Contingencies\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, for additional information on our legal proceedings and See Note 11,\nPostemployment Benefits\n, in Item 8 for more additional information on our postemployment benefit plans activities.\nNet Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities:\nNet cash used for investing activities was $1.0 billion for the year ended December 28, 2024 compared to net cash used for investing activities of $916 million for the year ended December 30, 2023. This change was primarily driven by our payments to acquire the TGI Friday License and increased capital expenditures. This was offset by proceeds from net investment hedge settlements. Our 2024 capital expenditures were primarily driven by maintenance projects, capital investments focused on generating growth, including capacity expansion, digital projects, and cost improvement projects, as well as capital investments in technology. We expect 2025 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.0 billion.\nNet Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities:\nNet cash used for financing activities was $3.0 billion for the year ended December 28, 2024 compared to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 30, 2023. This change was primarily due to increased common stock repurchases pursuant to our publicly announced share repurchase program, partially offset by reduced debt repayments in the current year period compared to the prior year.\nCash Flow Activity for 2023 Compared to 2022:\nNet Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.0 billion for the year ended December 30, 2023 compared to $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by lower cash outflows in the current year for inventories, primarily related to stock rebuilding in the prior year, lower cash outflows in the current year for cash tax payments driven by cash taxes paid in 2022 related to the Cheese Transaction, higher Adjusted Operating Income in 2023, and lower interest payments in the current period due to the reduction of long-term debt throughout 2022. These impacts were partially offset by cash payments associated with the settlement of the consolidated securities class action lawsuit. See Note 15,\nCommitments and Contingencies\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, for additional information on our legal proceedings.\nNet Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities:\nNet cash used for investing activities was $916 million for the year ended December 30, 2023 compared to net cash used for investing activities of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. This change was primarily driven by payments for the Just Spices Acquisition and Hemmer Acquisition in 2022, partially offset by higher proceeds from the settlement of net investment hedges in the prior year period, proceeds from the Powdered Cheese Transaction in 2022, and higher capital expenditures in the current year period. We had 2023 capital expenditures of $1.0 billion compared to 2022 capital expenditures of $916 million.\nNet Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities:\nNet cash used for financing activities was $2.7 billion for the year ended December 30, 2023 compared to $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. This change was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of 600 million euro aggregate principal amount floating rate senior notes in 2023 and lower repayments of long-term debt in the current year period, partially offset by increased common stock repurchases primarily driven by our share repurchase program.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, for additional information on our debt transactions and Note 18,\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, for additional information on our share repurchase program.\nCash Held by International Subsidiaries:\nOf the $1.3 billion cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2024, $781 million was held by international subsidiaries.\nSubsequent to January 1, 2018, we consider the unremitted earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be indefinitely reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed, if repatriated, related to our 2018 through 2024 accumulated earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately $80 million. Our undistributed historical earnings in foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2017 are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Our deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed historical earnings was insignificant at December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, and relates to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed.\nTrade Payables Programs:\nIn order to manage our cash flow and related liquidity, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which\ninclude the extension of payment terms. We maintain agreements with third-party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, at the sole discretion of the supplier, sell one or more of those payment obligations to participating financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. Our current payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 0 to 250 days. All amounts due to participating suppliers are paid to the third party on the original invoice due dates, regardless of whether a particular invoice was sold. The amounts outstanding under these programs were $745 million at December 28, 2024 and $819 million at December 30, 2023. The amounts were included in trade payables on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 14,\nFinancing Arrangements\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, for additional information on our trade payables programs.\nBorrowing Arrangements:\nFrom time to time, we obtain funding through our commercial paper programs. We had no commercial paper outstanding at December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. We had no commercial paper outstanding during the year ended December 28, 2024, and the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding was $150 million during the year ended December 30, 2023 and $198 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn July 2022, together with KHFC, our 100% owned operating subsidiary, we entered into a new credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $4.0 billion (the “Senior Credit Facility”) and replaced our then-existing credit facility (the “Previous Senior Credit Facility”). On September 27, 2024, we entered into an agreement to extend the maturity date of our Senior Credit Facility from July 8, 2028 to July 8, 2029. Subject to certain conditions, we may increase the amount of revolving commitments and/or add tranches of term loans i",
