It has been used consistently by Globe Life's management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nNet operating income as an ROE, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"), is considered a non-GAAP measure. Management utilizes this measure to view the business without the effect of changes in AOCI, which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates. The impact of the adjustment to exclude AOCI is $(2.0) billion and $(2.5) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nBook value per share, excluding AOCI, is also considered a non-GAAP measure. Management utilizes this measure to view the book value of the business without the effect of changes in AOCI, which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates. The impact of the adjustment to exclude AOCI is $(24.11) and $(29.27) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nAnalysis of Profitability by Segment\nfor non-GAAP reconciliation to GAAP.\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nSummary of Operations.\nNet income totaled $895 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with $816 million in the same period in 2024.\nOn a diluted per common share basis, net income per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased 21% from $8.93 to $10.77.\nNet operating income was $925 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with $843 million for the same period in 2024.\nOn a diluted per common share basis, net operating income per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased from $9.23 to $11.13, a 21% increase.\nNet operating income is primarily comprised of insurance underwriting margin plus excess investment income and annuity and other income, offset by operating expenses, after tax and, as such, is considered a non-GAAP measure. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments. Additionally, net income was affected by certain non-operating items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. We remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non-operating items when evaluating the results of current operations, and therefore exclude such items from our segment analysis for current periods.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the Company performed its annual assumptions review and updated both its life and health assumptions of lapses, mortality, and morbidity resulting in a $134.3 million net remeasurement gain as compared to a $46.3 million net remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of assumption changes, the Company's results for actual variances from expected experience for both life and health produced a $24.0 million net remeasurement gain and a $14.7 million net remeasurement gain for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. During nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company's results for actual variances from expected experience for both life and health produced a $53.6 million net remeasurement gain and a $38.4 million net remeasurement gain, respectively.\nAs previously noted, a component of insurance underwriting margin is policy obligations, which includes for each reporting period the change in the liability for future policy benefits (\"LFPB\"). The LFPB is determined each reporting period based on the net level premium method. Net level premiums reflect a recomputed net premium ratio using actual experience since the issue date, and expected future experience based on future cash-flow assumptions See\nNote 6—Policy Liabilities\nfor additional information.\nOverall, the Company continues to see positive signs in its core operations, including sales and premium growth, and continues to achieve an operating ROE (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income) generally in the mid-teens.\nGLOBE LIFE INC.\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nGlobe Life's operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth below. Net operating income has been used consistently by management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from GAAP net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized gains and losses and other significant and unusual items included in net income. Management believes an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company’s business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nAnalysis of Profitability by Segment\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nLife insurance underwriting margin\nHealth insurance underwriting margin\nExcess investment income\nSegment profit or (loss)\nAnnuity and other income\nAdministrative expense\nOther corporate expense\nNet operating income\n\nManagement's Discussion & Analysis\nA discussion of life operations by distribution channel follows.\nAmerican Income Life Division\nis an exclusive agency that markets to members of labor unions and other affinity groups and continues to diversify its lead sources, utilizing internally generated leads, third-party internet vendor leads and referrals to facilitate sustainable growth. This Division is Globe Life's largest contributor of life premium of any distribution channel at 53% of the Company's September 30, 2025 total life premium. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the average monthly life premium issued per policy was $59 as compared to $56 for the same period in the prior year. Net sales were $291 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, up from $289 million in the year-ago period. The underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 50% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 47% for the same period in the prior year.\nThe average producing agent count increased 3% over the year-ago period. The increase in average producing agent count was driven by an increase in new agent recruiting along with continued improvement in new agent retention. Sales growth in this Division, as well as within our other exclusive agencies, is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force.\nBelow is the average producing agent count as of the indicated periods for the American Income Life Division. The average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the beginning and end of each week during the year.\nAmerican Income Life continues to focus on growing and strengthening the agency force, specifically through emphasis on agency middle-management growth and additional agency openings. In addition to offering financial incentives and training opportunities, the Division has made considerable investments in information technology, including a customer relationship management (CRM) tool for the agency force. This tool is designed to provide dashboards and drive productivity in lead distribution, conservation of business, and new agent recruiting. Additionally, this Division has invested in and successfully implemented technology that allows the agency force to engage in virtual recruiting, training, and sales activity. The agents have shifted to primarily a virtual experience with the customers and have generated a vast majority of sales through virtual presentations. We find this flexibility to be enticing for new recruits as well as a driver of retention in our agency force.\nDirect to Consumer Division\n(DTC) markets adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of channels, including direct mail, insert media, and digital marketing. The different media channels support and complement one another in the Division's efforts to provide consumer outreach. All three channels work as part of an omnichannel approach. Sales from the internet and inbound phone calls continue to outpace the activity from direct mail. DTC's long-term growth has been fueled by consistent innovation and brand awareness. Additionally, the DTC Division provides valuable support to our agency business through brand impressions and inquiries that lead to sales in our exclusive agency channels. We have implemented new technology to enhance our underwriting process, this has improved the conversion of customer inquiries into sales. New initiatives are continuously introduced to help increase response rates, issue rates, and create a seamless customer experience. The juvenile insurance market is an important source of sales as well as a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of existing juvenile insureds, who are more likely to respond favorably to a direct to consumer solicitation for life coverage on themselves in comparison to the general adult population. Additionally, future offerings to parents and grandparents for adult and juvenile insurance are sources of lower acquisition-cost life insurance sales in the future.\nDTC net sales were flat at $83 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the year-ago period. We have seen net sales trending up the last two quarters and noted a 13% increase for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year three months ended. We have bee"
