  "item1_clean": "The Procter & Gamble Company (the Company) is a world-leading multinational consumer goods company focused on providing trusted, branded products of superior quality, performance and value to improve the lives of consumers around the world - now and for generations to come. Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories throughout the world. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having first been established as a New Jersey corporation in 1890, and was built from a business founded in Cincinnati in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble.\nFinancial Information about Segments\nInformation about our reportable segments can be found in the MD&A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNarrative Description of Business\n. Our business model is focused on delivering sustainable value creation by driving balanced top- and bottom-line growth. We create, manufacture, market and distribute a diversified portfolio of daily-use products to delight consumers with irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. We invest in research and development and consumer insights to invent new categories or products and innovate our existing products, ensuring they meet evolving consumer needs and preferences. We leverage marketing strategies including advertising, promotions and endorsements to drive brand awareness and loyalty among consumers. The Company utilizes various distribution channels, including retail stores, e-commerce platforms and direct-to-consumer platforms to deliver our products. Our business model relies on continued productivity improvements to fuel investments in research and development and marketing and deliver value creation. Our objective is to deliver sustainable and balanced top- and bottom-line growth while serving the needs of all stakeholders — consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners.\nKey Product Categories\n. Information on key product categories can be found in the MD&A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n. Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. Sales to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 16% of our total sales in 2025 and 2024 and 15% in 2023. No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 43% of our total net sales in 2025, 42% in 2024 and 40% in 2023.\nSources and Availability of Materials\n. Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing processes and in the transportation of input materials and finished products. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation including new or increased tariffs. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which are material to our business taken as a whole.\nTrademarks and Patents\n. We own or have rights to patents and trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Our patents cover a range of product features, including significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks and patents.\nCompetitive Condition\n. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products from a broad range of companies, both large and small, both established and new, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. In this highly competitive setting, we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. Our integrated strategy and our focus on driving superiority across product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value are key differentiators in the marketplace.\n2 The Procter & Gamble Company\nGovernment Regulation\n. Our Company is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business. In the United States, many of our products and manufacturing operations are subject to one or more federal or state regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and antitrust and competition laws and regulations that govern our dealings with suppliers, customers, competitors and government officials.\nIn addition, many foreign jurisdictions in which we do business have regulations and regulatory bodies that govern similar aspects of our operations and products, in some cases to an even more significant degree. We are also subject to expanding laws and regulations related to environmental protection and other sustainability-related matters, non-financial reporting and diligence, labor and employment, trade, taxation and privacy and data protection, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and similar regulations in states within the United States and in countries around the world.\nThe Company has in place compliance programs and internal and external experts to help guide our business in complying with these and other existing laws and regulations that apply to us around the globe; and we have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with these laws and regulations. We also expect that our many suppliers, consultants and other third parties working on our behalf share our commitment to compliance, and we have policies and procedures in place to manage these relationships, though they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over operations and governance. We do not expect that the Company’s expenditures for compliance with current government regulations, including current environmental regulations, will have a material effect on our total capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in fiscal year 2026 as compared to prior periods.\n. Our employees are a key source of competitive advantage. Their actions, guided by our Purpose, Values and Principles (PVPs), are critical to the long-term success of our business. We aim to retain our talented employees by offering competitive compensation and benefits, strong career development and a respectful and inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for all.\nOur Board of Directors, through the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (C&LD Committee), provides oversight of the Company’s policies and strategy relating to talent, including equality and inclusion, as well as the Company’s compensation principles and practices. The C&LD Committee also evaluates and approves the Company’s compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior executives.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had approximately 109,000 employees, an increase of 2% versus the prior year due to business growth. The total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops, contractors and employees of joint ventures. 49% of our employees are in manufacturing roles and 28% of our employees are located in the United States. 42% of our global employees are women and 32% of our U.S. employees identify as multicultural.\nTraining and Development\nWe focus on attracting, developing and retaining the broadest pool of talent available, both from universities and the broader market. We recruit from universities across markets in which we compete and are generally able to select from the top talent. We focus on developing our employees by providing a variety of job experiences, training programs and skill development opportunities. Given our develop-from-within model for staffing most of our senior leadership positions, it is particularly important for us to ensure holistic growth and full engagement of our employees.\nEquality and Inclusion\nAs a global consumer products company, P&G serves consumers around the world with operations in approximately 70 countries. We believe that it is good for business that our workforce is drawn from the best available talent from communities worldwide, with insights about, connectivity to and understanding of all our consumers. Further, a foundational component of P&G's strategy and success has been to foster an inclusive work environment, in which we develop and advance the very best capabilities that all our people have to offer. Globally, we aspire to reflect the diversity of the consumers we serve in the communities where we operate and are committed to creating a superior employee experience for all. Our aspiration is founded on our longstanding values and principles for equal opportunity and compliance with the law.\nCompensation and Benefits\nMarket-competitive compensation and reward programs are critical elements of our employee value equation to attract and retain the best talent. Our total rewards programs are based on the principles of paying for performance, paying competitively versus peer companies that we compete with for talent in the marketplace and focusing on long-term success through a combination of short-term and long-term incentive programs. We also offer competitive benefit programs, including retirement plans and health insurance, in line with local country practices, with flexibility to accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce.\n. Environmental sustainability is integrated into our business strategy. We are focused on designing and manufacturing irresistibly superior products that are more sustainable. We aim to reduce our own environmental footprint and\nThe Procter & Gamble Company 3\nenable our consumers to reduce their footprint without compromising on the performance of the products they use. We develop and license technologies that can be used across industries to improve environmental sustainability at a broader scale.\nCombined, this approach intends to positively impact the total environmental impact of the Company while driving market growth and value creation.\nIn 2021, the Company announced a 2040 net zero ambition. Our Climate Transition Action Plan outlines the Company’s ongoing efforts toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions across scopes 1 and 2 and elements of scope 3. The Company has also declared ambitions towards purchasing renewable electricity for our operations, reducing intensity of virgin petroleum-based plastic in packaging, designing more consumer packaging to be recyclable or reusable, responsible sourcing of key forest-based commodities, improving efficiency of water usage in our operations and driving a global portfolio of water restoration projects in key water basins. While we have met or exceeded some of the goals and are making significant progress against others, scalable infrastructure and cost-effective solutions are not yet available to us to fully delive",
  "item7_clean": "Net sales increased $245 million to $84.3 billion versus the prior year. Net sales increased low single digits in Health Care and was unchanged in Grooming, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Net Sales declined low single digits in Beauty. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 2%. Organic sales increased low single digits in all Sector Business Units.\nThe Procter & Gamble Company 19\nOperating income increased $1.9 billion, or 10%, to $20.5 billion due to a reduction in selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A) in the current year and the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset in the prior year.\nNet earnings increased $1.1 billion, or 7%, to $16.1 billion due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by higher restructuring charges in the current year, which includes $801 million after tax related to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina.\nNet earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.1 billion, or 7%, to $16.0 billion.\nDiluted EPS increased 8% to $6.51 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes incremental restructuring charges and the prior year Gillette intangible asset charge, increased 4% to $6.83.\nCash flow from operating activities was $17.8 billion.\n◦ Adjusted free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the 2017 U.S. Tax Act, was $14.6 billion.\n◦ Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings excluding the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina, was 87%.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nGlobal Economic Conditions.\nOur products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised approximately 21% of our net sales in fiscal 2025. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to various risks due to economic, political and social instabilities, market volatility, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, new or increased tariffs, foreign exchange and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for 1% of consolidated net sales, net earnings and net assets as of June 30, 2025.\nWe have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, which have negatively impacted net sales, net earnings and cash flows. In response to the devaluation of foreign currencies (including those deemed highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nCommodities and Supply Chain.\nOur costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution operations can lead to increased costs. Legal or regulatory requirements and sustainability initiatives may result in increased costs. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may negatively impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nGovernment Policies.\nWe are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy”. Government controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, SG&A, operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-\n20 The Procter & Gamble Company\nstore and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.\nOur cost of products sold and SG&A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in SG&A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased advertising), inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.\nFor a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2024 year-over-year changes, please refer to the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's\nNet sales increased $245 million to $84.3 billion in fiscal 2025 as an increase in net sales driven by pricing of 1% was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 1%. Volume and mix were unchanged versus the prior year.\nNet sales increased low single digits in Health Care and was unchanged in Grooming, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Net sales decreased low single digits in Beauty. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 2%. Organic sales increased low single digits in all Sector Business Units.\nComparisons as a percentage of net sales; fiscal years ended June 30\n\nGross margin decreased 20 basis points to 51.2% of net sales. The decrease in gross margin was due to:\n110 basis points of decline from unfavorable product mix,\n50 basis points of product and packaging investments,\n30 basis points of higher commodity costs,\n20 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,\n10 basis points of higher transportation costs and other costs and\n10 basis points of higher costs from tariffs.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n180 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings and\n30 basis points of increase due to higher pricing.\nTotal SG&A decreased 3% to $22.7 billion and SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points to 26.9% due to decreased marketing spending and higher foreign exchange transactional charges in the prior year period.\nMarketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points due to a decrease in marketing spending and productivity savings.\nOverhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points as wage inflation headwinds were more than offset by productivity savings, which includes adjustments to variable compensation payouts.\nOther operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points driven by favorable foreign exchange impacts.\nProductivity-driven cost savings delivered 140 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.\nThe Procter & Gamble Company 21\nOperating income increased $1.9 billion, or 10%, to $20.5 billion and operating margin increased 220 basis points to 24.3% due primarily to the decrease in SG&A and the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset in the prior year. For further discussion of the Gillette impairment charge, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense was $907 million, a decrease of $18 million versus the prior year.\nInterest income was $469 million, a decrease of $4 million versus the prior year.\nOther non-operating income, net decreased $514 million to $154 million primarily driven by the higher non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina in the current year compared to the same charge due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Nigeria in the prior year.\nThe effective income tax rate for fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, was 20.3%, compared to 20.2% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina, partially offset by favorable geographic mix impacts.\nEarnings before income taxes increased $1.4 billion, or 7%, to $20.2 billion as the increase in operating income, the components of which are discussed above, were partially offset by the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina. Net earnings increased $1.1 billion, or 7%, to $16.1 billion due to the increase in earnings before income taxes, partially offset by the effective income tax rate increase discussed above.\nForeign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $45 million due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.\nNet earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.1 billion, or 7%, to $16.0 billion.\nDiluted EPS increased $0.49, or 8%, to $6.51 due primarily to the increase in net earnings.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs which are reported in Corporate and are included as part of the Corporate discussion. Additionally, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our consolidated effective tax rate are included in Corporate. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on items included in Corporate.\n\nRepresents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the 2017 U.S. Tax Act.\nRepresents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2028 are not currently determinable.\nPrimarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nThe Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer",
