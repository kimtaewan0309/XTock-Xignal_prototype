  "item1_clean": "OVERVIEW\nWe were founded in 1919 as Cummins Engine Company, a corporation in Columbus, Indiana, and one of the first diesel engine manufacturers. In 2001, we changed our name to Cummins Inc. We are a global power solutions leader comprised of five business segments - Engine, Components, Distribution, Power Systems and Accelera - supported by our global manufacturing and extensive service and support network, skilled workforce and vast technical expertise. Our products range from advanced diesel, natural gas, electric and hybrid powertrains and powertrain-related components including aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, valvetrain technologies, controls systems, air handling systems, automated transmissions, axles, drivelines, brakes, suspension systems, electric power generation systems, electrified power systems with innovative components and subsystems, including battery, fuel cell and electric power technologies and hydrogen production technologies. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, dealers and other customers worldwide. We serve our customers through a service network of approximately 650 wholly-owned, joint venture and independent distributor locations and more than 19,000 Cummins certified dealer locations in approximately 190 countries and territories.\nDivestiture of Atmus\nOn March 18, 2024, we completed the divestiture of our remaining 80.5 percent ownership of Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc. (Atmus) common stock through a tax-free split-off. The exchange resulted in a reduction of shares of our common stock outstanding by 5.6 million shares and a gain of approximately $1.3 billion. See NOTE 21, \"ATMUS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) AND DIVESTITURE,\" to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor additional information.\nSettlement Agreements\nIn December 2023, we announced that we reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the Environmental and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the California Attorney General’s Office to resolve certain regulatory civil claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process for certain engines primarily used in pick-up truck applications in the U.S., which became final and effective in April 2024 (collectively, the Settlement Agreements). In the second quarter of 2024, we made $1.9 billion of payments required by the Settlement Agreements. See NOTE 14, “COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES,” to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor additional information.\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nWe have five complementary operating segments: Engine, Components, Distribution, Power Systems and Accelera. These segments share technology, customers, strategic partners, brand recognition and our distribution network in order to compete more efficiently and effectively in their respective markets. In each of our operating segments, we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, price, total cost of ownership, fuel economy, emissions compliance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support.\nWe use segment earnings or losses before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and noncontrolling interests (EBITDA) as the basis for the Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable operating segments. We believe EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors. See NOTE 25, \"OPERATING SEGMENTS,\" to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor additional information and a reconciliation of our segment information to the corresponding amounts in our\nConsolidated Statements of Net Income\nEngine segment sales and EBITDA as a percentage of consolidated results were:\n\nMeasured before intersegment eliminations\nThe Components segment designs, manufactures and supplies products which complement the Engine and Power Systems segments, including axles, drivelines, brakes and suspension systems for commercial diesel and natural gas applications, aftertreatment systems, turbochargers, fuel systems, valvetrain technologies, automated transmissions and electronics. We design and develop these products and systems to meet increasingly stringent emission and fuel economy standards.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2024, we realigned certain businesses within our Components segment to be consistent with how our segment leader now monitors performance. We reorganized the businesses to combine the engine components and software and electronics businesses into the newly formed components and software business. In addition, we rebranded our axles and brakes business as drivetrain and braking systems. We began reporting results for these changes within our Components segment effective April 1, 2024, and reflected these changes in the historical periods presented. The change had no impact on our consolidated results.\nThe Components segment is organized around the following businesses:\nDrivetrain and braking systems -\nWe design, manufacture and supply drivetrain systems, including axles, drivelines, brakes and suspension systems primarily for commercial vehicle and industrial applications. We also market and sell truck, trailer, on- and off-highway and other products principally for OEM dealers and other independent distributors and service garages within the aftermarket industry. We primarily serve markets in North America, Europe, South America, India, Asia Pacific and China.\nEmission solutions -\nWe are a global leader in designing, manufacturing and integrating aftertreatment technology and solutions for the commercial on- and off-highway light-duty, medium-duty, heavy-duty and high-horsepower engine markets. Aftertreatment is the mechanism used to convert engine emissions of criteria pollutants, such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons into harmless emissions. Our products include custom engineering systems and integrated controls, oxidation catalysts, particulate filters, selective catalytic reduction systems and engineered components, including dosers. Our emission solutions business primarily serves markets in North America, Europe, China, India, Brazil and Asia Pacific. We serve both OEM first fit and retrofit customers.\nComponents and software -\nWe design, manufacture and market turbocharger, fuel system and valvetrain technologies for light-duty, mid-range, heavy-duty and high-horsepower markets. We also design, develop and supply electronic control modules, sensors and supporting software for on-highway, off-highway and power generation applications. We primarily serve markets in North America, Europe, China and India.\nAutomated transmissions -\nWe develop and supply automated transmissions for the heavy-duty commercial vehicle market. Automated transmissions include automated manual transmissions, dual-clutch transmissions and automatic transmissions for internal combustion engines. The Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies (ECJV) joint venture is a consolidated 50/50 joint venture between Cummins Inc. and Eaton Corporation Plc. and serves markets in North America and China.\nOn March 18, 2024, we completed the divestiture of our remaining 80.5 percent ownership of Atmus common stock through a tax-free split-off. See NOTE 21, \"ATMUS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) AND DIVESTITURE,\" to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor additional information.\nCustomers of the Components segment generally include the Engine, Distribution, Power Systems and Accelera segments, joint ventures including Tata Cummins Ltd., Dongfeng Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. and Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., truck manufacturers and other OEMs, many of which are also customers of the Engine segment, such as PACCAR, Daimler, Volvo, Traton, Tata Motors Ltd. (Tata Motors) and other manufacturers that use our components in their product platforms.\nThe Components segment competes with other manufacturers of aftertreatment systems, turbochargers, fuel systems, drivetrain systems and transmissions. Our primary competitors in these markets include Robert Bosch GmbH, Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Garrett Motion, Inc., Borg-Warner Inc., Tenneco Inc., Eberspacher Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Denso Corporation, Allison Transmission, Aisin Corporation, Knorr-Bremse AG, ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Dana Incorporated.\nDistribution Segment\nDistribution segment sales and EBITDA as a percentage of consolidated results were:\n\nMeasured before intersegment eliminations\nThe Distribution segment is our primary sales, service and support channel. The segment serves our customers and certified dealers through a worldwide network of wholly-owned, joint venture and independent distribution locations. Wholly-owned locations operate and serve markets in the seven geographic regions noted below. Joint venture locations serve markets in South America, Southeast Asia and India while independent distribution locations serve markets in these and other geographies.\nDistribution’s mission encompasses the sale and support of a wide range of products and services, including power generation systems, high-horsepower engines, heavy-duty and medium-duty engines designed for on- and off-highway use, application engineering services, custom-designed assemblies, retail and wholesale aftermarket parts and in-shop and field-based repair services.

In addition, we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nManagement's Assessment of Liquidity\nOur financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. We believe our access to capital markets, our existing cash and marketable securities, operating cash flow and revolving credit facilities provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund targeted capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt service obligations, projected pension obligations, common stock repurchases, joint venture contributions and acquisitions through 2025 and beyond. We continue to generate significant cash from operations and maintain access to our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs as noted above.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is included in NOTE 1, \"SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\" of our\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nwhich discusses accounting policies that we selected from acceptable alternatives.\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nare prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of the Board. We believe our critical accounting estimates include estimating liabilities for warranty programs, fair value of intangible assets, assessing goodwill impairments, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits.\nWe estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of costs to be incurred over the warranty period. Adjustments may be required to the liability when actual or projected costs differ. Variations in component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle are key drivers that impact our periodic re-assessment of the warranty liability. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. We generally estimate warranty accruals for new products using a methodology that includes the preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor derived from prior product launch experience and new product assessments until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. We then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter. Product specific experience is typically available five or six quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when management commits to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable. NOTE 13, \"PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY,\" to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements\ncontains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2024, 2023 and 2022 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties.\nFair Value of Intangible Assets\nWe make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions can be complex and requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value and (ii) the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired intangibles. We estimate the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, which includes estimates of discount rates, revenue growth rates, EBITDA, royalty rates, customer attrition rates, customer renewal rates and technology obsolesce rates. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Although we believe the projections, assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate, these estimates require significant judgment by management, are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded to our\nConsolidated Statements of Net Income\nSee NOTE 23, \"ACQUISITIONS,\" to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor additional information\nabout our recent business combinations.\nWe are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether a goodwill impairment event has occurred, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the operating segments or the components of operating segments that constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management.\nWe have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform an annual quantitative goodwill impairment test. We have elected this option on certain reporting units. The following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount:\nMacroeconomic conditions, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and/or other developments in equity and credit markets;\nIndustry and market considerations, such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, material loss in market share and significant declines in product pricing;\nCost factors, such as an increase in raw materials, labor or other costs;\nOverall financial performance, such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue;\nOther relevant entity-specific events, such as material changes in management or key personnel and\nEvents affecting a reporting unit, such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets including acquisitions and dispositions.\nThe examples noted above are not all-inclusive, and we consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nOur goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process. This process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows. In order to determine the valuation of our reporting units, we use either the income approach using a discounted cash flow model or the market approach. Our income approach method uses a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends.\nThe discounted cash flow model requires us to make projections of revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate a weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects a market rate, for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as a goodwill impairment loss. In addition, we also perform sensitivity analyses to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected\ncash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.\nEffective October 31, 2024, we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date for all reporting units from the last day of our fiscal third quarter to October 31 to better align with the timing of our annual long-term planning process. Accordingly, management determined that the change in accounting principle is preferable. This change was applied prospectively from October 31, 2024. We determined that it is impracticable to objectively ascertain projected cash flows and related valuation estimates that would have been used as of each October 31 of prior reporting periods without the use of hindsight. This change was not material to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nas it did not delay, accelerate or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charges. To ensure that no lapse greater than twelve months occurred, we performed an impairment test, for all reporting units, as of the end of our 2024 fiscal third quarter and noted no impairment. We completed our annual impairment testing as of October 31, 2024, and noted no impairment.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Future tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2024, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of $730 million. The net deferred tax assets included $907 million for the value of net operating loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $872 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets.\nIn addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions. We believe we made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in NOTE 4, \"INCOME TAXES,\" to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nWe sponsor a number of pension plans globally, with the majority of assets in the U.S. and the U.K. In the U.S. and the U.K., we have major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension plans, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December 31. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, inflation, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded passive fixed income and equity indices and forward-looking estimates of the value added by active investment management. At December 31, 2024, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 30-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7 percent, including the additional positive returns expected from active investment management.\nThe one-year return for our U.S. plans was a 5.5 percent gain for 2024. Our U.S. plan assets aver",
