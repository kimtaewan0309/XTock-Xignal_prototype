  "item1_clean": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Home Depot, Inc. is the world’s largest home improvement retailer based on net sales for fiscal 2024. We offer our customers a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, décor products, and facilities MRO products, in stores and online. We also provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services, and tool and equipment rental. As of the end of fiscal 2024, we operated 2,347 stores located throughout the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. We also maintain a network of distribution and fulfillment centers, as well as a number of e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. For disclosure purposes, the geographic operating segments of the U.S., Canada and Mexico are aggregated into one reportable segment (the “Primary segment”).\nIn fiscal 2024, we acquired SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company engaged in the distribution of residential and commercial roofing products, complementary building products, landscape supplies and swimming pool supplies serving the professional roofer, landscaper, and pool contractor. At the end of fiscal 2024, SRS operated over 780 branch locations throughout the U.S., each of which has a distribution center, material handling and delivery equipment, and inventory. SRS is organized as three different lines of business: roofing and complementary building products, landscape, and pool. Each line of business was determined to represent an operating segment, none of which are deemed reportable segments.\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, when we refer to “The Home Depot,” “Home Depot,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate headquarters) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number at that address is (770) 433-8211.\nOUR BUSINESS\nOUR STRATEGY\nThe retail landscape has changed rapidly over the past several years, with a complex macroeconomic environment and customer expectations continually evolving. In fiscal 2024, our strategy allowed us to continue to execute at a high level despite continued pressure on home improvement demand from high interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty. We continued our strategic investments aimed at creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds, growing our market share with Pros through our ecosystem of capabilities, and building new stores. Going forward, we will continue to leverage the momentum of these investments and invest in our business in support of the following goals:\nWe intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement and develop differentiated capabilities for our customers;\nWe intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider in home improvement; and\nWe intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement.\nWe believe that these goals will help us grow faster than the market and deliver value to our shareholders. We are steadfast in our commitments to focus on our people, operate sustainably, and strengthen our communities, and we believe being informed by other stakeholder perspectives will drive shareholder value creation.\nDELIVER SHAREHOLDER VALUE\n\nWe seek to deliver on our objective to create shareholder value through our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our capital allocation principles are as follows:\nFirst, we intend to reinvest in our business to drive growth faster than the market.\nSecond, after meeting the needs of the business, we look to pay a quarterly dividend.\nThird, after reinvesting in our business and paying our dividend, we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases.\nIn fiscal 2024, we invested $3.5 billion in capital expenditures to support our business, advance our goals, and continue to build an interconnected customer experience. We also acquired SRS to accelerate our growth with Pros. We continue to focus on driving productivity throughout the business by lowering our product and transportation costs, and in fiscal 2024 we\nexecuted a plan to reduce our fixed cost structure by approximately $500 million. The combination of reinvesting in our business to drive higher sales and driving productivity to lower costs allows us to improve our customer experience, increase our competitiveness in the market, and deliver shareholder value.\nIn fiscal 2024, we returned $8.9 billion to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. We also returned $0.6 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024 in anticipation of the SRS acquisition. Our capital allocation is discussed further in\nPart II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOUR CUSTOMERS\nWe serve two primary customer groups — consumers (including both DIY and DIFM customers) and Pros — and have developed varying approaches to meet their diverse needs:\nThese customers are typically homeowners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge. We also offer a variety of clinics and workshops to share this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. As the preferences and behaviors of our DIY customers are changing, we are investing in capabilities to better meet the evolving expectations of these customers.\nProfessional Customers (or “Pros”)\nThese customers are primarily professional renovators/remodelers, general contractors, small to medium homebuilders, maintenance professionals, handymen, property managers, building service contractors and specialty tradespeople, such as electricians, landscapers, plumbers, painters, pool contractors, and roofers. These customers build, renovate, remodel, repair, and maintain residential properties, multifamily properties, hospitality properties, and commercial facilities, including education, healthcare, government, institutional, and office buildings.\nWe have a number of initiatives designed to drive growth with Pros, including those working on both simple and complex projects. In fiscal 2024, we acquired SRS, which sells products to specialty trade roofers, landscapers, and pool contractors. We remain focused on providing a customized online experience, a dedicated sales force, a broad assortment of Pro-focused products and brands, an extensive delivery network, our Pro Xtra loyalty program, and enhanced credit offerings. Building on our historical strength as a destination for urgent purchase needs, we are investing in differentiated capabilities that will help us better serve our Pros’ complex purchase needs, including differentiated fulfillment options, additional trade credit offerings including our Pro House Account program, more showroom space, and an enhanced order management system. We also provide MRO products and related value-added services to multifamily, hospitality, healthcare, and government housing facilities, among others, primarily through our subsidiary HD Supply.\nIntersecting our DIY customers and our Pros are our DIFM customers. These customers are typically homeowners who use Pros to complete their projects or installations. Currently, we offer installation services in a variety of categories, such as flooring, water heaters, bath, garage doors, cabinets, cabinet makeovers, countertops, sheds, furnaces and central air systems, and windows. DIFM customers can purchase these services in our stores, online, or in their homes through in-home consultations. In addition to serving our DIFM customer needs, we believe our focus on the Pros who perform services for these customers helps us drive higher product sales.\nOUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nA typical Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 items during the year, including both national brand name and proprietary products, across the following merchandising departments: Appliances, Bath, Building Materials, Electrical, Flooring, Hardware, Indoor Garden, Kitchen & Blinds, Lighting, Lumber, Millwork, Outdoor Garden, Paint, Plumbing, Power, and Storage & Organization. Our online product offerings complement our stores by serving as an extended aisle, and we offer a significantly broader product assortment through our websites and mobile applications, including homedepot.com, our primary website; homedepot.ca and homedepot.com.mx, our websites in Canada and Mexico, respectively; hdsupply.com, our website for our MRO products and related services; our websites for custom window coverings including blinds.com, justblinds.com and americanblinds.com; thecompanystore.com, our website featuring textiles and décor products; and srsdistribution.com, heritagelandscapesupplygroup.com, and heritagepoolsupplygroup.com, our websites serving the roofing and building materials, landscape and pool product needs of specialty Pros, respectively.\nWe believe our merchandising organization is a key competitive advantage, delivering product innovation, assortment and value, which reinforces our position as the product authority in home improvement. At the same time, we remain focused on offering the right products at everyday values in our stores and online. To remain the product authority, we must continue to bring new and innovative products to our customers that help simplify their projects, from the Pro’s need for job-lot quantities of specialized products to DIY customers seeking products to reduce their environmental impacts. To help our merchandising organization keep pace with changing customer expectations and increasing desire for innovation, localization, and personalization, we are continuing to invest in tools to better leverage our data and drive a deeper level of collaboration with our suppliers. As a result, we continue to focus on enhanced merchandising information technology tools to help us: (1) enhance an interconnected shopping experience that remains tailored to our customers’ shopping intent and location; (2) provide the best value in the market; and (3) optimize our product assortments. Our merchandising team leverages technology and works closely with our inventory and supply chain teams, as well as our suppliers, to manage our assortments, drive innovation, manage the cost environment, and adjust inventory levels to respond to fluctuations in demand.\nTo complement our merchandising efforts, we offer a number of services for our customers, including installation services for our DIY and DIFM customers, as noted above. We also provide tool and equipment rentals at locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both Pros and consumers. To improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering, we are continuing to invest in more tool rental locations, more tools, and better technology.\nSourcing and Quality Assurance\nWe maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the world. During fiscal 2024, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Europe. To ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental responsibility, we also have a global responsible sourcing ",

Fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 include 52 weeks.

Sales per retail square foot is a measure of the efficiency of sales based on the total square footage of our stores and is used by management to monitor the performance of the Company’s retail operations as an indicator of the productivity of owned and leased square footage for these retail operations.\nThe 53rd week of fiscal 2024 increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.30.\nFISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023\nWe assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales.\nFiscal 2024 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2023. Net sales for fiscal 2024 increased $6.8 billion, or 4.5%, to $159.5 billion. The increase\nales for fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by SRS, which contributed $6.4 billion of net sales during fiscal 2024, and incremental net sales of approximately $2.5 billion attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2024. This increase in net sales was partially offset by the impact of a negative comparable sales environment, primarily driven by decreases in comparable customer transactions and comparable average ticket.\nOnline sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 15.1% of net sales and increased by 6.6% during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, including the online sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2024.\nA stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by $298 million in fiscal 2024.\nComparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52\nweek of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Our comparable sales results for fiscal 2024 exclude the 53rd week and compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2024 to the 52-week period reported for fiscal 2023. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nTotal comparable sales decreased 1.8% in fiscal 2024, reflecting a 1.0% decrease in comparable customer transactions and a 0.9% decrease in comparable average ticket compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in comparable customer transactions primarily reflects the impact of heightened macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including the impacts of a persisting high interest rate environment pressuring home improvement demand. The decrease in comparable average ticket primarily reflects price stabilization relative to last year, slightly offset by demand for new and innovative products.\n, our Power and Building Materials merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales compared to fiscal 2023. All of our other merchandising departments posted negative comparable sales during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\nGross profit increased $2.3 billion, or 4.6%, to $53.3 billion in fiscal 2024. Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.4% for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, and primarily reflected lower transportation costs and lower shrink within our Primary segment, offset by the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results.\nOur operating expenses are composed of SG&A and depreciation and amortization.\nSelling, General & Administrative.\nSG&A increased $2.2 billion, or 8.1%, to $28.7 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, SG&A was 18.0% in fiscal 2024 compared to 17.4% in fiscal 2023, which primarily reflects higher payroll costs, deleverage from a negative comparable sales environment and lower legal-related benefits.\nDepreciation and Amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $361 million, or 13.5%, to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.9% in fiscal 2024 compared to 1.8% in fiscal 2023\nprimarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense of $239 million, of which $218 million was related to SRS, as well as increased depreciation expense from ongoing investments in the business.\nInterest and Other, net\nInterest and other, net increased $355 million, or 20.1%, to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, interest and other, net, was 1.3% in fiscal 2024 compared to 1.2% in fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher interest expense driven by higher long-term debt.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur combined effective income tax rate was 23.7% in fiscal 2024 compared to 24.0% in fiscal 2023.\nDiluted Earnings per Share\nDiluted earnings per share were $14.91 in fiscal 2024 compared to $15.11 in fiscal 2023. The decrease in diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by lower net earnings during fiscal 2024, partially offset by lower diluted shares. The 53rd week increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.30 for fiscal 2024.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo provide clarity on our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.\nReturn on Invested Capital\nWe believe ROIC is meaningful for management, investors and ratings agencies because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. ROIC is a non-GAAP profitability measure, not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.\nThe following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure):\nInterest and other, net\nProvision for income taxes\nIncome tax adjustment\nNOPAT\nAverage debt and equity\nROIC\nNote: Fiscal 2024 includes 53 weeks. Fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 include 52 weeks.\nIncome tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months.\nFiscal 2024 only includes operating results for SRS since the acquisition date of June 18, 2024, consistent with our consolidated financial statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt February 2, 2025, we had $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.1 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and fund any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.\nOur material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In March 2024, we paused share repurchases in anticipation of the acquisition of SRS and do not have plans to resume share repurchases in fiscal 2025.\nDuring fiscal 2024, we invested approximately $3.5 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. In line with our expectation of approximately 2.5% of fiscal 2025 net sales, we plan to invest approximately $4 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, with investments across initiatives to improve the customer experience, including through technology and development of other differentiated capabilities, to continue to mature and build out Pro capabilities, as well as to build new stores. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate. We may also utilize strategic acquisitions to help accelerate our strategic initiatives.\nDuring fiscal 2024, we paid cash dividends of $8.9 billion to shareholders. In February 2025, we announced a 2.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $2.25 to $2.30 per share. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by our Board based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board.\nIn August 2023, our Board approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved in August 2022. The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As of February 2, 2025, approximately $11.7 billion of the $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available. During fiscal 2024, we made cash payments of $649 million for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases, prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024 as discussed above.\nDEBT\nAt the beginning of fiscal 2024, we had a commercial paper program that allowed for an aggregate of $5.0 billion in borrowings. In connection with our program, we had back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for an aggregate of $5.0 billion in borrowings, which consisted of a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2024.\nIn May 2024, we increased our commercial paper program from $5.0 billion to $19.5 billion in connection with the anticipated financing of the acquisition of SRS (see\nto our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the SRS acquisition). In May 2024, in connection with the increase in the commercial paper program, we entered into three additional back-up credit facilities that consisted of a 364-day $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025, a three-year $1.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2027, and a 364-day $10.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025. The $10.0 billion credit facility also provided that the commitments and any borrowings under that facility would be reduced by the amount of net cash proceeds we receive from any future debt issuance.\nIn June 2024, leading up to the acquisition of SRS on June 18, 2024, we raised commercial paper borrowings of over $15.0 billion to fund the transaction. On June 25, 2024, we received the proceeds from the issuance of $10.0 billion of long-term debt, as further discussed below, and immediately used the proceeds to repay approximately $10.0 billion of these commercial paper borrowings. On June 27, 2024, we terminated the $10.0 billion back-up credit facility, and subsequently reduced our commercial paper program from $19.5 billion to $9.5 billion.\nIn July 2024, we completed the renewal of our 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility, extending the maturity from July 2024 to July 2025.\nIn December 2024, we reduced our total credit facilities and concurrently reduced our commercial paper program, each by $2.5 billion. This reduction included terminating the three-year $1.0 billion back-up credit facility that was scheduled to expire in May 2027 and reducing the aggregate commitments under the 364-day back-up credit facility that is scheduled to expire in May 2025 from $3.5 billion to $2.0 billion. As of February 2, 2025, our commercial paper program allowed for an aggregate of $7.0 billion in borrowings and is supported by $7.0 billion of back-up credit facilities.\nAll of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2024 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $15.3 billion. At February 2, 2025, we had outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program of $316 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.4%, we had no outstanding borrowings under our back-up credit facilities, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.\nWe also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. As discussed above, in June 2024, we issued $10.0 billion of senior notes in connection with the funding of the acquisition of SRS. Separately, in February 2024, we repaid $1.1 billion of senior notes at maturity. At February 2, 2025, we had an aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding of $51.1 billion, with $4.3 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with these senior notes total $27.1 billion, with $2.1 billion payable within 12 months, based on current interest rates, which include the impact of our active interest rate swap agreements.\nThe indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing our notes contain various customary covenants; however, none of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. We were in compliance with all such covenants at February 2, 2025. See\nto our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements.\nLEASES\nWe use operating and finance leases largely to obtain a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers. At February 2, 2025, we had aggregate remaining lease payment obligations of $15.2 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. Aggregate lease obligations include approximately $560 million of obligations related to leases not yet commenced. See\nto our consolidated f",
