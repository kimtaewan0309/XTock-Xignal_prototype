At Tapestry, each brand has a dedicated design and merchandising team; this ensures that Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman speak to their customers with a voice and positioning unique to\ntheir brand. Designers have access to the brands' extensive archives of product designs, which are a valuable resource for product concepts. Our designers collaborate with strong merchandising teams that analyze sales, market trends and consumer preferences to identify market opportunities that help guide each season's design process and create a globally relevant product assortment. Leveraging our strategic investments that we have made in data and analytics tools, merchandisers are able to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior which empowers our teams to respond to changes in consumer preferences and demand as well as scale opportunities across brands with greater speed and efficiency. Our merchandising teams are committed to managing the product life cycle to maximize sales and profitability across all business channels. The product category teams, each comprised of design, merchandising, product development and sourcing specialists, help each brand execute design concepts that are consistent with the brand's strategic direction.\nOur design and merchandising teams also work in close collaboration with all of our licensing partners to ensure that the licensed products are conceptualized and designed to address the intended market opportunity and convey the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with our brands.\nMARKETING\nOur marketing objective is to build emotional connections with consumers to drive acquisition. We use a 360-degree approach to marketing for each of our brands, synchronizing our efforts across all business channels to ensure consistency at every touchpoint. Our global marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent, relevant and multi-layered message every time the consumer comes in contact with our brands through our communications, visual merchandising and customer experiences. Each brand's distinctive positioning is communicated by our creative marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams, as well as outside creative agencies. We also have a sophisticated consumer and market research capability and leverage third-party experts to gain insights into consumer attitudes and trends.\nWe engage in many consumer communication initiatives globally, including activities at a national, regional and local level. Total expenses attributable to the Company's marketing-related activities in fiscal 2025 were $744.5 million, representing nearly 11% of net sales, compared to $616.8 million in fiscal 2024, representing over 9% of net sales.\nOur wide range of marketing activities utilize a variety of media, including digital, social, television, print and out-of-home. Our respective brand websites serve as effective communication vehicles by providing an immersive brand experience, showcasing the fullest expression across product categories.\nAs part of our direct marketing strategy, we use databases of consumers to generate personalized communications in direct channels such as email and text messages to drive engagement. Visitors to our e-commerce sites provide an opportunity to increase the size of these consumer databases, in addition to serving as a point of transactions globally, except where restricted.\nThe Company has several regional informational websites for locations where we have not established an e-commerce presence. The Company utilizes social media and continues to explore digital technologies to create emotional connections with consumers, acquire new customers and build brand awareness, in addition to increasing on-line and store sales.\nMANUFACTURING\nTapestry carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners that have demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable delivery. The Company continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver high quality products at competitive costs and to mitigate the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets.\nOur raw material suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain high quality standards, which are an integral part of our brands' identity. Before directly partnering with a new manufacturing vendor for finished goods, the Company evaluates each facility by conducting a quality, business practice standards and social compliance review. We expect finished good manufacturers to undergo a social compliance audit before being approved as a Tapestry supplier. Manufacturers working with our licensed partners are expected to have had an acceptable social compliance audit conducted within the prior six months of their onboarding date. Suppliers that fail to meet our standards are not approved until an acceptable report is provided. We also conduct periodic evaluations of existing, previously approved finished good suppliers. We believe that our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with the Company’s integrity standards.\nThese independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new, fashion-oriented styles, which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences.\nWe have longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware. Although our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers, we maintain a strong level of oversight in the selection of key raw materials and compliance with quality control standards is monitored through on-site quality inspections at independent manufacturing facilities.\nWe maintain strong oversight of the supply chain process for each of our brands from design through manufacturing. We are able to do this by maintaining sourcing management offices in Vietnam, mainland China, the Philippines, Cambodia and\nSpain that work closely with our independent manufacturers. This broad-based, global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction capabilities.\nDuring fiscal 2025, manufacturers of Coach products were primarily located in Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines and India and no individual vendor provided 10% or more of the brand's total inventory purchases. During fiscal 2025, Kate Spade products were manufactured primarily in Vietnam, Cambodia, mainland China, and the Philippines and no individual vendor provided 10% or more of the brand's total inventory purchases. Stuart Weitzman products were primarily manufactured in Spain. During fiscal 2025, Stuart Weitzman had one vendor, located in Spain, who individually provided approximately 11% of the brand's total inventory purchases.\nFULFILLMENT\nThe Company’s distribution network is designed to support the movement of each brand's products from our manufacturers to fulfillment centers around the world. These fulfillment centers are either directly operated by the Company or by independent third parties, some of which support multiple brands. Our facilities use bar code scanning warehouse management systems, where our fulfillment center employees use handheld scanners to read product bar codes. This allows for accurate storage and order processing and allows us to provide excellent service to our customers. These facilities are also integrated into our Enterprise Resource Planning system, ensuring accurate inventory reporting. Our products are primarily shipped to retail stores, wholesale customers and e-commerce customers.\nIn North America, we maintain fulfillment centers in Florida, Nevada and Ohio, operated by Tapestry. The Company also has third-party facilities in Canada and Mexico. Globally, we utilize regional fulfillment centers in mainland China, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Spain, owned and operated by third parties, that support multiple countries. We also utilize local fulfillment centers, through third parties in Japan, parts of Greater China, South Korea, Malaysia and Australia.\nINFORMATION SYSTEMS\nThe Company’s information systems are integral in supporting the Company’s long-term strategies. Our robust information technology platform serves as a foundation to drive growth and enhance consumer centricity initiatives, and enable data-driven decision making. We are continually enhancing our digital technology platforms to elevate our e-commerce capabilities, strengthen DTC functionalities, and deliver a seamless overall omni-channel experience leveraging modern and cloud-based technologies. During fiscal 2025, we continued to enhance our artificial intelligence, both predictive and generative, and machine learning models for areas such as data analytics, planning, marketing, customer journey personalization, pricing and product creation, to improve our customer capture and segmentation capabilities for more tailored and effective engagement.\nThe Company utilizes a cloud-based digital platform which integrates critical components of our businesses including our customer shopping sites, Order Management Systems, Point of Sale systems, Customer Services, Enterprise Resource Planning systems and product management systems into one cohesive platform with a shared codebase. This unified platform allows us to be a more dynamic and responsive company providing best-in-class service to our customers across all brands in North America, Europe and Japan.\nRefer to Part I, Item 1C, \"Cybersecurity\" for further information on our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nTapestry owns COACH, KATE SPADE and STUART WEITZMAN, as well as all of the material trademark, design and patent-rights related to the production, marketing, distribution and sale of our products in the United States and other countries in which our products are principally sold.

This increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to an increase of 210 basis points in gross margin partially offset by 90 basis points increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales.\nCoach Operating Income\nincreased $224.2 million to $1.88 billion in fiscal 2025, resulting in an operating margin increase of 110 basis points to 33.5%, as compared to $1.65 billion and 32.4%, respectively in fiscal 2024. This increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to:\n, increased 200 basis points mainly due to net pricing improvements;\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales\n, increased 90 basis points mainly due to higher marketing spend, partially offset by leverage of fixed costs on higher net sales.\nKate Spade Operating Loss\nincreased $901.8 million to a loss of $769.2 million in fiscal 2025, resulting in an operating margin of (64.3)%, as compared to income of $132.6 million and 9.9%, respectively in fiscal 2024.

Excluding items affecting comparability, Corporate operating expenses increased $40.6 million to $553.1 million from $512.5 million in fiscal 2024.

Excluding items affecting comparability, Interest expense, net, increased $16.9 million to $25.2 million from $8.3 million in fiscal 2024. This increase in net interest expense was mainly due to an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of the 2030 and 2035 Senior Notes and borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the Term Loan due 2027.\nOther Expense (Income)\nOther income increased $9.8 million to Other income of $6.6 million in fiscal 2025 as compared to Other expense of $3.2 million in fiscal 2024.

This change was primarily due to higher net income and a decrease in shares outstanding.\nFISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023\nwithin Part II. Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\".\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nThe Company’s reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. The reported SG&A expenses, Operating income, Interest expense, Provision for income taxes, Net income and earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 and the reported Loss on extinguishment of debt in fiscal 2025, reflect certain items affecting comparability, including the impact of Acquisition and Divestiture Costs, Organizational Efficiency Costs and Impairment charges. As a supplement to the Company's reported results, these measures are also reported on a non-GAAP basis to exclude the impact of these items along with a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nThe Company incurred Acquisition and Divestiture Costs which consist of non-recurring acquisition and divestiture costs, primarily financing-related expenses and professional fees from the terminated Capri Acquisition as well as costs related to the Stuart Weitzman Business Divestiture, inclusive of the loss on business held for sale, professional fees, share-based compensation expense and store impairment. The Company also incurred Organizational Efficiency Costs which consist of non-recurring costs, primarily from various initiatives aimed at streamlining the organization and optimizing processes. These costs mainly include one-time severance and technology related charges. Impairment charges incurred by the Company consist of non-recurring impairment costs related to Kate Spade indefinite-lived brand intangible assets and goodwill.\nThese non-GAAP performance measures were used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected. Management and the Company’s Board utilized these non-GAAP measures to make decisions about the uses of Company resources, analyze performance between periods, develop internal projections and measure management performance. The Company’s internal management reporting excluded these items. In addition, the human resources committee of the Company’s Board uses these non-GAAP measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals.\nThe Company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and profit. Accordingly, certain material increases and decreases in operating results for the Company and its segments have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects. These effects occur from translating foreign-denominated amounts into U.S. dollars and comparing to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company calculates constant currency revenue results by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year period's currency conversion rate.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and others in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the Company’s historical performance. Additionally, we believe presenting certain increases and decreases in constant currency provides a framework for assessing the performance of the Company's business outside the United States and helps investors and analysts understand the effect of significant year-over-year currency fluctuations. We believe excluding these items assists investors and others in developing expectations of future performance.\nBy providing the non-GAAP measures, as a supplement to GAAP information, we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nFor a detailed discussion on these non-GAAP measures, see the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation discussions above in this Item 7. \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nCash Flows - Fiscal 2025 Compared to Fiscal 2024\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n\nITEM 7.
