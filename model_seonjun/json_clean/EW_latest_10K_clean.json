  "item1_clean": "an individual's heart. Our vision is to transform patient care where patients are diagnosed earlier, treated in a routine fashion, live longer, and enjoy a better quality of life. Our future growth opportunities include offering solutions for treating patients with both valvular and non-valvular structural heart disease, such as heart failure, which is a natural progression of the disease for many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.\nPatients undergoing treatment for cardiovascular disease can be treated with a number of our medical technologies, which are designed to address individual patient needs with respect to disease process, comorbidities, and health status. For example, an individual with a heart valve disorder may have a faulty valve that is affecting the function of his or her heart or blood flow throughout his or her body. A cardiac surgeon may elect to remove the valve and replace it with one of our bioprosthetic surgical tissue heart valves or surgically re-shape and repair the faulty valve with an Edwards annuloplasty ring. Alternatively, a clinician (typically an interventional cardiologist) may implant an Edwards transcatheter valve or repair system via a catheter-based approach that does not require traditional open-heart surgery and can be done while the heart continues to beat.\nOur research and development activities are conducted primarily in facilities located in the United States and Israel. Our experienced research and development staff are focused on product design and development, quality, clinical research, and regulatory compliance. To pursue primary research efforts, we have developed alliances with several leading research institutions and universities, and also work with leading clinicians around the world in conducting scientific studies on our existing and developing products.\nProprietary Technology\nPatents, trademarks, and other proprietary rights are important to the success of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing innovations, licensing opportunities, and non-disclosure agreements to develop and maintain our competitive position.\nWe own or have rights to a substantial number of patents and have patent applications pending both in the United States and in foreign countries. We continue to innovate and file new patent applications to protect our new products and technologies.\nAdditionally, we are a party to license agreements and other arrangements with various third parties pursuant to which we have obtained, for varying terms, the exclusive or non-exclusive rights to certain patents held by such third parties in consideration for cross-licensing rights and/or royalty payments. We have also licensed certain patent rights to others.\nWe undertake reasonable measures to protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation has been necessary to enforce certain patent rights held by us, and we plan to continue to defend and prosecute our rights with respect to such patents.\nMoreover, we own certain United States registered trademarks used in our business. Many of our trademarks have also been registered for use in certain foreign countries where registration is available and where we have determined it is commercially advantageous to do so.\nGovernment Regulation and Other Matters\nOur products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA, European Union (\"EU\") member states competent authorities, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. These entities confirm our compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our products.\nWe are also governed by federal, state, local, and international laws of general applicability, including, but not limited to, those regulating employee health and safety, labor, competition, governance and securities, privacy, anti-corruption, trade secret, commercial, trade, and the protection of the environment. Overall, the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date, but new regulations, amendments to existing regulations, or new interpretations of existing regulations could have such an effect in the future. We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business.\nUnited States Regulation.\nIn the United States, the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices. The FDA regulates the design, development, testing, clinical studies, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, and record keeping for medical devices, and reporting of adverse events, recalls, or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Many of our devices that we develop and market are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and pre-market clearance or approval requirements. The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive, lengthy, and costly. A number of our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales. Ultimately, the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other regulatory standards. Additionally, even if a product is cleared or approved, the FDA may impose restrictions or require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized.\nThe FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order the repair, replacement, or refund of the costs of such devices, or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear to be violative of its regulations. The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the quality system regulations concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and current medical device reporting regulations, recall regulations, clinical testing regulations, and other requirements. The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards, or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval, and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. Additionally, the failure to comply with FDA regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, recalls, refunds, civil money penalties, or criminal prosecution. Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review. Moreover, the FDA and several other United States agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the United States and the import of medical devices into the United States, which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance.\nWe are also subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations, products, and technologies, including:\nfederal, state, and foreign anti-kickback laws and regulations, which generally prohibit payments to anyone, including physicians, as an inducement to purchase or recommend a product;\nthe Stark law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician's immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider;\nfederal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of such information, in particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996;\nthe Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of United States physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers, including medical device, pharmaceutical, and biologics companies;\nthe False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program, and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payor; and\nthe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which can be used to prosecute United States companies for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties, or for not keeping accurate financial records or maintaining adequate internal controls to prevent and detect arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability, significant fines or penalties, negative publicity, and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation and enforcement activities. To assist in our compliance efforts, we work to adhere to our many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our business activities in the United States and other countries in which we operate. In addition, we have in place a dedicated team to improve our internal business compliance programs and policies.\nRegulation Outside of the United States.\nOutside of the United States, the regulation of medical devices is also complex. In Europe, our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. The regulatory regime in the EU for medical devices became mandatory in June 1998. It requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed, maintained, and used in accordance with their intended purpose. National laws conforming to the EU's legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system. Although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive, individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions. The EU medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark. Manufacturers' quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body. In Europe, particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities.\nIn May 2017, the EU implemented a new regulatory scheme for medical devices under the Medical Device Regulation (\"MDR\"). The MDR became effective on May 26, 2021, and brought significant new requirements for many medical devices, including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation, increased focus on device identification and traceability, new definitions and registration of economic operators throughout the distribution chain, and additional post-market surveillance and vigilance. Compliance with the MDR requires re-certification of many of our products to the enhanced standards, and has resulted in and will continue to result in substantial additional expense. In addition, in the European Economic Area, we import some of our devices to supply product to Switzerland. Switzerland is not a member state of the EU, but is linked to the EU through bilateral treaties; therefore, the free movement of goo",

In September 2024, we received CE mark for the\ntranscatheter pulmonary valve system with\nadaptive prestent for use in the management of patients with severe pulmonary regurgitation.\nTranscatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies\nThe increase in net sales of TMTT products was due primarily to higher sales of our\nPASCAL\ntranscatheter edge-to-edge repair system and our continued launch of the\nEVOQUE\ntricuspid valve replacement system in the United States and Europe.\nSurgical Structural Heart\nNet sales of Surgical products increased in 2024 primarily due to higher sales of the\nINSPIRIS RESILIA\naortic valve in the United States and Europe, the\nKONECT RESILIA\ntissue valved conduit in the United States, and the\nMITRIS RESILIA\nvalve in the United States.\nWe have completed enrollment in the United States and Canada of patients in our MOMENTIS clinical study to demonstrate the durability of\nRESILIA\ntissue in the mitral position.\nOur gross profit increased in 2024, driven by our sales growth discussed above. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2024 compared to 2023 was driven by a 0.6 percentage point impact from foreign currency rate fluctuations, including the settlement of foreign currency hedging contracts.\nSelling, General, and Administrative (\"SG&A\") Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to (a) higher field-based personnel-related costs in support of our growth strategy initiatives, primarily in the United States and Europe, (b) costs associated with our recent business combinations and (c) professional services costs to support a transition services agreement.\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\") Expenses\nR&D expenses increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to continued investments in our aortic transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity, higher personnel-related costs in support of our growth strategy initiatives, and costs associated with our recent business combinations.\nIntellectual Property Agreement and Certain Litigation Expenses\nWe incurred certain expenses related to intellectual property litigation and tax litigation of $40.4 million and $203.5 million during 2024 and 2023, respectively. On April 12, 2023, we entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement (the \"Intellectual Property Agreement\") with Medtronic, Inc. (\"Medtronic\") and recorded a $37.0 million charge in March 2023 and a $139.0 million charge in April 2023. For more information, see Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Liabilities, net\nThe change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted in gains of $26.2 million during 2023, primarily due to changes in projected probabilities of milestone achievement.\nRestructuring Charges, Separation Costs, and Other\nIn September 2024, we recorded an expense of $32.9 million primarily related to severance expenses associated with a global workforce realignment impacting approximately 360 employees. As of December 31, 2024, our remaining severance obligations of $20.1 million (included in\nAccrued and Other Liabilities\n) are expected to be substantially paid within the next 12 months.\nOn June 3, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Critical Care to BD and the sale closed on September 3, 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded expenses of $19.0 million, primarily related to costs incurred for consulting, legal, tax, and other professional advisory services associated with the sale.\nIn September 2022, we decided to exit our\nHARPOON\nsurgical mitral repair system program. As a result, we recorded expenses of $62.3 million, of which $60.7 million was included in\nRestructuring Charges, Separation Costs and Other\nand $1.6 million was included in\non the consolidated statements of operations. The charge primarily related to the full impairment of intangible assets associated with the technology for $52.7 million and other related exit costs.\nFor more information, see Note 4 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nOther Operating Income, net\nOther operating income of $0.3 million in 2024 included income from a transition services agreement of $30.3 million (see Note 5 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements)\n, partially offset by a $30.0 million charge for a charitable contribution to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation.\nInterest expense was $19.8 million and $17.6 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from lower capitalizable interest related to facilities construction.\nInterest income was $120.3 million and $67.2 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in interest income resulted primarily from a higher average investment balance and a higher average yield on our investments.\nOther Non-operating Income, net\nOther non-operating income was $68.9 million and $13.9 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in other income was driven primarily by gains from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interests upon acquisition\nof the investees. For more information, see Note 10 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n\nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations\nTransition tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits (a)\nLitigation settlement obligation (minimum payments)\nPension obligations (b)\nPurchase and other commitments (c)\nTotal contractual cash obligations (d), (e)\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(a) As of December 31, 2024, we had recorded $78.5 million of income tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the 2017 Act. The transition tax is due in eight annual installments, with the first seven installments paid in 2018 through 2024. The remaining installment amount will be equal to 25% of the total liability\npayable in 2025. See Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor additional information about the one-time transition tax.\n(b) The amount included in \"Year 1\" reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans. Anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. The total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of December 31, 2024 was $32.1 million. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment returns on plan assets. Therefore, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. See Note 15 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor further information.\n(c) Purchase and other commitments consists primarily of open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the normal course of business. We have excluded open purchase orders with a remaining term of less than one year. For certain purchase and other commitments, such as commitments to fund equity method or other investments, the timing of the payment is not certain. In these cases, the maturity dates in the table reflect our best estimates.\n(d) As of December 31, 2024, the gross liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest, was $786.7 million and relates primarily to transfer pricing matters. Based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. In addition, we plan to vigorously contest through the judicial process the additional tax claimed by the IRS related to transfer pricing issues for the 2015 through 2017 tax years which may require additional cash outflows. See Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor further information on these matters.\n(e) We acquire assets still in development, enter into research and development arrangements, acquire businesses, and sponsor certain clinical trials that often require milestone, royalty, or other future payments to third-parties, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. We have excluded from the table above those contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial, certain sales-based royalties in excess of minimum payment thresholds related to litigation settlements, and obligations under an acquisition agreement that has not yet closed. We estimate that these contingent payments could be up to $2.5 billion if all milestones or other contingent obligations are met.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n. Certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). In evaluating our transactions, management assesses all relevant GAAP and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.\nThe application of accounting policies requires the use of judgments and estimates. These matters that are subject to judgments and estimates are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. We also use outside experts where appropriate. We apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.\nWe believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.\nWhen we recognize revenue from the sale of our products, the amount of consideration we ultimately receive varies depending upon the return terms, sales rebates, discounts, and other incentives that we may offer, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. The estimate of variable consideration requires significant judgment. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely upon an assessment of historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. Product returns are typically not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt. If the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate the variable consideration do not approximate future activity, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be impacted.\nIn addition, in limited circumstances, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products, such as for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.\nOur sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our United States distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer. We validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributor's inventory. This distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates. We periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and involves the use of estimates and assumptions, such as projected revenues, projected gross margins, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates, expected technology life cycles, and useful lives of assets. Discount rates may vary across acquisitions based on the purchase price, forecasts, and relative risks of each acquired company. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.\nIntangible Assets and Long-lived Assets\nWe acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases. The acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The determination of fair value requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, projected revenues, projected gross margins, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, including the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks. Discount rates may vary across acquisitions based on the purchase price, forecasts, and relative risks of each acquired company.\nIn-process research and development assets acquired in business combinations is reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Additionally, management reviews the c",
