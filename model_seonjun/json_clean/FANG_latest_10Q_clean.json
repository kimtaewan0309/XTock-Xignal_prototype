MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in this report as well as our audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our\nfor the year ended December 31, 2024. The following discussion contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. See\nPart II. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company currently focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. As discussed in Note 1—\nDescription of the Business and Basis of Presentation\nof the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2025, we have one reportable segment, the upstream segment.\nThird Quarter 2025 Financial and Operating Highlights\nRecorded net income of $1.0 billion.\nPaid dividends to stockholders of $289 million during the third quarter of 2025 and declared a base cash dividend payable in the fourth quarter of 2025 of $1.00 per share of common stock.\nIncreased our common stock repurchase program authorization to $8.0 billion, excluding excise taxes, repurchased $603 million of our common stock, excluding excise taxes, and had approximately $3.1 billion available for future repurchases under our common stock repurchase program at September 30, 2025.\nOur cash operating costs were $10.05 per BOE, including lease operating expenses of $5.65 per BOE, cash general and administrative expenses of $0.55 per BOE and production and ad valorem taxes of $2.44 per BOE and gathering, processing and transportation expenses of $1.41 per BOE.\nOur average production was 942.9 MBOE/d.\nDrilled 107 gross horizontal wells in the Midland Basin and one gross horizontal well in the Delaware Basin and turned 137 gross operated horizontal wells (137 in the Midland Basin and none in the Delaware Basin) to production.\nCash capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $774 million.\nTransactions and Recent Developments\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nDiamondback Divestitures\nOn October 31, 2025, we divested our 27.5% equity interest in EPIC pursuant to a definitive purchase and sale agreement with Plains for approximately $504 million in cash and an additional $96 million in contingent consideration. On October 31, 2025, we used $500 million of the cash proceeds received from the EPIC Divestiture to partially repay principal borrowings under the Company’s 2025 Term Loan.\nDivestiture of Water Assets to Deep Blue\nOn October 1, 2025, we divested EDS to Deep Blue, which was originally acquired in connection with the Endeavor Acquisition, in exchange for upfront net cash proceeds of $694 million and the potential for us to earn up to an additional $200 million in contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain completion thresholds for the years 2026 through 2028. As part of the divestiture, the Company renewed its 15-year dedication to Deep Blue for its produced water and supply water within a 12-county area of mutual interest in the Midland Basin. The cash proceeds from the divestiture were used to repay borrowings under the Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes.\nViper Acquisitions and Divestitures\nPending Viper Divestiture of Non-Permian Assets\nOn October 30, 2025, Viper entered into an equity interest purchase agreement to divest all its non-Permian assets, including those acquired from Sitio, for a purchase price of approximately $670 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The properties to be divested consist of approximately 9,400 net royalty acres in the Denver-Julesburg, Eagle Ford and Williston basins with current production of approximately 4,750 BO/d. The Pending Viper Non-Permian Divestiture is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.\nOn August 19, 2025, Viper and Viper LLC completed the Sitio Acquisition in an all-equity transaction valued at approximately $4.0 billion, subject to further adjustments for transaction costs and certain customary post-closing adjustments, including the retirement of Sitio’s net debt of $1.2 billion. The mineral and royalty interests acquired in the Sitio Acquisition represent approximately 25,300 net royalty acres in the Permian Basin and approximately 9,000 net royalty acres in the Denver-Julesburg, Eagle Ford and Williston basins, for total acreage of approximately 34,300 net royalty acres.\nCapital Transactions\nViper 2025 Notes Offering and Redemption of Notes\nOn July 23, 2025, Viper LLC issued the Viper 2025 Notes for an aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion. Viper used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Viper 2025 Notes to redeem or satisfy and discharge, as applicable, approximately $780 million in aggregate principal amount of their previously outstanding senior notes, including accrued interest paid and redemption premiums. The Viper 2027 Notes were subsequently redeemed in full on November 1, 2025. Viper used the remaining net proceeds (i) to retire Sitio’s 7.875% senior notes due 2028, (ii) to repay borrowings under Sitio’s revolving credit facility, (iii) to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the redemption or repayment of such debt, and (iv) for general corporate purposes.\nIn connection with the closing of the Sitio Acquisition, Viper LLC entered into the $500 million Viper Term Loan, which Viper drew in a single borrowing to partially fund the retirement of Sitio’s debt.\nof the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the capital transactions above.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, we opportunistically repurchased principal amounts of $152 million of our 4.400% Senior Notes due 2051 and $51 million of our 4.250% Senior Notes due 2052 in open market transactions for total cash consideration of $167 million, including accrued interest paid, at an average of 82.3% of par value.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nof the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the transactions above.\nCommodity Prices and Impairment\nPrices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, changes in trade or other government policies or regulations, including with respect to tariffs or other trade barriers, and any resulting trade tensions, extreme weather conditions and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. During the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, WTI prices averaged $66.65 and $77.61 per Bbl, respectively, and Henry Hub prices averaged $3.48 and $2.22 per MMBtu, respectively.\nGiven the overall decline in SEC Prices through the first three quarters of 2025 and into the fourth quarter of 2025 as compared to 2024, we believe a material non-cash impairment of our assets is reasonably likely to occur in the fourth quarter of 2025. In addition to commodity prices, our production rates, levels of proved reserves, future development costs, transfers of unevaluated properties, income tax rate assumptions and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analysis in future periods. Based on the number of factors that may impact our future estimate of proved reserves, we are currently unable to determine an estimate of the amount or range of amounts of any potential impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2025. Impairment charges affect our results of operations but do not reduce our cash flow.\nFor additional information around risks related to commodity prices, see\nPart II. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Commodity Price Risk\nOur activities are primarily directed at the horizontal development of the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations in the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations in the Delaware Basin within the Permian Basin. Additionally, our publicly-traded subsidiary, Viper, is focused on owning and acquiring mineral interests and royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties primarily in the Permian Basin and derives royalty income and lease bonus income from such interests.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had approximately 862,019 net acres in the Permian Basin, which primarily consisted of approximately 751,146 net acres in the Midland Basin and 110,873 net acres in the Delaware Basin.\nThe following table sets forth the total number of operated horizontal wells drilled and completed during the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025\nThe average lateral length for the wells completed during the third quarter of 2025 was 11,020 feet. Operated completions during the third quarter of 2025 consisted of 28 Lower Spraberry wells, 27 Wolfcamp A wells, 27 Wolfcamp B wells, 26 Jo Mill wells, 11 Middle Spraberry wells, 10 Dean wells, four Barnett wells, three Upper Spraberry wells and one Wolfcamp D.\nThe average lateral length for the wells completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was 12,060 feet. Operated completions during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, consisted of 80 Wolfcamp B wells, 77 Lower Spraberry wells, 71 Wolfcamp A wells, 54 Jo Mill wells, 32 Middle Spraberry wells, 22 Dean wells, 13 Upper Spraberry wells, 10 Barnett wells, eight Third Bone Spring wells, seven Wolfcamp D wells and two Second Bone Spring wells"
