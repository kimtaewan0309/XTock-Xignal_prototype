  "item1_clean": "We are one of the leading cruise companies in the world. We own and operate three global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises (collectively, our \"Global Brands\"). We also own a 50% joint venture interest in TUI Cruises GmbH (\"TUIC\"), which operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\"). We account for our investments in our Partner Brands under the equity method of accounting. Together, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands have a combined fleet of 68 ships in the cruise vacation industry with an aggregate capacity of approximately 166,900 berths as of December 31, 2024. Our ships offer a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on more than 1,000 destinations on all seven continents.\nWe compete principally by operating our portfolio of valued brands that deliver vacation experiences known for exceptional product offerings and service provided by our dedicated crew. Our competitive edge is grounded in our focus on innovation, best evidenced in the quality and variety of ships in our fleet, our growing portfolio of private destinations and experiences, and a range of itineraries and global destinations tailored to meet diverse guest preferences. By continually reimagining vacation possibilities and investing in the maintenance and enhancement of our fleet, we inspire both new travelers and loyal repeat guests to embark on unforgettable journeys with us.\nRoyal Caribbean was founded in 1968 as a partnership. Its corporate structure has evolved over the years and, the current parent corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., was incorporated on July 23, 1985 in the Republic of Liberia under the Business Corporation Act of Liberia.\nOur Global Brands include Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises. We believe our Global Brands possess the versatility to enter multiple market segments within the vacation industry. Although each of our Global Brands has its own marketing style, as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our Global Brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our Global Brands have historically sourced passengers from similar markets around the world and operated in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, we strategically manage our Global Brands as a single business with the ultimate objective of maximizing long-term shareholder value.\nRoyal Caribbean is the world's largest cruise vacation brand. The brand competes in both the contemporary family market and premium segments of the vacation industry appealing to both families with children of all ages and older and younger couples. Royal Caribbean offers vacation experiences that generally feature a casual ambiance, as well as a variety of activities and entertainment venues. We believe that the quality of the Royal Caribbean brand allows it to achieve market coverage that is among the broadest of any of the major cruise brands in the cruise vacation industry. Royal Caribbean's strategy is to attract an array of vacationing guests by offering a wide variety of itineraries to destinations worldwide, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Panama Canal and New Zealand, with cruise lengths generally ranging from three to 14 nights. Royal Caribbean offers multiple innovative options for onboard dining, entertainment and other onboard activities. Because of the brand’s ability to deliver extensive and innovative product offerings at an excellent value to consumers, we believe Royal Caribbean is well positioned to attract new consumers to cruising and to continue to bring loyal repeat guests back for their next vacation.\nRoyal Caribbean operates 28 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 105,400 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, Royal Caribbean had three ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,900 berths. The ships on order include the second Icon-class ship,\nthe third Icon-class ship, and the seventh Oasis-class ship, which are expected to be delivered in 2025, 2026, and 2028, respectively. In addition, during 2024, we entered into an agreement with Meyer Turku Oy to build a fourth Icon-class ship for delivery in 2027. The agreement is contingent upon completion of certain conditions precedent including financing.\nCelebrity Cruises is positioned within the premium segment of the vacation industry. Celebrity Cruises’ strategy is to target consumers by delivering a destination-rich experience on upscale ships that offer, among other things, excellent food and drink, elevated hospitality, world-class spaces and accommodations, and live entertainment. Celebrity Cruises offers a range of itineraries to destinations, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, New Zealand, the Panama Canal and South America, with cruise lengths generally ranging from three to 18 nights.\nCelebrity Cruises operates 14 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 35,650 berths. As of December 31, 2024, Celebrity Cruises had one Edge-class ship on order,\nwith an aggregate capacity of approximately 3,250 berths, which is expected to be delivered in 2025. In addition, during 2024, we entered into an agreement with Chantiers de l' Atlantique to build a sixth Edge-class ship for delivery in 2028. The agreement is contingent upon completion of certain conditions precedent including financing.\nSilversea Cruises is an ultra-luxury and expedition cruise line with smaller ships, high standards of accommodations, fine dining, personalized service and exotic itineraries. Silversea Cruises delivers distinctive destination experiences by visiting unique and remote destinations, including the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica and the Arctic with cruise itineraries generally ranging from six to 25 nights.\nSilversea Cruises operates 12 ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 5,500 berths.\nOur Global Brands are complemented by our interest in TUIC, our 50%-owned joint venture that operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\").\nTUIC is a joint venture owned 50% by us and 50% by TUI AG, a German tourism company, which is designed to serve the contemporary and premium segments of the German cruise market by offering products tailored for German guests. All onboard activities, services, shore excursions and menu offerings are designed to suit the preferences of this target market.\nTUI Cruises operates seven ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 18,700 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, TUI Cruises had two ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 8,200 berths, which are expected to be delivered in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nHapag-Lloyd Cruises operates two luxury liners and three smaller expedition ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,590 berths.\nInvestments and Other Assets\nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nfor further details.\nThe cruising industry is a well-established vacation sector in the North American, European and Australian markets and a developing sector in several other emerging markets. We believe that cruising will continue to be a popular vacation choice due to its inherent value, extensive itineraries, private destinations, and variety of shipboard and shoreside activities. Industry data indicates that market penetration rates are increasing but still low and that a significant portion of cruise guests carried are first-time cruisers. Despite the increase in market penetration rates during 2024, we believe there is an opportunity for long-term growth and a potential for increased profitability.\nIndustry market penetration rates (computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population) grew from 3.36% to 3.89% for North America, from 1.25% to 1.41% for Europe, and from 0.08% to 0.20% for Asia/Pacific during the five year period from 2015 through 2019. During 2024, industry market penetration rates were 6.01% for North America, 1.72% for Europe, and 0.09% for Asia/Pacific. The penetration rates in 2024 show the growth potential in the markets most served by the industry.\nThe cruise industry was served by a fleet with a weighted average of approximately 706,000 berths during 2024 with approximately 432 ships at the end of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 50 ships on order with an estimated 116,500 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market through 2028, not taking into account ships taken out of service or ordered during these periods. The global cruise industry carried approximately 36 million guests in 2024, 32 million cruise guests in 2023 and approximately 20 million in 2022.\nThe following table details the growth in global weighted average berths and the percentage of North American, European and Asia/Pacific cruise guests for 2024, 2023, 2022 and for each of the two years prior to the 2020 suspension of global cruise operations (in millions, except berth data):\nIndustry Cruise Guests\nRoyal Caribbean Group\n___________________________________________________________________\nHistorically, we have reported annual information for comparability across periods. The 2020 suspension of global cruise operations and the gradual resumption of full operations starting in the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022 do not allow for a meaningful comparison to prior years' information and, as such, 2020 and 2021 data has been excluded from this table.\nThe estimates of the number of global cruise guests and the weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally are based on a combination of data that we obtain from various publicly available cruise industry trade information sources. We use data obtained from Seatrade Insider, Cruise Industry News and company press releases to estimate weighted-average supply of berths and CLIA and G.P. Wild to estimate cruise guest information. For 2024, we estimate the total number of global cruise guests for the full year with actual data only available through the third quarter. In addition, our estimates incorporate our own analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base.\nTotal berths include our berths related to our Global Brands and Partner Brands as of December 31, 2024.\nOur estimates include the United States and Canada.\nOur estimates include European countries relevant to the industry (most notably: the Nordics, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom).\nOur estimates include Southeast Asia (most notably: Singapore and Malaysia), East Asia (most notably: China and Japan), South Asia (most notably: India) and Oceania (most notably: Australia and New Zealand) regions. The decrease in Asia/Pacific cruise guests from 2019 to 2024 is partly driven by lack of cruise supply and itineraries in China through the first half 2023.\nWe compete with a number of cruise lines as well as land-based vacation alternatives for consumers’ leisure time. These include resorts (including all-inclusive resorts), hotels, internet-based alternative lodging sites, theme parks, sports, nature and sightseeing destinations. Our principal cruise competitors are Carnival Corporation & plc, which owns, among other brands, Aida Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn; Disney Cruise Line; MSC Cruises; Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, which owns Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises; Viking, and Virgin Voyages.\nOperating Strategies\nOur mission is to deliver the best vacation experiences responsi",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is organized to present the following:\na review of our critical accounting policies and estimates and of our financial presentation, including discussion of certain operational and financial metrics we utilize to assist us in managing our business;\na discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023; and\na discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, including our future capital and material cash requirements and potential funding sources.\nA discussion of our results of operations, and sources and uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 is included in Part II. Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). (Refer to Note 1\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n). Certain of our accounting policies are deemed \"critical,\" as they require management's highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. We have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. We believe our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows:\nShips represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 10%-15% projected residual value, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally 30-35 years. The 30-35 year useful life and 10%-15% residual value is the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. Our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, environmental regulations, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. We employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems. However, we estimate the costs, useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives, as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry. We do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems, but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements' estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized within\nCruise operating expenses\nin our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nWe periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships the planned level of improvements to maintain, enhance, and to comply with environmental regulations for vessels within those classes. In the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed.\nWe use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel's age as required by Class. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification. Class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. The activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. The significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast tanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. We perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain Class. The costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel's designed and intended operating capability. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred.\nWe use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs. If the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss on disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place. We also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred.\nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes. However, should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower. If circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship\nimprovements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year, depreciation expense for 2024 would have increased by approximately $166 million. If our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for 2024 would have increased by approximately $452 million. We have evaluated our estimated ship useful lives and projected residual values in light of our current environment and determined that there are no changes to these estimates. Refer to Note 6\n. Property and Equipment\nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nfor further information on our ships\nValuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, and if necessary, a goodwill impairment test. Factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nThe goodwill impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. We typically estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. The estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues, operating costs, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, interest rates, and assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry's competitive environment and general economic and business conditions, among other factors. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2024 impairment assessment consisted of:\nForecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day;\nOccupancy rates from existing vessels;\nVessel operating expenses;\nTerminal growth rate; and\nWeighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).\nThe discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base. We discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weighted average cost of capital.\nIf the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no write-down of goodwill is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets, an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit. Refer to Note 4\nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nfor further information on goodwill.\nThe impairment review for indefinite-lived intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment. The quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these assets using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset, such as the relief-from-royalty method, for trademarks and trade names. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2024 impairment assessment consisted of:\nForecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day;\nOccupancy rates from existing vessels;\nTerminal growth rate;\nWeighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).\nIf the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired. Other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 5.\nour consolidated financial statements under Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nfor further information on indefinite-life and finite-life intangible assets.\nWe review our ships and other long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on recent and projected cash flow performance and remaining useful lives, that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships. If estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value. Refer to Note 6\n. Property and Equipment\nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nfor further information on determination of fair value for long-lived assets.\nWe estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If active markets are not available, we base fair value on independent appraisals, sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk. Quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinite-life intangible assets. Accordingly, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite-life intangible asset using an expected present value technique.\nRoyal Caribbean Reporting Unit\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a qualitative analysis as part of our annual impairment review of the Royal Caribbean reporting unit. Based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the Royal Caribbean reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus, we did not proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit's fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative analysis as part of our annual impairment review of the Royal Caribbean reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the quantitative test, we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 100%, resulting in no impairment to Royal Caribbean's goodwill.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our Royal Caribbean reporting unit was $296 million.\nWe did not perform interim impairment evaluations of Royal Caribbean's goodwill during\nand 2023, as no triggering events were identified.\nSilversea Cruises Reporting Unit\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2023, we performed a quantitative analysis as part of our annual impairment review of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit. As of November 30, 2024, and November 30, 2023, the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit was determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the tests, we determined the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 63%, as of November 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill attributable to our Silversea Cruises reporting unit was $509 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2023, we performed our annual impairment reviews of the Silversea Cruises trade name. As a result of the quantitative tests, we determined that the fair value of the Silversea Cruises' trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 66% and 62%, as of November 30, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively,",
