Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nFor purposes of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) section, we use the terms “Hewlett Packard Enterprise”, “HPE”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” to refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company.\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist the reader in understanding our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in certain key items in these financial statements from period-to-period and the primary factors that accounted for these changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies, and estimates affect our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.\nThe financial discussion and analysis in the following MD&A compares the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 to the comparable prior-year period and where appropriate, as of July 31, 2025, unless otherwise noted.\nThis MD&A is organized as follows:\nTrends and Uncertainties.\nA discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management, such as the mixed macroeconomic environment and heightening global trade restrictions, uneven demand across our portfolio, increased demand for and adoption of new technologies, increased inventory levels, conservative customer spending environment (though recovering), persistent inflation, foreign exchange pressures, recent tax developments, and competitive pricing pressures.\nA discussion of our business and a summary of our financial performance and other highlights, including non-GAAP financial measures, affecting the Company in order to provide context to the remainder of the MD&A.\nResults of Operations.\nA discussion of the results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a discussion of the results of operations at the segment level.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\nA discussion of accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\nAn analysis of changes in our cash flows, financial condition, liquidity, and cash requirements and commitments.\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations\n. Each non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This section also includes a discussion of the use, usefulness and economic substance of the non-GAAP financial measures, along with a discussion of material limitations, and compensation for those limitations, associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nTRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nDuring the first nine months of fiscal 2025, the effects of the evolving macroeconomic environment on demand persisted and certain significant developments impacted our operations, as follows:\nTechnological Advancements:\nWe have observed market trends and demand (of customers of various segments and sizes) gravitating towards artificial intelligence (“AI”), hybrid cloud, edge computing, data security capabilities, and related offerings. The volume of data at the edge continues to grow, driven by the proliferation of more devices. The need for a unified cloud experience everywhere has grown, as well, in order to manage the growth of data at the edge. Increasing demand for AI is also contributing to changes in the competitive landscape. With the abundance of data, there are opportunities to develop AI tools with powerful computational abilities to extract insights and value from the captured data. Secure networking that is purpose-built for AI workloads is the foundation that enables users to seamlessly connect and apply AI learnings to such data that lives in various ecosystems. While we believe our recent acquisition of Juniper Networks, Inc. positions us to capitalize on the growing market opportunities across AI-accelerated computing, data, and networking, our major competitors and emerging competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions and exerting increased competitive pressure. We expect these market dynamics and trends to continue in the longer term.\nMacroeconomic Uncertainty:\nThe evolving macroeconomic environment has impacted industry-wide demand, as, until recently, customers took longer to work through prior orders and, to this day, have been adopting a more strategic approach to discretionary IT spending. While this dynamic has been easing, this has resulted in uneven demand across our portfolio and geographies, particularly for certain of our hardware offerings, as customers have focused investments on modernizing infrastructure, such as migrating to cloud-based offerings, including our own. Additionally, there continues to be significant uncertainty surrounding the tariff environment and import/export regulations due to numerous factors, including but not limited to tariff imposition delays, changes to tariff rates and policies, and enactment of reciprocally restrictive trade policies and measures. These have enhanced global trade uncertainty and contributed to higher prices of components and end products and services. While we have relied on our global supply chain and pricing measures in an attempt to mitigate adverse impacts, we expect such a mixed macroeconomic environment to largely continue and possibly limit revenue and margin growth in the near term.\nWe experienced supply chain constraints for certain components, including graphics processing units, (“GPUs”) and accelerated processing units. Though they have since eased, in part due to increased availability of supply and lower material and logistics costs, the future remains uncertain due to continuous shifts in U.S. trade policy, which has thus far impacted our ability to import and export components and finished products and the costs of doing so. Additionally, logistics costs may rise with the aforementioned changes in trade policies. We have been experiencing higher-than-normal inventory levels, primarily due to frequent component part updates, customers transitioning to the next generation of GPUs, our securing supply ahead of demand, and longer customer acceptance timelines on AI-related orders. While we have been working to reduce inventory, any or all of the aforementioned factors could contribute to sustained higher-than-normal levels and further uncertainty. We have experienced, and expect to continue experiencing, rising input component costs due to the global trade uncertainties referenced above and a competitive pricing environment, all of which may impact our financial results. We plan to mitigate the impact of these dynamics through continued disciplined cost and pricing management and supply chain diversification.\nRecurring Revenue and Consumption Models:\nWe continue to strengthen our core server and storage-oriented offerings and expand our offerings on the HPE GreenLake cloud, to deliver our entire portfolio as-a-service (“aaS”) and become the edge-to-cloud company for our customers and partners. We expect that such flexible consumption model will continue to strengthen our customer relationships and contribute to growth in recurring revenue.\nForeign Currency Exposure\n: We have a large global presence, with more than half of our revenue generated outside of the U.S. As a result, our financial results can be, and particularly in recent periods have been, impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize a comprehensive hedging strategy intended to mitigate the impact of foreign currency volatility over time, and we adjust pricing when possible to further minimize foreign currency impacts.\n: We have a number of engagements with various public sector entities, including the U.S. federal government and its agencies, as direct or indirect customers of our IT services and hardware. Significant staffing and resource reductions at certain public sector entities create an uncertain environment and as a result, our financial results may be impacted in the near term.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nRecent Tax Developments:\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. To date, 60 countries have enacted portions, or all, of the OECD proposal and a further 5 countries have drafted, or have announced an intent to draft, legislation enacting the proposed rules. Where enacted, the rules are effective for us in fiscal 2025. Under US GAAP, the OECD Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of the future minimum tax. The adoption and effective dates of these rules may vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. We do not expect a material impact to our fiscal 2025 results.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is conducting audits of our fiscal 2020 through 2022 U.S. federal income tax returns. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report regarding the audit of our fiscal 2017 through 2019 U.S. federal income tax returns with which we agreed"
