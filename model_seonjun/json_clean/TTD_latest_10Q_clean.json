Our platform empowers ad buyers to create, manage and optimize digital advertising campaigns across ad formats, channels and devices. Our platform’s depth, AI capabilities and rich ecosystem of inventory, publisher and data partner integrations enable superior reach and decisioning for clients. In addition to the primary capabilities provided by our self-service platform, our enterprise APIs equip our clients with the ability to customize and expand platform functionality.\nSince our founding in 2009, we have been committed to building a more transparent and objective advertising ecosystem and enabling more expressive and data-driven campaigns through pioneering technology innovations.\nOur clients are advertising agencies, advertisers and other service providers for agencies or advertisers, with whom we enter into ongoing MSAs. We generate revenue by charging our clients a platform fee generally based on a percentage of our clients’ total spend on our platform and from providing value-added services and data to support their advertising campaigns.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nTrends, Opportunities and Challenges\nSince our founding, we have focused on developing the most sophisticated, rich and objective platform for buyers of advertising. The growing digitization of media, fragmentation of audiences and ongoing lack of transparency in the advertising technology ecosystem have increased the complexity of advertising and thereby increased the need for an ad buying platform that users can trust. Our platform delivers valuable insights and results to clients without the conflict of interest and lack of objectivity that come with also selling advertising inventory. We believe our continued success relies on further developing our platform’s programmatic capabilities while expanding access to advertising inventory, value-added services and data to support our clients’ advertising campaigns.\nWe believe that our key opportunities include (i) our ongoing global expansion, (ii) continuing development of our omnichannel ad inventory (including in channels such as CTV and other video, mobile, audio and others), (iii) continuing development, optimization and adoption of the data usage, measurement and targeting capabilities provided by our platform, which create a natural flywheel in our business, (iv) the adoption and utilization of third-party data, in particular, retail data, and first-party data by our clients, and (v) the continuing development and incorporation of AI in our platform and related offerings.\nWe believe that growth of the programmatic advertising market is important for our ability to grow our business. Adoption of programmatic advertising by advertisers allows us to acquire new clients and grow revenue from existing clients. Although our clients include some of the largest advertising agencies and advertisers in the world, we believe there is significant room for us to expand our business relationships with these clients to gain a larger portion of their advertising spend through our platform. We also believe that the industry trends noted above will lead to advertisers adopting programmatic advertising through platforms such as ours.\nAccordingly, we see a significant market opportunity across advertisers and agencies with which we do not yet do business.\nSimilarly, the adoption of programmatic advertising by inventory owners and content providers allows us to expand the volume and type of advertising inventory we present to our clients. For example, we have expanded our CTV, audio and other advertising offerings through our integrations with supply-side partners and publishers.\nWe invest for long-term growth. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we invest in platform operations for our hosting capabilities as well as technology and development to enhance our platform and related offerings, including our continued focus on the development and incorporation of AI. We also anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase to acquire new clients and reinforce our relationships with existing clients. In addition, we expect to continue making investments in our infrastructure, including our information technology, financial and administrative systems and controls to support our growing operations.\nWe believe the markets outside of the United States, and in particular across Europe and Asia in markets such as the U.K, Germany, France, China, Japan, India and Australia, offer opportunities for growth. We intend to make additional investments in sales and marketing and product development to expand in international markets where we are making significant investments in our platform and growing our team.\nWe believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may negatively impact profitability in the near term.\nOur business model has allowed us to grow significantly, and we believe that our operating leverage enables us to support future long-term growth profitably.\nMacroeconomic Uncertainty\nChanges in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, trade policies and practices and other geopolitical developments have resulted, and may continue to result, in a global slowdown of economic activity, which may decrease demand for a broad variety of goods and services in various industries, including those provided by our clients, while also disrupting supply channels, sales channels and advertising and marketing activities for an unknown period of time until economic activity normalizes. As a result of the current uncertainty in economic activity, we are unable to predict the size and duration of the impact on our revenue and our results of operations. The extent of the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, and the duration and extent of geopolitical and global economic disruption and their respective impacts on our clients, partners, industry and employees, all of which are uncertain at this time and cannot be accurately predicted. See “\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n” in Part II. Other Information for further discussion of the adverse impacts of macroeconomic uncertainty on our business.\nResults of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared with the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nThe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nTechnology and development\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal operating expenses\nIncome from operations\nOther expense (income):\nTotal other income, net\nIncome before income taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nTechnology and development\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal operating expenses\nIncome from operations\nOther expense (income):\nTotal other income, net\nIncome before income taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nNote: Percentages may not sum due to rounding.\nRevenue increased by $111 million, or 18%, and $346 million, or 20%\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher gross spend in the current year on our platform, which was primarily driven by higher spend per advertising campaign and new clients. The increase in revenue was also due to changes in the mix of value-added services and data utilized by clients for their campaigns, which fluctuates from period to period.\nPlatform operations expense increased by $39 million, or 32%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases of $36 million in hosting costs and $3 million in personnel costs. The increase in hosting costs was primarily attributable to support costs relating to the increased use of our platform by our clients, increased use of features by our technical teams in support of our platform and investment in new data centers to support the continued growth of our platform. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to headcount growth.\nPlatform operations expense increased by $119 million, or 35%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases of $99 million in hosting costs and $16 million in personnel costs, which included a $6 million increase in stock-based compensation. The increase in hosting costs was primarily attributable to support costs relating to the increased use of our platform by our clients, increased use of features by our technical teams in support of our platform and investment in new data centers to support the continued growth of our platform. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to headcount growth as well as the increase in stock-based compensation driven by new equity awards and the impact of stock price volatility on our ESPP.\nWe expect platform operations expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to experience increased volumes of media impressions through our platform, invest in our hosting capabilities, including to support new technical features and functionality of our platform and related offerings, such as AI, and hire additional personnel to support our growth.\nSales and marketing expense increased by $17 million, or 12%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases of $13 million in personnel costs, which included a $3 million increase in stock-based compensation and $3 million in marketing costs. The increase in personnel costs was p"
