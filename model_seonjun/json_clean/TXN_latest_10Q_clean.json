Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share over the long term.\nOur strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\nA great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:\nA strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.\nA broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.\nThe reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\nDiversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments.\nTogether, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.\nDiscipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities, invest in manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.\nEfficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\nMarket and business characteristics\nMarkets for our products\nThe “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. Semiconductor cycles are affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.\nOur revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters.\nWe invest to make manufacturing and technology a core competitive advantage. The strategic decision to own our manufacturing, process and packaging technology provides us with tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain and provides our customers with geopolitically dependable capacity. We own and operate both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. We have focused on creating a competitive structural cost advantage by investing in our 300mm wafer production, which describes the diameter of the wafer on which our chips are produced, and costs about 40% less than a chip built on a 200mm wafer. In addition, we selectively use capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries and subcontractors.\nWe continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity plan. We are now mostly through a six-year elevated capital expenditures cycle that, when completed, will uniquely position TI to deliver dependable, low-cost 300mm capacity, scalability of capital expenditures, including capacity modularity, and free cash flow per share growth across a range of market conditions.\nWith our planned capacity expansions to support demand over time, we expect our internal sourcing to continue to increase. As our Lehi, Utah, manufacturing facility is in the early ramping stages, Embedded Processing is disproportionately impacted by costs associated with the site’s capacity expansion. We expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth.\nIn 2020, we announced a multi-year plan to close our two remaining factories with 150mm production, which are more than 50 years old and located in Sherman and Dallas, Texas. Production is transitioning from these sites to our more advanced and cost-effective 300mm wafer fabrication facilities.\nOur objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service, maintain dependable and competitive lead times, minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand, our strategy is to build ahead of demand our broad-based products that are used across a diverse set of applications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence. Inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and seasonality. We adjust factory loadings as needed to execute on this inventory strategy.\nResults of operations\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:\nOur segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.\nWhen we discuss our results:\nUnless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.\nNew products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.\nFrom time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped.\nBecause we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase.\nFor an explanation of free cash flow, see the Non-GAAP financial information section.\nAll dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.\nOur third quarter revenue was $4.74 billion, net income was $1.36 billion and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.48.\nRevenue increased 7% sequentially and 14% from the same quarter a year ago with growth across all end markets.\nOur cash flow from operations of $6.9 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model, the quality of our product portfolio and the benefit of 300mm production. Free cash flow for the same period was $2.4 billion.\nOver the past 12 months we invested $3.9 billion in R&D and SG&A, invested $4.8 billion in capital expenditures and returned $6.6 billion to shareholders.\nMacroeconomic factors\nWe believe trade dynamics and geopolitics are disrupting and reshaping global supply chains and affecting customer order behavior. Our global manufacturing capabilities enable us to support our customers’ needs.\nThe overall semiconductor market recovery is continuing, though at a slower pace than prior upturns, likely related to broader macroeconomic dynamics and overall uncertainty.\nU.S. legislative update\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. government enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The OBBBA provides changes to U.S. federal tax law, including expensing of U.S. research expenditures and eligible capital expenditures, increasing the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS Act) investment tax credit (ITC) and changing other tax provisions. The effect of the new law results in a higher effective tax rate in the third quarter and full year 2025. For 2026 and beyond, we expect the effective tax rate to be lower than it would have been under prior tax law. Additionally, we expect tax-related cash payments to be lower for the next several years as a result of the changes.\nDetails of financial results – third quarter 2025 compared with third quarter 2024\nRevenue of $4.74 billion increased $591 million, or 14%, due to higher revenue from increased demand in our Analog segment and, to a lesser extent, in our Embedded Processing segment, which were both impacted by the macroeconomic factors discussed above.\nGross profit of $2.72 billion was up $249 million, or 10%, due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs associated with our planned capacity expansions. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 57.4% from 59.6%.\nOpe"
