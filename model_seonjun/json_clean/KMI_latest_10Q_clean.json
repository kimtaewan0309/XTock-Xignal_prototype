Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGeneral and Basis of Presentation\nInformation Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe following acquisition was made during the 2025 period. See Note 2. “Acquisitions and Divestiture” to our consolidated financial statements for further information on this transaction.\nOutrigger Energy acquisition\nNatural gas gathering and processing system in North Dakota from Outrigger Energy II LLC which includes a 0.27 Bcf/d processing facility and a 104-mile, large-diameter, high-pressure rich gas gathering header pipeline with 0.35 Bcf/d of capacity connecting supplies from the Williston Basin area to high-demand markets.\nNatural Gas Pipelines\n2025 Dividends and Discretionary Capital\nWe expect to declare dividends of $1.17 per share for 2025, a 2% increase from the 2024 declared dividends of $1.15 per share. W\ne expect to invest $3.0 billion in e\nxpansion projects, acquisitions, and contributions to joint ventures during 2025.\nThe expectations for 2025 discussed above involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and are not guarantees of performance. Many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict, and because of these uncertainties, it is advisable not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.\nResults of Operations\nAs described in further detail below, our management evaluates our performance primarily using Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. an\nd Segment earnings before DD&A expenses (EBDA) (as presente\nd in Note 7 “Reportable Segments”), along with the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stock,\nthe aggregate and per share, Adjusted Segment EBDA, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc., Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, DD&A expenses and amortization of basis differences related to our joint ventures (previously known as amortization of excess cost of equity investments) (EBITDA), and Net Debt.\nEffective January 1, 2025, amortization of basis differences related to our joint ventures (previously known as amortization of excess cost of equity investments) is included within “Earnings from equity investments” in our accompanying consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and therefore is included within Segment EBDA. As a result, Segment EBDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation in the following MD&A tables. The adjustments were not material.\nGAAP Financial Measures\nOur Consolidated Earnings Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 present Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc., as prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and Segment EBDA, which is disclosed in Note 7 “Reportable Segments” pursuant to FASB ASC 280. The composition of Segment EBDA is not addressed nor prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles. Segment EBDA is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before DD&A and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers, such as general and administrative expenses and corporate charges, interest expense, net, and income taxes. Our general and administrative expenses and corporate charges include such items as\nunallocated employee benefits, insurance, rentals, unallocated litigation and environmental expenses, and shared corporate services including accounting, information technology, human resources, and legal services.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur non-GAAP financial measures described below should not be considered alternatives to GAAP Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. or other GAAP measures and have important limitations as analytical tools. Our computations of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. You should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Management compensates for the limitations of our consolidated non-GAAP financial measures by reviewing our comparable GAAP measures identified in the descriptions of consolidated non-GAAP measures below, understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision-making processes.\nCertain Items, as adjustments used to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures, are items that are required by GAAP to be reflected in Net income attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc., but typically either (i) do not have a cash impact (for example, unsettled commodity hedges and asset impairments), or (ii) by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in most cases are likely to occur only sporadically (for example, certain legal settlements, enactment of new tax legislation, and casualty losses). (See the tables included in “\n—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc.,\n—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Common Stock,\n—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Kinder Morgan, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA\n\nVariable rate debt(a)\nNotional principal amount of fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements\nNotional principal amount of variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements(b)\nDebt balances subject to variable interest rates\nIncludes $568 million and $331 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, of commercial paper notes.\nConsist of interest rate swap agreements set to expire December 2025.\nOur board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.2925 per share for the third quarter of 2025, a 2% increase over the dividend declared for the third quarter of 2024.\nIn February 2025 and June 2025, Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively, upgraded our rating outlook to positive. In August 2025, Fitch Ratings, Inc. upgraded our senior unsecured rating from BBB to BBB+.\nShort-term Liquidity\nAs of September 30, 2025, our principal sources of short-term liquidity are (i) cash from operations; and (ii) our $3.5 billion credit facility with an available capacity of approximately $2.9 billion and an associated $3.5 billion commercial paper program. The loan commitments under our credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program. Commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit reduce borrowings allowed under our credit facility. We provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility and, as previously discussed, have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations.\nAs of September 30, 2025, our $1,081 million of short-term debt consisted primarily of commercial paper borrowings and senior notes that mature in the next twelve months. We intend to fund our debt as it becomes due, primarily through credit facility borrowings, commercial paper borrowings, cash flows from operations and/or issuing new long-term debt. Our short-term debt as of December 31, 2024 was $2,009 million.\nWe had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) deficits of $1,420 million and $2,580 million as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The overall $1,160 million favorable change from year-end 2024 was primarily due to (i) a $1,125 million decrease in senior notes that mature in the next twelve months resulting from $1,500 million of senior notes that matured in June 2025; and (ii) a $181 million decrease in accrued interest, partially offset by a $237 million increase in commercial paper borrowings partly used to fund our Outrigger Energy acquisition. Generally, our working capital varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments, timing differences in the collection and\npayment of receivables and payables, the change in fair value of our derivative contracts, and changes in our cash and cash equivalents as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe account for our capital expenditures in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, we distinguish between capital expenditures as follows:\nPhysical Determination of Expenditure\nSustaining capital expenditures\nInvestments to maintain the operational integrity and extend the useful life of our assets\nExpansion capital expenditures (discretionary capital expenditures)\nInvestments to expand throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the making or acquisition of additions or improvements\nBudgeting of maintenance capital expenditures, which we refer to as sustaining capital expenditures, is done annually on a bottom-up basis. For each of our assets, we budget for and make those sustaining capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations, meet customer needs, and comply with our operating policies and applicable law. We may budget for and make additional sustaining capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency and/or lowering future expenses. Budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures generally occurs periodically throughout the year on a project-by-project basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures. Assets comprising expansion capital projects could result in additional s"
