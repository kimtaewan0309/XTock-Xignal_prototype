On an organic basis, revenue per requisition was up 3.0% in the quarter versus the prior year period driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per requisition and test mix.\nDS revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025 decreased by 1.0% compared to the prior year period principally due to lower revenues associated with our risk assessment services offered to insurers.\n\nDiagnostic Information Services\nQuest Diagnostics works across the healthcare ecosystem to create a healthier world, one life at a time. Our diagnostic information services (\"DIS\") business provides diagnostic insights from the results of our laboratory testing to empower people, physicians, and organizations to take action to improve health outcomes. Derived from one of the world's largest databases of de-identifiable clinical lab results, our diagnostic insights reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management. In the right hands and with the right context, our diagnostic insights can inspire actions that transform lives and create a healthier world. We provide services to a broad range of customers within our primary customer channels - physicians (including those associated with accountable care organizations and Federally Qualified Health Centers), hospitals, and patients and consumers. Our other customers include health plans, employers, emerging retail healthcare providers, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial clinical laboratories. We offer broad access to clinical testing through a nationwide network of laboratories, patient service centers, phlebotomists in physician offices, and our connectivity resources, including call centers and mobile phlebotomists, nurses and other health and wellness professionals. Our large in-house staff of medical and scientific experts, including medical directors, scientific directors, genetic counselors and board-certified geneticists, provide medical and scientific consultation to healthcare providers and patients regarding our tests and test results, and help them best utilize our services to improve outcomes and enhance satisfaction. Our DIS business makes up greater than 97% of our consolidated net revenues.\nWe assess our revenue performance for our DIS business based upon, among other factors, volume (measured by test requisitions) and revenue per requisition. Each test requisition accompanies patient specimens, indicating the test(s) to be performed and the party to be billed for the test(s). Revenue per requisition is impacted by various factors, including, among other items, the impact of fee schedule changes (i.e., unit price), test mix, payer mix, business mix and the number of tests per requisition. Management uses number of requisitions and revenue per requisition data to assist with assessing the growth and performance of the business, including understanding trends affecting number of requisitions, pricing and test mix. Therefore, we believe that information related to changes in these metrics from period to period are useful information for investors as it allows them to assess the performance of the business.\nDiagnostic Solutions\nOur diagnostic solutions (\"DS\") group, which represents the balance of our consolidated net revenues, includes our risk assessment services business, which offers solutions for insurers, and our healthcare information technology businesses, which offer solutions for healthcare providers and payers.\n\nResults for the three months ended September 30, 2025 were affected by certain items that on a net basis decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.44 as follows:\npre-tax amortization expense of $39 million recorded in amortization of intangible assets, or $0.25 per diluted share;\npre-tax charges of $22 million, recorded in other operating expense, net, or $0.15 per diluted share, comprised of a $15 million charge to earnings related to legal matters, a $5 million impairment charge on certain long-lived assets related to the exit of a business and, to a lesser extent, losses associated with the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with previous acquisitions;
