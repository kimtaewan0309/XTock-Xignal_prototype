We closely monitor attrition trends focusing on the metric that we believe is most relevant to our business. For the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2025, our Voluntary Attrition - Tech Services was 14.5% as compared to 14.6% for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024. We finished the third quarter of 2025 with approximately 349,800 employees as compared to 340,100 employees at the end of the third quarter of 2024.\nIn July 2025, the OBBBA was enacted in the United States, which, among other provisions, repealed the requirement to capitalize U.S. R&E costs. As a result, we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax asset of $390 million related to R&E costs capitalized outside the United States. These amounts would have otherwise been available to offset certain future U.S. taxes on our non-U.S. earnings, which, as a result of this repeal, we no longer project to be applicable to us. Therefore, in the third quarter of 2025, we recorded a one-time, non-cash income tax expense of $390 million. This impacted our GAAP diluted EPS by $0.80, which is added back for the calculation of Adjusted EPS. Other than this impact, we do not expect the OBBBA to significantly impact our effective income tax rate. Additionally, as a result of this repeal, our cash taxes during the third quarter of 2025 were reduced by approximately $150 million as compared to our initial cash tax projections prior to the repeal. An additional reduction of $50 million in cash taxes as compared to our initial cash tax projections prior to the repeal is expected during the fourth quarter of 2025. These assessments are based upon our current interpretation of the OBBBA, which may change as a result of future clarifications or guidance.\nWe continue to expect our clients' focus to be on their transformation into AI-ready, technology-driven, data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses\nTo support this transformation and drive greater business resiliency, clients have demanded and may increasingly\ndemand services and solutions that deliver productivity and cost savings.\nWe believe clients will continue to contend with industry-specific changes driven by evolving digital technologies, uncertainty in the regulatory environment, industry consolidation and convergence as well as international trade policie\ns, including tariffs, and other macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. This includes the uncertainty related to the global economy, which has affected and may continue to affect their demand for our services and discretionary work.\nWe increasingly use AI-based technologies, including GenAI, in our client offerings and our own internal operations. AI technologies and services are part of a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We plan to continue to make significant investments in our AI capabilities to meet the needs of our clients and harness AI's value in a flexible, secure, scalable and responsible way. As AI-based technologies or other forms of automation evolve, demand for some services that we currently perform for our clients may be reduced, and our ability to obtain favorable pricing or other terms for some of our services may be diminished.\nCognizant Technology Solutions\n\nCost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense)\n$270M\n0.5% as a % of revenues\nOur cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, project-related immigration and travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and costs of third-party products and services relating to revenues. The increase, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily driven by the impact of the resale of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy and the dilutive impact of the recently completed acquisition of Belcan, partially offset by operational efficiencies and the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements.\nSG&A Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense)\nSG&A expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, immigration, travel, marketing, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. The decrease, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily driven by net savings generated from our NextGen program.\n1.1% as a % of revenues\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by 4.7% and decreased 0.1% as a percentage of revenues during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024. The increase was driven by amortization expense from intangible assets related to our recently completed acquisition of Belcan.\nOperating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin\nOur GAAP and Adjusted Operating Margins\nfor the quarter ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were positively impacted by net savings generated from our NextGen program, operational efficiencies and the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements, partially offset by the dilutive impact of the recently completed acquisition of Belcan. In addition, our GAAP operating margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted by NextGen charges, which were excluded from our Adjusted Operating Margin.\nA predominant portion of our costs in India are denominated in the Indian rupee, representing approximately 23% of our global operating costs during the three months ended September 30, 2025. These costs are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which have an impact on our results of operations. We enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. Net of the impact of the hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee positively impacted our operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2025 by 40 basis points as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nExcluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar positively impacted our operating margin by 70 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2025. Each additional 1.0% change in exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by 18 basis points (excluding the impact of the hedges).\n\nSegment Operating Profit\nIn the first quarter of 2025, we made certain changes to the internal measurement of segment operating profit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance and resource allocation. The primary reason for the change was to reflect a more complete cost of delivery. Specifically, segment operating profit now includes an allocation of corporate costs, which were previously included in \"unallocated costs.\" We have reported 2025 segment operating profits using the new allocation methodology and have recast the 2024 results to conform to the new methodology.\nSegment operating profit and operating margin percentage were as follows:\nSegment operating profit\nSegment operating margin\nIn the third quarter of 2025, segment operating margins across all our segments were positively impacted by net savings generated from our NextGen program, operational efficiencies and the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Health Sciences segment operating profit in the third quarter of 2025 was positively impacted by reduced resales of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy. Financial Services segment operating profit in the third quarter of 2025 was negatively impacted by higher costs typical to the initial phases of several recently won large deals. Products and Resources segment operating profit in the third quarter of 2025 was negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of the Belcan acquisition and by resales of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy.\nTotal segment operating profit and operating margin were as follows for the three months ended September 30:\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal segment operating profit\nLess: unallocated costs\nIncome from operations\nThe decrease in unallocated costs for three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the absence of NextGen charges in 2025.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table sets forth total other income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30:\nForeign currency exchange (losses)\nGains on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments\nForeign currency exchange gains (losses), net\nTotal other income (expense), net\nThe foreign currency exchange losses were attributed to the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries.\nThe gains on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments related to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on contracts entered into to offset our foreign currency exposures. As of September 30, 2025, the notional value of our undesignated hedges was $770 million. Interest income declined for the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily driven by lower yields as compared\nCognizant Technology Solutions\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nPortions of our disclosure include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not"
