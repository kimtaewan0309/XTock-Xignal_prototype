Department of Commerce\n, which modified the regulatory interpretation standard established 40 years ago by\nChevron v. National Resources Defense Council\ndoctrine generally required courts to defer to federal agencies in their interpretation of federal statutes when a statute was silent or ambiguous with respect to a specific issue. In\n, the Supreme Court held that courts are no longer required to grant such deference, though they may consider an agency’s statutory interpretation. As it is highly regulated, the health care industry could be significantly impacted by the\ndecision, particularly in the areas of Medicare reimbursement, decision making by the Food & Drug Administration and health care fraud and abuse compliance, where parties may no longer be able to rely on federal agencies’ policies, rules and guidance;\nour ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same;\nthe impact of a shift of care from inpatient to lower cost outpatient settings and controls designed to reduce inpatient services;\nthe outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, inquiries, false claims act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters, and the effects of adverse publicity relating to such matters, as disclosed in\nNote 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies,\nincluding, but not limited to, the jury verdict returned against Cumberland Hospital for Children and Adolescents located in New Kent, Virginia, an indirect subsidiary of ours, and the verdict in the Pinnacle litigation in Washoe County, Nevada, against certain subsidiaries of ours;\neffective March, 2025, our excess commercial insurance coverage for professional and general liability claims contains less favorable terms than previous years including coverage exclusions for incidents involving sexual molestation or abuse, higher premiums and lower aggregate limitations;\ncompetition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets;\ntechnological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;\nour ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor and related expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals;\ndemographic changes;\nthere is a heightened risk of future cybersecurity threats, including ransomware attacks targeting healthcare providers. If successful, future cyberattacks could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any costs that we incur as a result of a data security incident or breach, including costs to update our security protocols to mitigate such an incident or breach could be significant. Any breach or failure in our operational security systems, or any third-party security systems that we rely on, can result in loss of data or an unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive or confidential member or protected personal or health information and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, significant penalties or fines, litigation, loss of customers, significant damage to our reputation and business, and other liability or losses. We may also incur additional costs related to cybersecurity risk management and remediation. There can be no assurance that we or our service providers, if applicable, will not suffer losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all the costs resulting from such events;\nthe availability of suitable acquisition and divestiture opportunities and our ability to successfully integrate and improve our acquisitions since failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits from certain of our prior or future acquisitions could result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangibles;\nthe impact of severe weather conditions, including the effects of hurricanes, flash floods, wildfires and climate change;\nour ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;\nour inpatient acute care and behavioral health care facilities may experience decreasing admission and length of stay trends;\nour financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payers and there can be no assurance that failure of the payers to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;\n\nadditional possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payers or government based payers, including Medicare or Medicaid in the United States, and government based payers in the United Kingdom;\nthe healthcare industry is labor intensive and salaries, wages and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supplies expense and other operating expenses. In the past, staffing shortages have, at times, required us to hire expensive temporary personnel and/or enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel. At certain facilities, particularly within our behavioral health care segment, there have been occasions when we were unable to fill all vacant positions and, consequently, we were required to limit patient volumes. We have also experienced general inflationary cost increases related to certain of our other operating expenses. Many of these factors, which had a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations in prior years, have moderated more recently. However, we cannot predict future inflationary increases, which if significant, could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations. We have experienced inflationary pressures, primarily in personnel costs, although those pressures have moderated more recently. The extent of any future impacts from inflation on our business and our results of operations will be dependent upon how long the elevated inflation levels persist and the extent to which the rate of inflation further increases, if at all, neither of which we are able to predict. If elevated levels of inflation were to persist or if the rate of inflation were to accelerate, our expenses could increase faster than anticipated and we may utilize our capital resources sooner than expected. Further, given the complexities of the reimbursement landscape in which we operate, our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws, which in certain circumstances, limit our ability to increase prices;\nin our acute care segment, we have experienced a significant increase in hospital based physician related expenses, especially in the areas of emergency room care, anesthesiology and radiology. We have implemented various initiatives to mitigate the increased expense, to the degree possible, which has moderated the rate of increase. However, significant increases in these physician related expenses could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations;\nthe increase in interest rates during the past few years has increased our interest expense significantly increasing our expenses and reducing our free cash flow and our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms. As such, the effects of increased borrowing rates have adversely impacted our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict future changes to interest rates, however, significant increases in our borrowing rates could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations;\nsignificant tariffs or other restrictions, if imposed on our imported pharmaceutical ingredients, medical devices, medical equipment and their ingredients and components, could escalate costs of medications, medical devices and medical equipment and disrupt our supply chains. While we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the new tariffs on our business, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of any new tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the U.S. and the impacted foreign countries, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful. Therefore, changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular, increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from where our products or materials are made (either directly or through our suppliers) could have an impact on our competitive position, business operations and financial results;\nthe Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 extended appropriations to federal agencies for continuing projects and activities through September 30, 2025. In the past several years political disputes concerning authorization of a federal budget have led to shutdown of substantial portions of the federal government and other federal budget authorization delays have occurred. Currently, the United States Congress has failed to approve a federal budget for federal fiscal year 2026 and a federal shutdown began on October 1, 2025. Federal budget delays and federal government shutdowns are unpredictable and may occur in the future. We cannot predict whether or not there will be future legislation halting a federal government shutdown, however, our operating cash flows and results of operations could be materially unfavorably impacted by the federal government shutdown;\nas part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the \"CAA\"), Congress passed legislation aimed at preventing or limiting patient balance billing in certain circumstances. The CAA addresses surprise medical bills stemming from emergency services, out-of-network ancillary providers at in-network facilities, and air ambulance carriers. The CAA prohibits surprise billing when out-of-network emergency services or out-of-network services at an in-network facility are provided, unless informed consent is received. In these circumstances providers are prohibited from billing the patient for any amounts that exceed in-network cost-sharing requirements. HHS, the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury have issued rules to implement the legislation. The rules have limited the ability of our hospital-based physicians to receive payments for services at usually higher out-of-network rates in certain circumstances, and, as a result, have caused us to increase subsidies to these physicians or to replace their services at a higher cost level;\n\nThe healthcare industry is labor intensive and salaries, wages and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supplies expense and other operating expenses. In the past, staffing shortages have, at times, required us to hire expensive temporary personnel and/or enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel.

Operating expenses incurred by our commercial health insurer, consisting primarily of medical costs, increased by $45 million, or 35.8% (due to a corresponding increase in membership), during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024. Excluding the operating costs of our commercial insurer from each period, other operating expenses increased by $49 million, or 10.4%. Contributing to the increased operating expenses during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024, was a $21 million, or 13.3%, aggregate increase in physician expenses incurred at certain hospitals. As a percentage of net revenues, other operating expenses increased to 28.6% during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to 27.8% during the comparable quarter of 2024.\nSupplies expense increased by $12 million, or 3.5%, during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the third quarter of 2024, due, in part, to an increase in patient volumes. As a percentage of net revenues, supplies expense decreased to 14.2% during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to 15.4% during the third quarter of 2024.\nNine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues from our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, increased by $580 million or 9.1%. Income before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased by $237 million, or 38%, amounting to $865 million, or 12.5% of net revenues during the first nine months of 2025, as compared to $628 million, or 9.9% of net revenues during the first nine months of 2024.\n\nOn a Same Facility basis, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $122 million, or 4.7%. Contributing to the increase in salaries, wages and benefits was an increase in our patient volumes during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the comparable period of 2024.

Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the “Joint Committee”), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. Current legislation has extended these reductions through 2032. We cannot predict whether Congress will restructure the implemented Medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress going forward;\nuninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities unfavorably impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;\nchanges in our business strategies or development plans;\nwe have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the pound sterling. We have international subsidiaries that operate in the United Kingdom. We routinely hedge our exposures to foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations, but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations. To the extent that these hedges are inadequate, our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses, and;\nGiven these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nWe receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.\nHospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control. The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis. We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.\nPatients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year. Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts.\nSources of Revenues a"
