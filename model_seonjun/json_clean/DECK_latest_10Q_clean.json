Our actual results of operations may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth in the section titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” within this Quarterly Report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global leader in designing, marketing, and distributing innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high-performance activities. We market our products primarily under five proprietary brands: HOKA, UGG, Teva, Koolaburra, and AHNU.

Independent third-party contractors manufacture all of our products.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nConsolidated financial performance highlights for the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the prior period, were as follows:\nNet sales increased 12.1% to $2,395,378.\nHOKA brand net sales increased 15.3% to $1,287,205.\nUGG brand net sales increased 12.3% to $1,024,679.\nOther brands net sales decreased 22.5% to $83,494.\nWholesale channel net sales increased 18.2% to $1,688,593.\nDTC channel net sales decreased 0.2% to $706,785.\nDomestic net sales decreased 2.1% to $1,340,788.\nInternational net sales increased 37.5% to $1,054,590.\nGross margin decreased 30 basis points to 56.0%.\nSG&A expenses increased 11.0% to $849,920.\nIncome from operations increased 12.3% to $491,808.\nOperating margin remained flat at 20.5%.\nDiluted earnings per share increased 17.1% to $2.74 per share.\nTRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nWe expect our business and industry will continue to be impacted by several important trends and uncertainties, which have not materially changed from those described in our 2025 Annual Report. Refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of our 2025 Annual Report for further discussion. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our 2025 Annual Report for detailed information on the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nREPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS OVERVIEW\nAs of September 30, 2025, our three reportable operating segments include the worldwide operations of the HOKA brand, UGG brand, and Other brands.\nThe HOKA brand is an authentic premium line of year-round performance footwear, which offers enhanced cushioning and inherent stability with minimal weight. Originally designed for ultra-runners, the brand now appeals to world champions, taste makers, and everyday athletes. Expanded marketing and strategic marketplace presence have fueled both domestic and international sales growth of the HOKA brand, which has quickly become a leading brand within run and outdoor specialty wholesale accounts and is growing across its global marketplace. The HOKA brand’s product line includes running, trail, hiking, fitness, and lifestyle footwear offerings, as well as select apparel and accessories.\nThe UGG brand is one of the most iconic and recognized footwear brands in our industry, which highlights our successful track record of building niche brands into lifestyle and fashion market leaders. With loyal consumers around the world, the UGG brand has proven to be a highly resilient consumer-focused line of premium footwear, apparel, and accessories with year-round product offerings that appeal to a growing global audience and a broad demographic.\nOther brands consist primarily of the Teva brand, Koolaburra brand, and AHNU brand. The Teva brand’s products are built for a range of outdoor pursuits and include a variety of footwear options, from classic sandals and shoes to boots.\nThe Other brands reportable operating segment includes current and historical results of the Koolaburra and AHNU brands that are being phased out for standalone operations, as well as the Sanuk brand that was previously sold. Refer to the section titled “Reportable Operating Segments,” in Note 1, “General,” of our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report, for further information.\nRefer to the section titled “Reportable Operating Segment Overview,” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of our 2025 Annual Report for further discussion of our reportable operating segments.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe disclose supplemental financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP; however, throughout this Quarterly Report we provide certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis (non-GAAP financial measures). We provide non-GAAP financial measures to provide information that may assist investors in understanding our results of operations and assessing our prospects for future performance, which consist of constant currency measures. We believe evaluating certain financial and operating measures on a constant currency basis is important as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are not indicative of our core results of operations and are largely outside of our control. However, our non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to represent and should not be considered more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of financial or operating performance as determined in accordance with US GAAP.\nWe calculate our constant currency non-GAAP financial measures for current period financial information, such as total net sales using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period, excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate hedges and remeasurements in the condensed consolidated financial statements. We also report comparable DTC sales on a constant currency basis for DTC operations that were open throughout the current and prior reporting periods, and we may adjust prior reporting periods to conform to current year accounting policies. The information presented on a constant currency basis, as we present such information, may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled information presented by other companies, and may not be appropriate measures for comparing our performance relative to other companies. Constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation as an alternative to US dollar measures that reflect current period foreign currency exchange rates or to other financial or operating measures presented in accordance with US GAAP.\nSEASONALITY\nRefer to Note 1, “General,” of our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report and to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of our 2025 Annual Report for additional information regarding the impacts of seasonality on our business.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025, Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\n. Results of operations were as follows:\n\nIncludes Sanuk brand financial results from April 1, 2024 through the Sanuk Brand Sale Date for the six months ended September 30, 2024, which are presented in the Other brands reportable operating segment.\nThe change in reportable operating segments had an impact on segment income from operations, a measure of segment profitability, and a clarification was made that certain prior unallocated overhead costs are defined as unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability.\nThe increase in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by lower gross margins. Drivers of significant net changes in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, were as follows:\nThe increase in income from operations of the HOKA brand was due to higher net sales, partially offset by lower gross margins and higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, primarily driven by payroll and related costs, rent and occupancy, and other SG&A expenses.\nThe increase in income from operations of the UGG brand was due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, primarily driven by advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses, and other SG&A expenses.\nIncome tax expense and our effective income tax rate were as follows:\nSix Months Ended September 30,\nEffective income tax rate\nThe "
