The\ncharges primarily related to the redesign of our asset management, and customer and order management software systems. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2025\nand 2024, we paid $10 million and $18 million, respectively, related to these restructuring efforts.\nDuring the remainder of 2025, we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately\nprimarily related to the design and implementation of a new accounts receivable system\n. Substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in Corporate entities and other.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we experienced labor disruptions in certain isolated markets. The impact of these labor disruptions was $56 million during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, including $16 million of customer credits and $40 million of cost of operations.\nResults of Operations\nWe generate revenue by providing environmental services to our customers, including the collection and processing of recyclable materials, the collection, treatment, consolidation, transfer and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and other environmental solutions. Our residential, small-container and large-container collection operations in some markets are based on long-term contracts with municipalities. Certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index. We generally provide small-container and large-container collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our transfer stations and landfills generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. Our recycling centers generate revenue from tipping fees charged to third parties and the sale of recycled commodities. Our revenue from environmental solutions is primarily generated by (1) fees we charge for the collection, treatment, transfer and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, (2) field and industrial services, (3) equipment rental, (4) emergency response and standby services, (5) in-plant services, such as transportation and logistics, including at our TSDFs and (6) in-plant services such as high-pressure cleaning, tank cleaning, decontamination, remediation, transportation, spill cleanup and emergency response at refineries, chemical, steel and automotive plants and other governmental, commercial and industrial facilities. Other non-core revenue consists primarily of revenue from National Accounts, which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations. The following table reflects our revenue by service line for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nEnvironmental solutions\nEnvironmental solutions, net\nRecycling processing and commodity sales\nThe following table reflects changes in components of our revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nRecycling processing and commodity sales\nEnvironmental solutions\nTotal internal growth\nAcquisitions / divestitures, net\n(1) Other represents customer credits recognized in connection with recent labor disruptions.\nAverage yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service, expressed as a percentage. Core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees, excluding fuel recovery fees, net of price decreases to retain customers. We also measure changes in core price, average yield and volume as a percentage of related-business revenue, defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities, fuel recovery fees and environmental solutions revenue, to determine the effectiveness of our pricing and organic growth strategies.\nThe following table reflects core price, average yield and volume as a percentage of related-business revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nAs a % of Related Business\nAs a % of Related Business\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to the same periods in 2024:\nAverage yield increased revenue by 4.0% and 4.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, due to positive pricing changes in all lines of business.\nThe fuel recovery fee program, which mitigates our exposure to changes in fuel prices, resulted in no change to revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to the timing of implementing changes to the rates to reflect the increase in fuel prices compared to the same period in 2024. The fuel recovery fee program decreased revenue by 0.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, due to a decrease in fuel prices compared to the same period in 2024.\nVolume decreased revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 by 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in volume in our collection lines of business as well as a decrease in solid waste volumes in our landfill line of business. The decline in revenue in our large-container collection line of business was primarily driven by a slowing in construction-related activity as well as adverse weather in January and February. The decline in our residential and small-container collection lines of business is primarily attributable to certain municipal contract losses and broker-related business.\nThe decrease in overall volume during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was partially offset by an increase in construction and demolition and special waste volumes. The increase was primarily related to Hurricane\nHelene recovery efforts and the Los Angeles area wildfire remediation. The increase in volume from these events increased revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 by approximately $100 million.\nThe impact of the number of workdays resulted in no change to revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024. Revenue decreased by 0.2% due to the impact of the number of workdays during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, which drove a decrease in volumes in our collection, landfill, and transfer lines of business.\nRecycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 0.2% during the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to a decrease in price for recycled commodities compared to the same period 2024. This decrease was largely offset by increased volumes at the Las Vegas Polymer Center, the opening of the Indianapolis Polymer Center and reopening a recycling center on the west coast. There was no change to revenue as a result of recycling processing and commodity sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024. The average price for recycled commodities at our recycling centers, excluding glass and organics, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $126 and $143 per ton, respectively, compared to $177 and $168 per ton for the same periods in 2024, respectively.\nChanging market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices. At current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a $10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately $11 million.\nEnvironmental solutions decreased revenue by 1.4% and 0.7% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, primarily due to a decline in manufacturing and emergency response activity as well as a decrease in event-based volumes into our landfills.\nAcquisitions, net of divestitures, increased revenue by 1.6% and 1.3% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, reflecting the results of our continued growth strategy of acquiring environmental services companies that complement and expand our existing business platform.\nCost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes. It also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and containers, including related labor and benefit costs; transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for independent haulers that transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators that provide waste handling services associated with our National Accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel tax credits; disposal fees and taxes, consisting of landfill taxes, host community fees and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes financial assurance, leachate disposal, remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management costs, which include insurance premiums and claims; cost of goods sold, which includes material costs paid to suppliers; and other, which includes expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations.\nThe following t"
