MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, which can be found in Part I. Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements.\nArcher-Daniels-Midland Company and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"ADM\") unlock the power of nature to enrich the quality of life. The Company is an essential global agricultural supply chain manager and processor, providing food security by connecting local needs with global capabilities. ADM is a premier human and animal nutrition provider, offering one of the industry’s broadest portfolios of ingredients and solutions from nature. The Company is a trailblazer in health and well-being, with an industry-leading range of products for consumers looking for new ways to live healthier lives. ADM is a cutting-edge innovator, guiding the way to a future of new bio-based consumer and industrial solutions. ADM is a leader in business-driven sustainability efforts that support a strong agricultural sector, resilient supply chains, and a vast and growing bioeconomy. Around the globe, the Company’s expertise and innovation are meeting critical needs from harvest to home.\nThe Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into three reportable segments: Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard\nand are classified within either Corporate or Other Business.\nSee Part I. Item 1. Note 13. Segment Information of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments.\nThe Company’s goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for its shareholders and customers. The Company established the following priorities to help achieve its goal:\nFocus on execution and cost management – ADM seeks to prioritize operational excellence and driving targeted cost reductions through: (1) boosting plant efficiencies and restoring operations at the Decatur East plant; (2) optimizing operating leverage within the Nutrition segment; and (3) reducing third party spend and selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nStrategic simplification – ADM seeks to enhance returns on invested capital by executing a pipeline of simplification opportunities to optimize our portfolio and organizational structure, including: (1) addressing performance, demand, and capacity challenges; (2) reducing capital expenditures that do not meet the Company’s return objectives; and (3) reducing capability overlaps through synergies, closures, and divestitures.\nTargeted growth investment – ADM seeks to prioritize organic investment in key strategic initiatives, while also ensuring our businesses are ready for the future, including: (1) plant modernization investments; (2) cost optimization investments; and (3) enterprise system and process enhancements.\nDeploy capital with discipline – ADM seeks to prudently invest in opportunities. The Company also expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases as appropriate.\nADM has refined its digital strategy and is pivoting away from large global implementations and directing resources to prioritize regional, more agile projects. The Company is accelerating its data journey while continuing to invest the appropriate amount in cybersecurity and network and application resilience. As a result of this strategy adaptation, during the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $173 million related to previously capitalized internal-use software. See Part I. Item 1. Note 14. Asset Impairment, Exit, and Restructuring Costs for further information.\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor more than 120 years, ADM has built its business on the strength of agriculture, innovation, and responsible stewardship. Today, sustainability is a core driver of ADM’s growth strategy, powering innovation, improving resilience, and unlocking new value across the global food system. The crops that ADM turns into an expansive array of products depend on healthy soil, water and air, and as the Company looks to the future, it is advancing efforts that enable and support agriculture and farmers, drive innovation and long-term value, and protect and strengthen vital supply chains.\nADM is reimagining agriculture by scaling regenerative practices in partnership with farmers, supporting them with tools, insights, and financial incentives to help their operations thrive. ADM is innovating to meet growing demand for sustainably sourced, bio-based products, creating new market opportunities for farmers whose crops deliver health, transparency, and environmental benefits. The Company is modernizing its own operations to improve efficiency, enhance competitiveness, reduce emissions, and build a more resilient supply chain that starts on the farm.\nSignificant Portfolio Actions and Targeted Actions to Deliver Cost Savings\nOn February 4, 2025, the Company announced targeted actions expected to deliver in excess of $500 million of cost savings by fiscal 2029. These include cost optimization and portfolio simplification initiatives designed to help the Company achieve cost efficiencies. See Note 14. Asset Impairment, Exit, and Restructuring Costs of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding restructuring related charges.\nADM’s recent significant portfolio actions and announcements included:\nThe acquisition in January 2025 of Vandamme Hugaria Kft, a 700 metric ton/day non-genetically modified crush and extraction facility based in Hungary. See Note 4. Acquisitions of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe closure of the Tres Corações facility based in Brazil, in July 2025. Preparation for the closure resulted in exit and restructuring costs, including impairment of certain assets.\nThe launch in September 2025 of a joint venture with PYCO Industries, Inc., a leader in the local agricultural communities it serves, combining its and ADM’s Lubbock, Texas, cottonseed processing capabilities.\nThe execution of a definitive agreement in September 2025 with Alltech Inc., a global leader in agriculture, to launch a North American animal feed joint venture to offer an industry-leading range of products and solutions for livestock, equine, backyard and leisure animals.\nGovernment Investigation\nAs previously disclosed, the Company had identified a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting related to its accounting practices and procedures for segment disclosures which has been remediated. For more information, see “Controls and Procedures” in Part I. Item 4 herein.\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperating Performance Indicators\nThe Company’s Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions segments are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials. As a result, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both Revenues and Cost of products sold. Therefore, margins per volume or metric ton generally are meaningful as performance indicators in these businesses.\nThe Nutrition segment also utilizes agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in Cost of products sold. Therefore, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins and margins rates generally are meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses.\nThe Company has consolidated subsidiaries in approximately 78 countries. For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except for certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency, and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. For the majority of the Company’s business activities in Brazil and Argentina, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency. Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), margins, segment operating profit, total segment operating profit, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITDA. Some of these metrics are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.
