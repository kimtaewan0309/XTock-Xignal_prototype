With this change, our client-focused growth model is bringing together all our capabilities across strategy, consulting, technology, operations, Song and Industry X, including deep industry and functional expertise across these capabilities, plus our technology ecosystem partnerships, to create more leading solutions faster and embed AI and data more easily into creating and delivering our solutions and services. As the reinvention partner of choice for our clients, we are building the digital core and helping reinvent nearly every part of the enterprise, everything from functions that are common across industries like HR and Finance, to industry-specific functions like manufacturing and capital projects. With the majority of our large deals today already involving capabilities across multiple areas, the full rollout of our model is designed to make it faster and simpler to sell and deliver everything Accenture offers across our client base, while embedding more AI and data and equipping our people.\nStrategy and Consulting\nWe work with C-suite executives, leaders and boards of the world’s leading organizations, helping them reinvent nearly every part of their enterprise to set their strategic priorities, build their digital core, reinvent processes and reimagine their workforce to drive greater growth, enhance competitiveness, and deliver sustainable 360° stakeholder value. Our deep industry and functional expertise is supported by proprietary assets and platforms that help organizations transform faster and become more resilient. Underpinned by technology, data, analytics, AI, change management, talent, learning and sustainability, these capabilities help architect and accelerate all aspects of an organization’s reinvention. Our strategists and deep industry, functional, customer and technology consultants work hand-in-hand with our clients and across our capabilities to shape and deliver these reinventions.\nWe help our clients build their digital core including AI, data, cloud, systems integration and application management, security, intelligent platform services, infrastructure services, software engineering services, automation and global delivery\nutilizing our deep industry and functional knowledge to create solutions that will drive value at speed. We continuously innovate our solutions and services and develop new capabilities, assets and platforms through early adoption of new technologies such as advanced AI, which includes generative, agentic and physical AI, robotics, 5G, edge computing and quantum computing, as well as invest in R&D for both new and existing forms of technology. We also invest in emerging technologies through Accenture Ventures.\nACCENTURE\nWe operate business processes on behalf of clients for specific enterprise functions, including finance and accounting, sourcing and procurement, supply chain, marketing and sales, and human resources, as well as industry-specific services, such as platform trust and safety, banking, insurance, network and health services. We help organizations with reinvented operations, enabled by SynOps, our proprietary AI-powered, cloud-enabled platform that empowers people with data, processes, automation and a broad ecosystem of technology partners to transform enterprise operations at speed and scale. Our experience from operations also informs our strategy and consulting capabilities to better serve our clients.\nS\nWe help our clients create new, hyper-personalized experiences and services that are intelligently designed to foster loyalty and drive growth by making customer interactions more compelling, useful, and simple from initial interaction through ongoing customer service. We also build the strong digital core that supports the customer agenda. Our suite of solutions and services spans design, digital products, marketing, sales, commerce, and customer service. We help brands amplify their value, by making their products, services and experiences clear and inspiring to stand out in a crowded marketplace. Our commerce strategies are designed to enhance sales effectiveness and create seamless buying experiences. Our customer service innovations powered with AI help make support more responsive and accessible. We leverage the power of a connected customer strategy, AI and data, ecosystem partnerships, and our ability to scale and manage programs on behalf of our clients to solve client challenges more effectively, and provide solutions that are designed to be advanced, ethically sound and sustainable to help our clients reinvent how they engage their customers and grow.\nWe combine our digital capabilities with deep engineering and manufacturing expertise. By using the combined power of digital and data we help our clients to reinvent and reimagine the products they make and how they make them. We have expanded our capabilities over the last few years to include helping our clients to digitally transform how their capital projects are planned, managed and executed, from plant and asset construction to public infrastructure, power grids and data centers. We collaborate closely with our technology ecosystem partners to help our clients achieve compressed transformations by redefining how their products are designed and engineered, tested, sourced and supplied, manufactured, and serviced, returned and renewed. Our solutions and services include the use of data and transformative technologies such as advanced AI, artificial reality/virtual reality, advanced robotics and digital twins.\nEcosystem Partner Relationships\nOur successful strategy for more than a decade has been to be the number-one partner for the technology ecosystem. As technology is front and center for every client, we are the number-one partner for all of our top 10 ecosystem partners. These partners are among the world’s largest technology companies by revenue, and they are seeking deeper partnerships with us as they look for help to turn their technology into business outcomes and scale the adoption of AI. In fiscal 2025, we expanded our partnerships beyond the top 10 in AI and data and created new ones with companies that are becoming critical to many of our clients, which also want us to help them scale their client and customer relationships.\nWe continue to be the reinvention partner of choice, serving approximately 9,000 clients including a significant portion of the Fortune Global 100 and 500. We believe our global footprint and breadth of capabilities mean we can serve more of our clients’ needs for large-scale transformations than any other player in the industry. Our deep and long-standing relationships mean we know our clients and their industries thoroughly. We have long-term relationships and have partnered with\nclients for 10 or more years, and have 305 Diamond clients, our largest client relationships.\nWe believe the depth and breadth of our industry expertise is a key competitive advantage which allows us to bring client-specific industry solutions and services to our clients to accelerate reinvention and value creation. Our industry focus gives us an understanding of industry evolution, business issues and trends, industry operating models, capabilities and processes and new and emerging technologies. The breadth of our industry expertise enables us to create solutions that are informed by cross industry experience.

  "item7_clean": "During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our Latin America market unit moved from Growth Markets to North America. With this change, North America became the Americas market and Growth Markets became the Asia Pacific market. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.\nThe following revenues commentary discusses the primary drivers of local currency revenue changes by geographic market for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024:\nAmericas revenues increased 9% in local currency, led by growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Industrials and Software & Platforms. Revenue growth was driven by the United States.\nEMEA revenues increased 6% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Life Sciences, Insurance, Health and Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom and Germany, partially offset by a decline in France.\nAsia Pacific revenues increased 4% in local currency, led by growth in Utilities, Banking & Capital Markets, Public Service and Insurance, partially offset by a decline in Chemicals & Natural Resources. Revenue growth was driven by Japan and Australia, partially offset by a decline in Singapore.\nOperating expenses for fiscal 2025 increased $4,147 million over fiscal 2024, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 85.3% from 85.2% in fiscal 2024.\nThe primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation and other payroll costs, as well as non-payroll costs such as subcontractors, facilities, technology and travel. Cost of services and the related gross margin may be impacted by several factors, including contract profitability, which includes the pricing on the work that we sell, as well as by the investments we make in our business and our people, such as research and development to build assets, platforms and industry and functional solutions, learning and professional development and strategic acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.\nACCENTURE\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOperating expenses by category are as follows:\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2025” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2025. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.\nWe use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nAccenture is a leading solutions and global professional services company that helps enterprises reinvent by building their digital core and unleashing the power of AI to create value at speed across the enterprise, bringing together our people, proprietary assets and platforms, and deep ecosystem relationships. Through our Reinvention Services we bring together our capabilities across strategy, consulting, technology, operations, Song and Industry X with our deep industry expertise to create and deliver solutions and services for our clients. We serve clients in three geographic markets: the Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific.\nOur results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment, new and rapidly changing technologies, and levels of business confidence. We continue to see significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. While the discretionary environment is unchanged, clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, which include becoming AI-ready.\nIn addition, the U.S. administration is reducing federal spending and the size of the federal workforce under the guidance of the Department of Government Efficiency. We are seeing impacts from these efforts in our federal government business (“Accenture Federal Services, or AFS”), including delays in new procurements, reductions in price and contract scope, and contract terminations. These changes have had an adverse effect on AFS’s results and could in the future have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. For a discussion of risks related to these and other recent developments, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nfiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 are included below. We have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2025 and 2024 on a non-GAAP or “adjusted” basis to exclude the impact of business optimization costs. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we initiated business optimization actions and recorded $615 million in related costs, which includes $344 million associated with a refreshed talent strategy, as well as asset impairments of approximately $271 million primarily related to the divestiture of two acquisitions that are no longer aligned with our strategic priorities. In fiscal 2024, we recorded $438 million in business optimization costs associated with actions initiated in fiscal 2023 and completed in fiscal 2024. For additional information regarding our business optimization actions and related costs, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nRevenues of $69.7 billion,\nin both U.S. dollars and local currency;\nNew bookings of $80.6 billion,\na decrease of 1% in both U.S. dollars and local currency;\nACCENTURE\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOperating margin of 14.7%,\na decrease from 14.8% in fiscal 2024; adjusted operating margin of 15.6%, an increase compared to 15.5% in fiscal 2024;\nDiluted earnings per share of $12.15,\na 6% increase over diluted earnings per share of $11.44 in fiscal 2024; adjusted earnings per share of $12.93, an 8% increase over adjusted earnings per share of $11.95 in fiscal 2024; and\nCash returned to shareholders of $8.3 billion,\nincluding dividends of $3.7 billion and share purchases of $4.6 billion.\nU.S.\n(in billions of U.S. dollars)\nEMEA\n\nAmounts in table may not total due to rounding.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our Latin America market unit moved from Growth Markets to North America. With this change, North America became the Americas market and Growth Markets became the Asia Pacific market. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.\nRevenues for fiscal 2025 increased 7% in both U.S. dollars and local currency compared to fiscal 2024. During fiscal 2025, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in the Americas, strong in EMEA and solid in Asia Pacific. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Financial Services & Products, strong in Health & Public Service and Communications, Media & Technology and solid in Resources. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in managed services and solid in consulting. While the business environment remained competitive, pricing improved in several areas of our business. We define pricing as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.\nIn our consulting business, revenues for fiscal 2025 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency compared to fiscal 2024. Consulting revenue growth in local currency for fiscal 2025 was driven by strong growth in the Americas, solid growth in EMEA and modest growth in Asia Pacific. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their reinvention, leveraging cloud, enterprise platforms, security, AI and data, including advanced AI, as well as our change capabilities to help clients build new skills and drive the successful adoption of new processes and technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings, supply chain and operational resilience, as well as to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. While we continue to experience demand for these services, we are seeing a slower pace and level of client spending, particularly for smaller contracts with a shorter duration.\nIn our managed services business, revenues for fiscal 2025 increased 9% in both U.S. dollars and local currency compared to fiscal 2024. Managed services revenue growth in local currency for fiscal 2025 was driven by very strong growth in the Americas and strong growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with reinvented operations, application development and maintenance, and infrastructure management including cloud and security. Clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through technology, AI and data, and leveraging our proprietary assets and platforms and talent to drive productivity and cost savings.\nAs we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the\nACCENTURE\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nU.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. There was minimal currency translation impact for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our fiscal 2026 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 2% higher than our revenue growth in local currency.\nconsistent with fiscal 2024\ncompared to approximately 774,000 as of August 31, 2024\ncompared to 13% in fiscal 2024\nUtilization for fiscal 2025 was 92%, consistent with fiscal 2024. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our solutions and services, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 779,000 as of August 31, 2025, compared to approximately 774,000 as of August 31, 2024.\nFor fiscal 2025, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 14%, compared to 13% in fiscal 2024. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 15%, down from 16% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand.\nIn addition, we adjust compensation to provide market relevant pay based on the skills of our people and locations where we operate. We also consider a variety of factors, including the macroeconomic environment, in making our decisions around pay and benefits. We strive to adjust pricing as well as drive cost and delivery efficiencies, such as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology, to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin and contract profitability.\nOur ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of solutions and services clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees.\nU.S.\n(in billions of U.S. dollars)\n\nWe provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large managed services contracts. The types of solutions and services clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, managed services bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.\nInformation regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nACCENTURE\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgmen",
