Uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation, determination of legally responsible parties, and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations make future environmental remediation costs difficult to estimate and can cause our estimated remediation costs to change.\nWe believe we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business. We could be affected by new or evolving environmental laws, regulations, or policies. We have made investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental legal requirements, but we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations. We do not currently believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A and Note 15: Commitments and Contingencies under Item 8 for further information regarding environmental matters.\nCompetitive Environment\nIn our business of designing, building, overhauling, and repairing military ships, we primarily compete with General Dynamics and, in the case of certain non-nuclear shipbuilding programs, smaller shipyards. The smaller shipyards sometimes team with large defense contractors. Intense competition related to programs, resources, funding, and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our shipbuilding business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general. It is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another party, become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party. It is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously serve as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts. The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding long-term contracts, enables companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries.\nWe believe we are well-positioned in our shipbuilding markets. Because we are the only company currently capable of building, refueling, and inactivating the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, we believe we are positioned well to be awarded future contracts to perform such activities. Even so, the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities. If a U.S. Government shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our market position would likely be significantly and adversely affected.\nWhile we have competed with another large defense contractor to build large deck amphibious ships, we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the U.S. Navy, including LHAs and LPDs. We are also the sole builder of NSCs for the U.S. Coast Guard. We are one of only two companies currently capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy, and we are party to long-term teaming agreements with the other company for the production of both\nclass (SSN 774) fast attack nuclear submarines and\nclass (SSBN 826) ballistic missile submarines. We are one of only two companies that builds the U.S. Navy's current fleet of\nclass (DDG 51) destroyers and are positioned well to be awarded future contracts for surface combatant ships.\nOur Mission Technologies segment competes domestically and internationally against large aerospace and defense (\"A&D\") companies, primarily L3 Harris, Amentum, ManTech, Leidos, and, increasingly, small businesses serving the intelligence community. To a lesser extent, our lines of business compete on certain contracts with major prime A&D contractors, including Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, RTX Corporation, and Boeing.\nKey competitive factors in the Mission Technologies segment include technology capabilities; innovative cyber advances and artificial intelligence; the ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; the ability to meet delivery schedules; and cost effectiveness. Our success depends on investments in our people, technologies, and products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. To remain competitive, we must be able to identify emerging technology trends and consistently provide superior service, while understanding customer priorities and maintaining customer relationships.\n\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nHistory and Organization\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (\"HII\", the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") is a global, all-domain defense partner, building and delivering the world's most powerful, survivable naval ships and technologies that safeguard America’s seas, sky, land, space, and cyber. For more than a century, our Ingalls Shipbuilding segment (\"Ingalls\") in Mississippi and Newport News Shipbuilding segment (\"Newport News\") in Virginia have built more ships in more ship classes than any other U.S. naval shipbuilder, making us America's largest shipbuilder. Our Mission Technologies segment develops integrated technology solutions and products that enable today's connected, all domain force. Headquartered in Newport News, Virginia, we employ over 44,000 people domestically and internationally.\nWe conduct most of our business with the U.S. Government, primarily the Department of Defense (\"DoD\"). As prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or partner, we participate in many high-priority U.S. defense programs. Ingalls includes our non-nuclear ship design, construction, repair, and maintenance businesses. Newport News includes all of our nuclear ship design, construction, overhaul, refueling, and repair and maintenance businesses. Our Mission Technologies segment provides a wide range of services and products, including command, control, computers, communications, cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and operations; the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to battlefield decisions; defense and offensive cyberspace strategies and electronic warfare; uncrewed autonomous systems; live, virtual, and constructive training solutions; fleet sustainment; and critical nuclear operations.\n\nProvides comprehensive life-cycle sustainment to the U.S. Navy fleet and other DoD and commercial maritime customers.

Serving customers in more than 30 countries, we provide design, autonomy, manufacturing, testing, operations, and sustainment of uncrewed systems, including uncrewed underwater vehicles and uncrewed surface vessels\nNuclear and Environmental Services\nNuclear and Environmental Services support the Department of Energy’s (\"DoE\") national security mission through the management and operation of DoE sites, as well as the safe cleanup of legacy waste across the country. Through participation in joint ventures, including Newport News Nuclear BWXT Los Alamos, LLC (\"N3B\"), Mission Support and Test Services, LLC (\"MSTS\"), and Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (\"SRNS\"), we meet customers’ toughest nuclear and environmental challenges.\nOur revenues are primarily derived from the U.S. Government, including the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, the DoD, the DoE, and other federal agencies. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, approximately 80%, 81%, and 82%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from the U.S. Navy.\nIntellectual Property\nWe develop new technologies that are incorporated into the products and services we provide to our customers. We also develop new manufacturing processes and systems-integration technologies and processes that we use to produce our products and to provide services to our customers. In addition to owning intellectual property, we license intellectual property rights to and from other parties. The U.S. Government generally receives non-exclusive\n\nWe have over 44,000 employees. We are the largest industrial employer in Virginia and the largest private employer in Mississippi. We employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades, with approximately 7,000 engineers and designers and approximately 4,600 employees with advanced degrees. Our workforce contains many third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation employees, and approximately 1,525 employees with more than 40 years of continuous service. Employees in our shipbuilding segments with more than 40 years of continuous service achieve the honor of “Master Shipbuilder.” As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,260 Master Shipbuilders at Newport News and 213 at Ingalls. We also employ more than 6,500 veterans across the enterprise.\nIn addition, over 1,400 apprentices are enrolled in more than 27 crafts and advanced programs at our two shipbuilding segments. From nuclear pipe welders to senior executives, we employ approximately 4,100 apprentice school alumni at Newport News and Ingalls.\nApproximately 45% of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements. Newport News has\ncollective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, which expire in February 2027, December 2027 and April 2029. Ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, all of which expire in March 2026. Approximately 15 Mission Technologies employees in Klamath Falls, Oregon are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in June 2025.\nWe have not experienced a work stoppage in more than 25 years at Newport News and more than 17 years at Ingalls. We are committed to working effectively with our existing unions and believe our relationship with our represented employees is satisfactory.\nThe success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and develop a skilled workforce of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. To succeed in the markets in which we compete for labor, we have developed key workforce development, recruitment, and retention strategies and objectives that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies and objectives form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies, and initiatives:\nCompetitive Pay and Benefits\nOur compensation programs are designed to ensure we have the ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees to achieve our objectives.\nWe provide employee base wages and salaries that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location.\nWe utilize nationally recognized surveys and outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness o",
  "item7_clean": "- Time and materials contracts specify a fixed hourly billing rate for each direct labor hour expended and reimbursement for allowable material costs and expenses.\n- Negotiated contract fee structures include: fixed fee amounts, cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize contractors for under- or over-cost target performance, respectively, positive award fees, and negative penalty arrangements. Profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements, percentage-of-completion of the contract, the achievement of performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.\n- Certain contracts contain award fees based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality, and technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of our performance against such negotiated criteria. We consider award fees to be variable consideration and generally include these fees in the transaction price using a most likely amount approach. Award fees are limited to the extent of funding allotted by the customer and available for performance and those amounts for which a significant reversal of revenue is not probable.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by our management. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. Due to the significant judgment involved in selecting certain of the assumptions used in these policies, it is possible that different parties could choose different assumptions and reach different conclusions. While we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. We consider our policies relating to the following matters to involve our most critical accounting policies and estimates:\nRevenue recognition;\nRetirement related benefit plans; and\nWorkers' compensation.\nMost of our revenues are derived from long-term contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the U.S. Government, which are generally accounted for by recognizing revenues over time using a cost-to-cost measure of progress. In estimating contract costs, we utilize a profit-booking rate based upon performance expectations that incorporate a number of assumptions and estimates regarding risks related to technical requirements, feasibility, schedule, and contract costs. Management performs periodic reviews of the contracts to evaluate the underlying risks, which may increase the profit-booking rate as we are able to mitigate and retire such risks. For the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, see Note 6: Revenue in Item 8.\nRetirement Related Benefit Plans\nWe recognize, on a plan-by-plan basis, the funded status of our retirement related benefit plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet, with corresponding adjustments to after-tax accumulated other comprehensive loss and deferred tax assets or liabilities. The funded status represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. See Note 16: Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Item 8.\nWe calculate our retirement related benefit plan costs under both CAS and U.S. GAAP Financial Accounting Standards (\"FAS\"). The calculations under CAS and FAS require significant judgment. CAS prescribes the determination, allocation, and recovery of retirement related benefit plan costs on U.S. Government contracts through the pricing of products and services. FAS prescribes the methodology used to determine retirement related benefit plan expense or income, as well as the liability, for financial reporting purposes. The CAS requirements for these costs and their calculation methodologies differ from FAS. As a result, while both CAS and FAS use\n\nOperating Performance Assessment and Reporting\nWe manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on individual contracts and programs using the financial measures referred to below, with consideration given to the Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments referred to in this section. Our portfolio of long-term contracts is largely flexibly-priced. Therefore, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts, with operating income being a critical measure of operating performance. Under FAR rules that govern our business with the U.S. Government, most types of costs are allowable, and we do not focus on individual cost groupings, such as cost of sales or general and administrative expenses, as much as we do on total contract costs, which are a key factor in determining contract operating income. As a result, in evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues, as well as operating income, including the effects of significant changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract financial estimates and the use of the cumulative catch-up method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. This approach is consistent with the long-term life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance in a similar manner through contract completion. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing our business.\nSales and Service Revenues\nPeriod-to-period revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts. Changes in sales and service\nrevenues are typically expressed in terms of volume. Unless otherwise described, volume generally refers to\nincreases (or decreases) in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels, delivery rates, or service\nlevels on individual contracts. Volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the\nprofit margin rate for a particular contract.\nSales and service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased $81 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2023, due to higher volumes at Mission Technologies and Ingalls, partially offset by lower volumes at Newport News.\nCost of Sales and Service Revenues\nCost of sales for both product sales and service revenues consists of materials, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs for overhead. We manage the type and amount of costs at the contract level, which is the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of our contracts. Unusual fluctuations in operating performance driven by changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis.\n\nmeasurement during the year, the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.\n- Mortality assumptions are used to determine the retirement related benefit obligations and expense, and represent the likelihood and duration of benefit payments to plan participants based on historical experience and projected longevity. We periodically update our mortality assumptions as circumstances warrant.\nDifferences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status. Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between assumptions and actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss. This unrecognized amount is amortized as a component of net expense to the extent it exceeds 10% of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or plan assets. The amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants. In 2024, the actual return on assets was approximately 7.7%, which was less than the expected return assumption of 8.00%. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the weighted average discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by 70 and 44 basis points, respectively. The differences in asset returns resulted in an actuarial loss of $24 million, and the differences in discount rates resulted in an actuarial gain of $500 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAn increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pension expense and obligations:\nIncrease (Decrease) in 2025 Expense\nIncrease (Decrease) in December 31, 2024 Obligations\n25 basis point decrease in discount rate\n25 basis point increase in discount rate\n25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets\n25 basis point increase in expected return on assets\nAssuming an 8.00% expected return on assets assumption, a $50 million pension plan contribution is generally expected to favorably impact the current year expected return on assets by approximately $2 million, depending on the timing of the contribution.\nSensitivities to assumptions are not necessarily linear and are specific to the time periods noted.\n- In addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs, CAS also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods. While the ultimate liability for such costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. The key drivers of CAS pension cost include the funded status and the method used to calculate CAS reimbursement for each of our plans. A plan’s CAS pension cost can only be allocated until the plan is fully funded as defined under the CAS requirements.\nOther FAS and CAS Pension Considerations -\nA key driver of the difference between FAS expense and CAS cost (and consequently the FAS/CAS Adjustment) is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for actuarial gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements. Under FAS, our net actuarial gains and losses exceeding the 10% corridor are amortized over the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants. Under CAS Harmonization, the amortization period is 10 years for actuarial gains and losses. Both FAS and CAS use a \"market-related value\" of plan assets approach to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. Under CAS, actual asset gains and losses are systematically smoothed over five years, subject to certain limitations. For FAS, we do not use this smoothing method, and instead use fair value in determining our FAS expense. Accordingly, FAS expense generally reflects recent asset gains and losses sooner than CAS.\nAdditionally, CAS cost is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded as defined under CAS. If a plan becomes or ceases to be fully funded due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS cost will change accordingly.\nRetirement Plan Assets -\nRetirement plan assets are stated at fair value. Investments in equity securities (common and preferred) are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists. Investments in fixed-income\n\nKEY SEGMENT FINANCIAL MEASURES\nSales and Service Revenues\nPeriod-to-period revenues reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts. Changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume. Unless otherwise described, volume generally refers to increases (or decreases) in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels, delivery rates, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the profit margin rate for a particular contract.\nSegment Operating Income\nSegment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a segment. Excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance, such as the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes. Changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume, as discussed above, or performance. Performance refers to changes in contract profit margin rates. These changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to estimated costs at completion (\"EAC\"), which reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on that contract. Operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an EAC change is recorded. Segment operating income may also be affected by, among other things, contract performance, inflationary pressures on our supply chain, the effects of workforce stoppages and other labor-related shortfalls, the availability of raw materials, the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes, resolution of disputed items with the customer, recovery of insurance proceeds, and other discrete events. At the completion of a long-term contract, any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized, such as warranty reserves, could also impact contract earnings. Where such items have occurred and the effects are material, a separate description is provided.\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nBusiness Environment\nWe continue to see uncertainty in the economy, our industry, and our company. Our customers, suppliers and subcontractors continue to face challenges, and our results for the year were adversely affected by significant challenges relating to labor availability, our supply chain, and inflation, among other challenges. We cannot predict how long these challenges will continue, whether these challenges will change over time, or whether our actions to address these challenges will be successful.\nU.S. Political and Economic Environment\n– The November 2024 elections, which resulted in Republican control of the executive and legislative branches, has resulted in a range of policy changes both domestically and internationally as Republicans seek to reorient U.S. priorities. The new Administration has employed, and is expected to continue to employ, executive actions and other methods, including regulations and policy proposals that impact trade, tax, immigration, energy policies, and other areas.\nThe debt ceiling is expected to continue to be an area of considerable debate. High debt levels may impose fiscal constraints on many policy objectives, complicating efforts to deliver on promises made during the elections.\nDomestically, we expect that national debt levels, inflationary pressures, gross domestic product growth, among other considerations, could impact U.S. budgets and priorities, including with respect to discretionary spending. While monthly inflation rates have declined since peaking at 9.1% in June of 2022, rising military personnel and operations and maintenance costs continue to pressure the Pentagon’s investment portfolio buying power. If above-\n\naverage inflationary conditions continue over the long-term, additional resources may be required to address contract and labor cost growth.\nGlobal supply chain and labor mark",
