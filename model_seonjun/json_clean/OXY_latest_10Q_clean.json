All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to: any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items or future financial position or sources of financing; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations or business strategy; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.

Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update, modify or withdraw any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nActual outcomes or results may differ from anticipated results, sometimes materially. Forward-looking and other statements regarding Occidental's sustainability efforts and aspirations are not an indication that these statements are necessarily material to investors or require disclosure in Occidental's filings with the SEC. In addition, historical, current and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve and definitions, assumptions, data sources and estimates or measurements that are subject to change in the future, including through rulemaking or guidance. Factors that could cause results to differ from those projected or assumed in any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: Occidental’s ability to consummate the OxyChem Transaction; the possibility that any or all of the conditions to the OxyChem Transaction may not be satisfied or waived, including the failure to obtain the regulatory approvals required for the OxyChem Transaction on the terms expected or on the anticipated schedule or at all; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Purchase Agreement; the effect of the pendency of the OxyChem Transaction on our operating results and business generally;

unexpected changes in costs; government actions (including the effects of announced or future tariff increases and other geopolitical, trade, tariff, fiscal and regulatory uncertainties), war (including the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East) and political conditions and events; inflation, its impact on markets and economic activity and related monetary policy actions by governments in response to inflation; availability of capital resources, levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations;

uncertainties and liabilities associated with acquired and divested properties and businesses; uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves; lower-than-expected production from development projects or acquisitions; Occidental’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes and improve Occidental’s competitiveness; exploration, drilling and other operational risks;

The average WTI price per barrel for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $64.93, compared\nto $63.74 for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and $75.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nChanges in oil prices could result in adjustments to capital investment levels and allocation, which impact production volumes. Oil prices may remain volatile due to geopolitical risks, the evolving macro-economic environment's impact on energy demand, future actions by OPEC and other oil producing countries, and recent sanction and tariff actions.\nIn April 2025, President Trump announced a sweeping tariff policy that imposes a 10% baseline tariff on the majority of imports, with significantly higher reciprocal rates for certain nations. The United States has since engaged with many countries on trade agreements. Since the announcement, many tariff rates have been paused, modified, or subsequently reinstated, and are the subject of ongoing litigation. While the ultimate outcome of the tariff policy is uncertain, the implementation of these tariffs could have several implications for Occidental's business operations and financial performance as tariffs may be levied on the Company's suppliers which in turn may increase costs and could have a macroeconomic impact on demand and prices at which our products can be sold.\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITIES\nOccidental is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition with its portfolio of oil and gas assets as well as its ongoing development of carbon management and sequestration solutions and GHG emissions reduction efforts.
