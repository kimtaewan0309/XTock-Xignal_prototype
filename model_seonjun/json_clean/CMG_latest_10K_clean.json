  "item1_clean": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries (“Chipotle,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) owns and operates Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants, which feature a relevant menu of burritos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla), quesadillas, tacos, and salads. We strive to cultivate a better world by serving responsibly sourced, classically cooked, real food with wholesome ingredients and without artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. We are passionate about providing a great guest experience and making our food more accessible to everyone while continuing to be a brand with a demonstrated purpose. Our first Chipotle restaurant opened in Denver, Colorado in 1993. Over 30 years later, our devotion to seeking out high-quality ingredients, raised with respect for animals, farmers, and the environment, remains at the core of our commitment to Food with Integrity.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned and operated 3,644 Chipotle restaurants throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and 82 international Chipotle restaurants. Additionally, we had three international licensed restaurants. We manage our U.S. operations based on ten regions and aggregate our operations to one reportable segment.\nOur revenue is derived from sales by our restaurants.\nWe are a brand with a demonstrated purpose of Cultivating a Better World. Our mission is to win today while we grow our future by focusing on five key fundamental strategies:\nRunning successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great Food with Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences;\nAmplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain;\nMaking the brand visible, relevant, and loved to acquire new guests and improve overall guest engagement;\nSustaining world class people leadership by developing and retaining top talent at every level; and\nExpanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally.\nServing high-quality food at reasonable prices is critical to ensuring guests enjoy wholesome food at a great value. In Chipotle-owned and operated restaurants, we strive to serve only animal products that are raised in accordance with criteria we have established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare, and without the use of non-therapeutic antibiotics or added growth hormones. We brand our meats as “Responsibly Raised®.” We also seek to use responsibly grown produce, by which we mean produce grown by suppliers whose practices conform to our Food with Integrity standards and our priorities with respect to environmental considerations and employee welfare. For more information about our sustainability and animal welfare initiatives, see our biennial Sustainability Report and interim Update Report on our website www.chipotle.com/sustainability.\nMaintaining the high levels of quality and safety we demand in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire high-quality, fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. We work with 26 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers that purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on the suppliers' understanding of and adherence to our mission and Food with Integrity standards, quality and price availability. We have also sought to increase the number of suppliers for our ingredients to help mitigate pricing volatility and reduce our reliance on one or several suppliers, which could create supply shortages. In addition, we closely monitor industry news, trade tariffs, weather, exchange rates, foreign demand, geopolitical crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices or available supply. Certain key ingredients are purchased from a small number of suppliers.\nQuality Assurance and Food Safety\nWe are committed to serving only safe, high-quality food. Our food safety and quality assurance teams work to ensure compliance with our food safety programs and practices, components of which include:\nnaturally derived inhibitors to prevent microbial growth in ingredients;\nadvanced technologies and tools that reduce or eliminate pathogens while maintaining food quality;\nenhanced restaurant procedures and protocols for handling ingredients and sanitizing surfaces in our restaurants;\nfood safety certifications;\ninternal and third-party restaurant inspections;\nsmall grower support during on-site audits;\nsupplier interventions steps to mitigate food safety risks before ingredients reach Chipotle; and\ningredient traceability.\nThese and other food safety practices underscore our commitment to be a leader in food safety while continuing to serve high-quality food that our guests love. Our food safety and quality assurance teams establish and monitor our quality and food safety programs and work closely with suppliers to ensure our high standards are met throughout the supply chain. We maintain a limited list of approved suppliers, many of whom are among the top suppliers in the industry. In addition, we have a team approach where our training, operations, culinary, legal and restaurant food safety and quality assurance departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality, food preparation, restaurant cleanliness, employee health protocols, and safety in the restaurants. Our food safety programs are also intended to ensure we not only continue to comply with applicable food safety regulations, but also establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. To help achieve this goal, we have a Food Safety Advisory Council comprised of some of the nation’s foremost food safety authorities. The Food Safety Advisory Council is charged with evaluating our programs and advising us on ways to maintain and elevate our food safety program. Our food safety and quality assurance team members hold board seats and participate in technical working groups with several associations. This gives us the opportunity to learn and share our knowledge and expertise with other food safety professionals and regulatory agencies.\nDigital Business and Innovation\nOur digital platform continues to be a strategic driver of our growth. Digital sales represent food and beverage revenue for company-owned restaurants generated through the Chipotle website, Chipotle app or third-party delivery aggregators and include revenue deferrals associated with Chipotle Rewards. Digital sales represented 35.1% of food and beverage revenue in 2024, compared to 37.4% in 2023. We have made digital ordering convenient with continued enhancements to our app and by building more Chipotlanes, which is our drive through format for guest pick-up of digital orders. We are also investing in technology and tools to modernize the back of house of our restaurants and to improve the team member experience.\nAt Chipotle, our vision is to cultivate an environment where our employees can thrive and grow into great leaders. We believe in investing and supporting our people because they are our most important asset. As of December 31, 2024, Chipotle employed 130,504 people worldwide and 1,328 contract workers. Of our employees, 127,820 worked in the United States, and 2,684 worked internationally across Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Within the U.S., 126,233 employees worked in our restaurants, and 1,587 in our Restaurant Support Centers and Field Leadership. There were no union petitions or campaigns in 2024, and we continue to bargain in good faith with the one restaurant that voted in 2022 to form a union. We also continue to focus on building a positive people culture where employees feel supported, heard, and are able to grow with Chipotle.\nWe remain committed to the growth, development, and advancement of our people. In 2024, over 85% of our in-restaurant leadership roles were filled through internal promotions, which remains a critical component to our staffing strategy. To continually attract and hire external talent, we remain focused on creating a best-in-class job seeker and General Manager hiring experience that prioritizes speed, but that also aims to create a transparent process; an experience that identifies shift-specific needs and elevates our talent bar for quality-of-hire. We have seen early success with our new virtual hiring assistant \"Ava Cado\", almost doubling our application flow. With Ava Cado, approximately 90% of applications are completed, and restaurants are leveraging automated interview rescheduling, freeing up managers to run great restaurants and serve our guests.\nTo expand our recruitment marketing efforts we continue developing both new and existing partnerships, such as Transition Overwatch and Recruit Military, which assist transitioning Veterans and their spouses. We also prioritize understanding the hiring needs of our international operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.\nCulture and Inclusivity (\"C&I\")\nOur purpose extends beyond serving nutritious food using real ingredients. We are on a journey to create a global culture where everyone is welcome and feels a genuine sense of belonging, and we believe this is achieved through our daily interactions and commitment to model inclusive leadership.\nIn 2024, Chipotle continued to invest in employee development and training. Our learning programs include inclusive topics and skill-building to provide our leaders with the resources they need to succeed in their current roles and prepare for the future. Our training programs will continue to evolve to respond to a constantly changing world.\nDevotion to our culture of inclusivity emanates from our values and the belief that our people make us what we are. We do not see inclusion as a moment, but a movement towards a future where all people can experience success as their best authentic selves. That is why our efforts are not confined to certain roles, departments, identities, or geographies. Driven by a strategy spanning across culture, community, candidate, career, and commerce, we are making meaningful strides towards a future where diversity is understood, embraced, and is a source of our strength.\nMaintaining a work environment where all people can succeed as their full authentic self is critical to our success as a business. To deliver meaningful programs that meet the needs of our employees, it is important we understand the dynamic composition of our workforce. As of December 31, 2024, 48.9% of our workforce was male and 49.8% of our workforce was female.\n\nOur most recent Equal Employment Opportunity consolidated report is posted on the Investors page of our website at www.ir.chipotle.com under Corporate Governance – Human Capital Information and additional details about the demographics of our employee population is included in our biennial Sustainability Report and interim Update Report on our website www.chipotle.com/sustainability\nWe have undertaken a range of activity to promote a culture of inclusion:\nWe continue to drive a consistent and structured candidate interview process with interview guides. This ensures top candidates are identified through equitable hiring practices in both internal and external candidate interviews. We also launched an internal job board across multiple communication channels to provide increased visibility and access to internal opportunities.\nIn 2024, Chipotle hired a Director of C&I to create and execute a strategy for inclusion, advise across Centers of Excellence, and enhance existing programs with C&I training. This specialized role is also responsible for the continued maturation of our Employee Resource Groups through a new strategy that improves the leader and member experience.\nWe have a holistic approach to pay equity to ensure consistent and equitable compensation among",
  "item7_clean": "(dollars in millions)\nProvision for income taxes\nEffective income tax rate\neffective income tax rate decreased 0.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower nondeductible expenses of 0.6% and income tax reserves of 0.4%. These decreases were partially offset by a 0.6% reduction in tax benefits related to option exercise and equity vesting.\nQuarterly Financial Data/Seasonality\nSeasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. Seasonal factors, however, might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results, such as unexpected publicity impacting our business in a positive or negative way, disease outbreak, epidemic or endemic, the impact of inflation on consumer spending, fluctuations in food or packaging costs, or the timing of menu price increases or promotional activities and other marketing initiatives. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results, although, on an overall annual basis, changes in trading days do not have a significant impact.\nOur quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax rate impacts, litigation, settlement costs and related legal expenses, impairment charges and non-operating costs, timing of marketing or promotional expenses, the number and timing of new restaurants opened in a quarter, and closure of restaurants. New restaurants typically have higher operating costs following opening because of the expenses associated with their opening and operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Investments\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a cash and marketable investments balance of $2.2 billion, non-marketable investments of $85.2 million, and $29.8 million of restricted cash. After funding the current operations in our restaurants and support centers, the first planned use of our cash flow from operations is to provide capital for the continued investment in new restaurant construction. In addition to continuing to invest in our restaurant expansion, we expect to utilize cash flow from operations to: repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions; invest in, maintain, and refurbish our existing restaurants; and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, $1.0 billion remained available for repurchases of shares of our common stock, which includes the $300.0 million additional authorization approved by our Board of Directors on December 17, 2024. Under the remaining repurchase authorizations, shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, subject to market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $500.0 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under a line of credit facility.\nWe believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and investment balances, will be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future. Assuming no significant declines in comparable restaurant sales, we expect we will generate positive cash flow for the foreseeable future.\nWe have not required significant working capital because guests generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverages and supplies sometime after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth.\nOur total capital expenditures for 2024 were $593.6 million. In 2024, we spent on average about $1.5 million in development and construction costs per new restaurant, or about $1.3 million net of landlord reimbursements of $0.2 million. In 2025, we expect to incur about $683.7 million in total capital expenditures. We expect approximately $502.7 million in capital expenditures related to our construction of new restaurants, before any reductions for landlord reimbursements. We expect the average investment cost for new restaurants opening in 2025 will be slightly higher than the average investment costs for those opened in 2024. We expect approximately $149.0 million in capital expenditures related to investments in existing restaurants including remodeling and similar improvements, new equipment and hardware, and technology to optimize efficiencies. Finally, we expect a portion of our incurred capital expenditures to be for additional corporate initiatives including investments in technology to boost innovation, enhance the guest experience, and improve operations.\nThe following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2024, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows:\nPayments Due by Fiscal Year\n(dollars in millions)\nPurchase obligations\nof our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” This includes commitments related to reasonably certain renewal periods for leases that have commenced and includes legally binding lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced.\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms. We have excluded agreements that are cancellable without penalty. The majority of our purchase obligations relate to food, beverage and packaging, capital projects, information technology, marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships, and other miscellaneous items.\nThe above table does not include income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. Additionally, we have excluded our estimated loss contingencies, due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of payment. See\nNote 11. “Commitments and Contingencies”\nof our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nCash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher net earnings and, to a lesser extent, net cash changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash used in investing activities was $837.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $946.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change was primarily associated with a $121.2 million decrease in investment purchases net of investment maturities. This was partially offset by increased capital expenditures of $32.9 million primarily related to costs associated with new restaurant development.\nCash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $660.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change was primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock of $409.2 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe describe our significant accounting policies in\nNote 1. “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”\nof our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors.\nThe majority of our operating leases consist of restaurant locations and office space. We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception. Our leases generally have remaining terms of 1-20 years and most include options to extend the leases for additional 5-year periods. Generally, the lease term is the minimum of the noncancelable period of the lease or the lease term inclusive of reasonably certain renewal periods up to a term of 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably certain lease term was changed, our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date, which is the date we control the use of the property. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. We made the policy election to combine lease and non-lease components. We consider fixed common area maintenance (“CAM”) part of our fixed future lease payments; therefore, fixed CAM is also included in our operating lease liability. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments, initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of operating lease assets. To determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid, we estimate incremental borrowing rates corresponding to the reasonably certain lease term. As we have no outstanding debt nor committed credit facilities, secured or otherwise, we estimate this rate based on prevailing financial market conditions, comparable company and credit analysis, and management judgment. If the estimate of our incremental borrowing rate was changed, our operating lease assets and liabilities could differ materially.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For restaurant assets, we test impairment at the individual restaurant asset group level, which includes leasehold improvements, property and equipment and operating lease assets.\nThe fair value measurement for asset impairment is generally based on Level 3 inputs. We first compare the carrying value of the asset (or asset group, referred interchangeably throughout as asset) to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the asset is generally determined using the income approach to measure the fair value, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Key inputs to the income approach for restaurant assets include the discount rate, projected revenue and expenses, and sublease income if we are closing the restaurant. In certain cases, management uses other market information, when available, to estimate the fair value of an asset. The impairment charges represent the excess of each asset’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value and are allocated among the long-lived asset or assets of the group.\nOur estimates of future revenues and expenses are highly subjective judgments based on internal projections and knowledge of our operations, historical performance, and trends in sales and restaurant operating costs, and can be significantly impacted by changes in our business or economic conditions. The determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment and utilizes valuation techniques including discounting estimated future cash flows and market-based analyses to determine fair value. If our estimates or underlying assumptions, including discount rate and sublease income change in the future, our operating results may be materially impacted.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the requisite service period based on the award’s fair value. Under our stock incentive plans, we issue stock-only stock appreciation rights (\"SOSARs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), and performance stock units (\"PSUs\"). We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our SOSARs, and we use the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of PSUs that contain market conditions. Both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. The volatility and the expected life assumptions are based on our historical data. Similarly, the compensation expense of performance share awards is based in part on the estimated probability of achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares. We determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance. Those estimates are based on a number of assumptions, including but not limited to growth in restaurant cash flow dollars, average restaurant level operating margin, and growth in new restaurant openings, and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards. If we change our estimates of stock price volatility or expected lives of our SOSARs, or if we change our assumptions regarding the probability of achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations may be materially impacted.\nOur provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation allowance requires the use of estimates based on our management’s interpretation and application of complex tax laws and accounting guidance. The majority of our income tax liability is incurred in the U.S. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions for material, known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the measurement and recognition of the item. We may adjust these reserves when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available and will be reflected in the period in which the new information is available, or due to the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations. While we believe that our reserves are adequate, issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related reserve and could materially increase or decrease our income tax provision in future periods.\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned 3,644 Chipotle restaurants throughout the United States, and 82 international Chipotle restaurants. Additionally, we had three international licensed restaurants.\nWe manage our U.S. operations based on\nregions and agg",
