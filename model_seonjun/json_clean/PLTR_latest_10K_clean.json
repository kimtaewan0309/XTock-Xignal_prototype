We originally built Apollo to enable the continuous delivery of our software wherever our customers are: in the cloud, on-premises, or even more rugged environments. Today, Apollo enables the rapid, secure delivery of our software and updates across our business, and also enables our customers to securely deploy their own software in virtually any environment. Apollo provides a single control layer to coordinate ongoing delivery of new features, security updates, and platform configurations.\nWe work with many of the world’s leading government and commercial institutions. As of December 31, 2024, we had 711 customers.\nOur software is currently used across approximately 90 industries around the world. It is applied to a variety of use cases by users across various business functions and levels of organizations, including by utility operations analysts, automotive manufacturing workers, oil and gas technicians and operators, and pharmaceutical researchers in the United States; supply-chain managers in South Korea; public health administrators in the United Kingdom and the United States; and special forces personnel and military officials in the United States and abroad.\nOf the $2.9 billion in revenue that we generated in 2024, 55% came from customers in the government segment, and 45% came from customers in the commercial segment.\nOur business continues to have a global presence. In 2024, we earned 66% of our revenue from customers in the United States, and 34% from those abroad.\nThe average revenue for our top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was $64.6 million, and is up from 2023, when the average revenue from our top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $54.6 million, demonstrating our expanding relationships with existing customers.\nOur approach to sales and marketing is built around discussions with existing and prospective customers in order to understand the principal challenges our customers face and identify ways in which our software platforms can provide long-term value and results. We continue to evaluate and refine our sales and marketing approach as we develop relationships with existing and prospective customers. For example, beginning in 2023, we introduced AIP bootcamps to the initial stages of our customer acquisition process, which helped to accelerate these discussions and provide an opportunity for our customers to experience our platforms through their own use cases in days.\nCustomer Acquisition\nOur customer acquisition strategy generally targets large-scale, hard-to-execute opportunities at large government and commercial institutions. The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the long sales cycles associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition. The larger, more complex, and more technologically demanding the problem, the more likely we are to succeed. Additionally, our focus in the short term remains making our principal software platforms available to an increasingly broad swath of our potential market. We believe that every institution faces challenges that our platforms and products were designed to address.\nAcross both the public and private sectors, there is a history of failures when investing in new technologies. One U.S. military department spent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.\nMany of our customers have had similar experiences investing millions — even billions — of dollars in digital transformation projects, enterprise data warehouses, and digital twin initiatives that never really worked.\nThese failures have made both software buyers and vendors highly risk-averse. Institutions often doubt that any vendor can implement a working solution and are unwilling to invest. On the other hand, smaller technology companies are often unable to\ncompete for complex, large-scale opportunities because installation costs and the risks of failure are too high, and the sales cycles too long.\nThese are precisely the opportunities we target. Rather than reject projects with risky and resource intensive installation requirements, we actively seek them out.\nThere are a number of sales and marketing strategies that have accelerated our ability to acquire customers in recent years:\nExpansion of Access to Platforms\nThe speed with which our platforms can be deployed has significantly expanded the range of potential customers with which we plan on partnering over the long term. During 2023, we introduced AIP bootcamps, which allow us to deliver real workflows on actual customer data in days. We anticipate that our reach among an increasingly broad set of customers, in both the commercial and government sectors, will accelerate moving forward, aided by our sales and marketing approaches, including AIP bootcamps and other pilots. Additionally, in 2024, we introduced Developer Tier, offering limited access to Foundry and AIP in the United States and select countries. This expansion allows developers to explore, innovate, and develop without significant upfront enterprise costs.\nOur proximity to a variety of businesses and the industries in which they are operating has enhanced, and is expected to continue enhancing, our own product and business development efforts, as we continue expanding access to our platforms to the broadest possible set of customers. We believe that, as these new partners grow, we will grow with them.\nWe have invested and may continue to invest in an account-based sales force to identify and capture new customers and opportunities.\nWe believe that our decision to build our sales force in recent years has resulted in multiple new customers, and the broadening and expansion of our commercial customer base and relationships with leading government agencies around the world.\nSector and Industry Operating Systems\nIn addition to supporting individual institutions, our platforms have become central operating systems for entire industries and sectors. We are developing industry operating systems to help companies and government agencies manage operations across their entire organizations. These operating systems allow our software to be distributed at scale to institutions within given industries. We have and are continuing to develop partnerships in industries such as airline, insurance, healthcare, automotive, security and risk management, and government, which we anticipate will have a significant impact on our business moving forward.\nWe continue to believe we are uniquely positioned to provide commercially available software to the U.S. federal government. Our government customers remain a meaningful source of revenue for our business. We intend to capture an even greater share of U.S. federal government spending on software systems.\nSee the section titled\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Our Customers”\nfor a discussion of the terms of our government contracts.\nChannel Sales & Cloud Partnerships\nWe have entered into, and continue to explore the development of, partnerships for specific industries and sectors by partnering closely with leading providers of public, private, and hybrid cloud services, which have relationships with essentially every major enterprise in the world and have large, existing sales forces. These cloud partnerships emerged as an extension of the large computing requirements for our platforms and the migration towards the cloud as the hosting environment of choice for many customers. The existing footprint of these providers provides us with access to their large customer base and expands our distribution capabilities.\nWe have also continued to explore the establishment of channel sales relationships and similar alliances with public and private organizations, opening a path for us to partner with varying providers, including smaller technology providers.\nJoint Ventures & New Business Partnerships\nWe intend to continue to form joint ventures and new business partnerships, where we believe specific industries or sectors require a partner and additional investment in order to realize the full potential of our platforms. For example, we, through Palantir Technologies Japan KK, entered into a strategic global partnership with Fujitsu Limited through which the parties will incorporate the capabilities of Foundry and AIP as a key element in the data infrastructure for Fujitsu Uvance, a portfolio of global solutions that address business challenges and solve societal issues.\nThere are a number of sales and marketing strategies that we use to drive revenue growth at an account.\nThese strategies include (i) creating new ecosystem partnerships to extend the platform beyond the customer’s four walls into the operations of its partners and suppliers, (ii) selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities, and (iii) selling strategic implementations of our software against specific use cases, which deliver competitive differentiation.\nOur sales and marketing strategies allow us to scale existing customer contracts horizontally to include additional divisions or functions within a single institution and vertically to include additional users and user groups. In tackling the customer’s most pressing and challenging problems first, we establish the trust needed to expand platform usage across the full enterprise.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that in order to fully address the most complex and valuable challenges that our customers face, we must experience and understand their problems firsthand. To do so, we embed with our users. Our research and development function is responsible for the design, development, testing, validation, and refinement of our platforms, and embedding with our users allows us to identify research and development opportunities for our platforms or new products. We focus on innovating and developing new features and modules for our new and existing platforms, including AIP, or new products, and further enhancing the functionality, compatibility, reliability, usability, and performance of our platforms. By leveraging the tens of thousands of front-line hours across various industries and using emerging technologies, we can better anticipate customer needs and bring new use cases and new applications of services to our existing and potential customers. Our AIP bootcamps have and may continue to provide a forum to experience these new use cases and applications. Many of our current research and development efforts are focused on deploying software, models, and other critical assets at the edge. This includes integrations with complex hardware, operations in disconnected environments, and more. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and development to broaden our platform capabilities, strengthen our existing platforms and innovate.\nPrivacy and Civil Liberties\nWe are committed to ensuring that our software is as effective as possible while preserving individuals’ fundamental rights, including privacy and civil liberties. We have made deep investments to ensure that privacy, civil liberties, and other fundamental rights protections remain central to our software and business practices.\nOur platforms were built from the start to protect individual privacy and prevent the misuse of information. We are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build software platforms that enable our customers to integrate their own data — data to which they already have access.\nThe same technology that makes Palantir’s software platforms so analytically powerful — the ability to construct a model of the real world from countless data points — is what en",
  "item7_clean": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Total Remaining Deal Value,\nwas $5.4 billion. Of our total remaining deal value, as of December 31, 2024, $3.1 billion was the remaining deal value of our contracts with commercial customers and $2.3 billion was the remaining deal value of our contracts with government customers.\nMany of these contracts are subject to termination for convenience provisions. Additionally, the U.S. federal government is prohibited from exercising contract options more than one year in advance. As a result, there can be no guarantee that our customer contracts will not be terminated or that contract options will be exercised.\nWe historically have not realized all of the revenue from the full deal value of our customer contracts, and we may not do so in the future. This is because the actual timing and amount of revenue under contracts included are subject to various contingencies, including exercise of contractual options, customers not terminating their contracts, renegotiation of contracts, and other macroeconomic factors that may potentially inhibit a customer’s ability to pay. In addition, delays in the completion of the U.S. government’s budgeting process, the use of continuing resolutions, and a potential lapse in appropriations, or similar events in other jurisdictions, has and could in the future adversely affect our ability to timely recognize revenue under certain government contracts. If we are unable to realize all of the revenue from the full deal value of our customer contracts, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations and our key business measures are likely to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis in future periods and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly results of operations, including cash flows, have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results, financial position, and operations are likely to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Fluctuation in quarterly results may also negatively impact the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe typically close a large portion of our sales in the last several weeks of a quarter, which impacts our ability to plan and manage margins and cash flows. Our sales cycle is often long, and it is difficult to predict exactly when, or if, we will actually make a sale with a potential customer, particularly large government and commercial customers. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or delay of one or more large sales transactions in a quarter would impact our results of operations and cash flow for that quarter and any future quarters in which revenue from that transaction is lost or delayed. In addition, downturns in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our revenue because we generally recognize revenue over the term of our contracts. The timing of\ncustomer billing and payment varies from contract to contract. A delay in the timing of receipt of such collections, or a default on a large contract, may negatively impact our liquidity for the period and in the future. Because a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and require time to adjust, our results of operations and liquidity would suffer if revenue fell below our expectations in a particular period.\nOther factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and financial position include, without limitation, those listed below:\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts, including the success of our pilot deployments (including bootcamps);\nour ability to increase our contribution margins;\nthe timing of expenses and revenue recognition, including from changes in accounting assumptions or estimates;\nthe timing and amount of payments received from our customers;\ntermination of one or more large contracts by customers, including for convenience;\nthe time and cost-intensive nature of our sales efforts and the length and variability of sales cycles;\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the development, maintenance, and expansion of our business and operations;\nthe timing and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\nthe timing and success of new platforms, products, features, and functionality introduced by us or our competitors;\ninterruptions or delays in our operations and maintenance (“O&M”) services;\ncyberattacks and other actual or perceived data or security breaches or incidents;\nour ability to hire and retain employees, in particular, those responsible for operations and maintenance of and the selling or marketing of our platforms, and develop and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe amount and timing of our stock-based compensation expenses;\nthe amount and timing of employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation resulting from increases in our stock price;\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our employees;\nchanges in the way we operate and maintain our platforms;\nunforeseen negative results in operations from our partnerships;\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry;\nthe cost of and potential outcomes of existing and future claims or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business;\nchanges in laws and regulations that impact our business, such as the FASA or the European Union (“EU”) AI Act (“EU AIA”);\nindemnification payments to our customers or other third parties;\nability to scale our business with increasing demands;\nthe timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and\ngeneral economic, regulatory, and market conditions, including the impacts of ongoing conflicts, such as those in Russia-Ukraine and Israel, and any related economic sanctions and regional instability, heightened interest rates, monetary policy changes, or foreign currency fluctuations.\nIn addition, many of our contracts contain termination for convenience provisions, and we may be obligated to repay prepaid amounts or otherwise not realize anticipated future revenue should we fail to provide products or future services as anticipated. These factors make it difficult for us to accurately predict financial metrics for any particular period.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other key metrics\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the trading price of our Class A common stock could fall, and we could face costly lawsuits. We and certain of our officers and directors were sued in purported class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. For additional information see\nNote 8. Commitments and Contingencies\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position.\nHistorically, the first quarter of our year generally has relatively lower sales, and sales generally increase in each subsequent quarter with substantial increases during our third and fourth quarters ending September 30 and December 31, respectively. We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including:\nthe fiscal year end procurement cycle of our government customers, and in particular U.S. government customers which have a fiscal year end of September 30;\nthe fiscal year budgeting process for our commercial customers, many of which have a fiscal year end of December 31;\nseasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in the United States, Europe, and certain other regions; and\ntiming of projects and our customers’ evaluation of our work progress.\nThis seasonality has historically impacted and may in the future continue to impact the timing of collections and recognized revenue. Because a significant portion of our customer contracts are typically finalized near the end of the year, and we typically invoice customers shortly after entering into a contract, we may receive a portion of our customer payments near the end of the year and record such payment as an increase in deferred revenue or customer deposits (“contract liabilities”), while the revenue from our customer contracts is generally recognized over the contract term. While we have historically billed and collected payments for multiple contract years from certain customers in advance, we have shifted, and may continue to shift, to collecting payments on an annual or other basis, including in arrears.\nWhile this has been the historical seasonal pattern of our quarterly sales, we believe that our customers’ required timing for certain new government or commercial programs requiring new software may outweigh the nature or magnitude of seasonal factors that might have influenced our business to date. As a result, we may experience future growth from additional government or commercial mandates that do not follow the seasonal purchasing and evaluation decisions by our customers that we have historically observed.\nFor example, increased government spending on technology aimed at national defense, financial or policy regulation, cybersecurity, or healthcare mandates may drive customer demand at different times throughout our year, the timing of which we may not be able to anticipate and may cause fluctuations in our results of operations. The timing of our fiscal quarters and the U.S. federal government’s September 30 fiscal year end also may impact sales to governmental agencies in the third quarter of our year, offsetting, at least in part, the otherwise seasonal downturn we have historically observed in later summer months.\nOur rapid growth in recent years may obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our business and may continue to affect our business. We expect that seasonality will continue to materially impact our business in the future and may become more pronounced over time. The seasonality of our business may cause continued or increased fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows, which may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or annual forecasts or meeting or exceeding the expectations of research analysts or investors, which in turn may cause a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur platforms are complex and may have a lengthy implementation process, and any failure of our platforms to satisfy our customers or perform as desired could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur platforms and services are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of network environments. Implementing our platforms can be a complex and lengthy process since we often configure our existing platforms for a customer’s unique environment. Inability to meet the unique needs of our customers may result in customer dissatisfaction and/or damage to our reputation, which could materially harm our business. Further, the proper use of our platforms may require training of the customer and the initial or ongoing services of our technical personnel as well as O&M services over the contract term. If training and/or ongoing services require more of our expenditures than we originally estimated, our margins will be lower than projected.\nIn addition, if our customers do not use our platforms correctly or as intended, inadequate performance or outcomes may result. It is possible that our platforms may also be intentionally misused or abused by customers or their employees or third parties\nwho obtain access and use of our platforms. Similarly, our platforms sometimes are used by customers with smaller or less sophisticated IT departments, potentially resulting in sub-optimal performance at a level lower than anticipated by the customer. Because our customers rely on our platforms and services to address important business goals and challenges, the incorrect or improper use or configuration of our platforms and O&M services, failure to properly train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our platforms, or failure to properly provide implementation or analytical or maintenance services to our customers may result in contract terminations or non-renewals, reduced customer payments, negative publicity, or legal claims against us. For example, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to properly provide these services may result in lost opportunities for follow-on expansion sales of our platforms and services.\nFurthermore, if customer personnel are not well trained in the use of our platforms, customers may defer the deployment of our platforms and services, may deploy them in a more limited manner than originally anticipated, or may not deploy them at all. If there is substantial turnover of the Company or customer personnel responsible for procurement and use of our platforms, our platforms may go unused or be adopted less broadly, and our ability to make additional sales may be substantially limited, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nIf we do not successfully develop and deploy new technologies (such as technologies incorporating AI) to address the needs of our customers, our business and results of operations could suffer.\nOur success has been based on our ability to design software and products that enable the integration of data into a common operating environment to facilitate advanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration. We spend substantial amounts of time and money researching and developing new technologies and enhanced versions of existing features to meet our customers’ and potential customers’ rapidly evolving needs. There is no assurance that our enhancements to our platforms or our new product features, capabilities, or offerings, including new platforms or product modules, such as our Artificial Intelligence Platform (“AIP”), will, either individually or in the aggregate, be compelling to our customers, gain market acceptance, or have a positive or material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, in each case in a timely or cost-effective manner. For example, we and our peers and competitors are investing more significantly in AI (including machine learning, large language and other generative AI models, and software functionality to operationalize the foregoing). There are significant risks involved in deploying AI and there can be no assurance that using AI in our platforms and products will enhance or be beneficial to our business, including our profitability. Further, other companies may develop products that are similar to ours, or adopt and implement AI more successfully or at a quicker pace than us. If our research and development investments do not accurately anticipate customer demand or if we fail to develop our platforms in a manner that satisfies customer preferences or needs in a timely and cost-effective manner, we ma",
