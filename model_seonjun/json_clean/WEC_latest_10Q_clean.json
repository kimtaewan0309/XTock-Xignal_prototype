MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS\nWe are a diversified holding company with natural gas and electric utility operations (serving customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota), an approximately 60% equity ownership interest in ATC (a for-profit electric transmission company regulated by the FERC and certain state regulatory commissions), and non-utility energy infrastructure operations through We Power (which owns generation assets in Wisconsin that it leases to WE), Bluewater (which owns underground natural gas storage facilities in Michigan), and WECI, which holds ownership interests in several renewable generating facilities.\nOur goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for our shareholders and customers by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: environmental stewardship; reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; exceptional customer care; and safety. Our capital plan provides a roadmap for us to achieve this goal. It is an aggressive plan to cut emissions, maintain superior reliability, deliver significant savings for customers, and grow our investment in the future of energy.\nThroughout our strategic planning process, we take into account important developments, risks and opportunities, including new technologies, customer preferences and affordability, energy resiliency efforts, and sustainability.\nCreating a Sustainable Future\nOur capital plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with zero-carbon-emitting renewables and reliable, efficient natural gas-fired generation. The retirements are intended to address compliance with the EPA Clean Air rules as well as contribute to meeting our goals to reduce CO\nemissions from our electric generation. When taken together, the retirements and new investments in renewables and reliable, efficient natural gas generation should better balance our supply with our demand, while helping to address compliance and maintaining reliable, affordable energy for our customers.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, we made a decision to reconsider our near-term CO\nemission reduction goals due to a combination of factors, including tightened energy supply requirements in the Midwest power market and the need to serve our customers with safe, reliable, and affordable energy. However, our long-term goal to achieve net carbon neutral electric generation by 2050 remains intact. We expect to achieve this goal by continuing to make operating refinements, retiring less efficient generating units, and executing our capital plan. As part of our path toward this goal, we have started implementing co-firing with natural gas at the ERGS coal-fired units and at Weston Unit 4. We expect to use coal only as a backup fuel by the end of 2030 and to be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the end of 2032.\nWe have already retired nearly 2,500 MWs of fossil-fueled generation since the beginning of 2018, which includes the retirement of OCPP Units 5 and 6 in May 2024, the 2019 retirement of the PIPP, and the 2018 retirements of the Pleasant Prairie power plant, the Pulliam power plant, and the jointly-owned Edgewater Unit 4 generating unit. We expect to retire approximately 900 MWs of additional coal-fired generation by the end of 2031, which includes the planned retirements of OCPP Units 7 and 8 and Weston Unit 3. In conjunction with our new capital plan, we and the other co-owners of Columbia Units 1 and 2 currently plan to continue coal operations at these units through at least 2029, and continue to evaluate the conversion of both units to natural gas. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information related to Columbia Units 1 and 2 and our planned power plant retirements.\nIn addition to retiring these older, fossil-fueled plants, we expect to invest approximately $11.6 billion from 2026 to 2030 in regulated renewable energy in Wisconsin. Our plan is to replace a portion of the retired capacity by building and owning zero-carbon-emitting renewable generation facilities that are anticipated to include the following investments:\n3,700 MWs of utility-scale solar;\n1,780 MWs of battery storage; and\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nWe also plan on investing in a combination of clean, natural gas-fired generation, including:\n3,300 MWs of CTs (we plan on constructing a new natural gas lateral pipeline to support the CTs planned at our OCPP site); and\n180 MWs of RICE natural gas-fueled generation.\nFor more details on the projects discussed above, see Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Requirements – Significant Capital Projects.\nIn December 2018, WE received approval from the PSCW for two renewable energy pilot programs. The Solar Now pilot is expected to add a total of 35 MWs of solar generation to WE's portfolio, allowing non-profit and governmental entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers, to site utility owned solar arrays on their property. Under this program, WE has energized 30 Solar Now projects, totaling more than 30 MWs. The second program, the DRER pilot, is designed to allow large commercial and industrial customers to access renewable resources that WE would operate. The DRER pilot is intended to help these larger customers meet their sustainability and renewable energy goals, and could add up to 35 MWs of renewables to WE's portfolio. WE has signed up one customer under this program for 4 MWs of generation capacity. In July 2023, the PSCW approved the Renewable Pathway Pilot, the third renewable energy program. This program allows WE and WPS commercial and industrial customers to subscribe to a portion of a utility-scale Wisconsin-based renewable energy generating facility for up to 125 MWs at WE and 40 MWs at WPS. Under this program, WE and WPS collectively have 16 active contracts, for a total of approximately 47 MWs of generation capacity.\nIn August 2021, the PSCW approved pilot programs for WE and WPS to install and maintain EV charging equipment for customers at their homes or businesses. We proposed modifications to these pilot programs, which were approved by the PSCW and implemented on January 1, 2025. The programs provide direct benefits to customers by removing cost barriers associated with installing EV equipment. In October 2021, subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, we pledged to expand the EV charging network within the service territories of our electric utilities. In doing so, we joined a coalition of utility companies in a unified effort to make EV charging convenient and widely available throughout the Midwest. The coalition we joined is planning to help build and grow EV charging corridors, enabling the general public to safely and efficiently charge their vehicles.\nWe also continue to focus on methane emission reductions by improving and upgrading our natural gas distribution systems, and using RNG throughout our natural gas utility systems. In 2022, we received approval from the PSCW for our RNG pilots and in 2023, we began transporting the output of local dairy farms onto our natural gas distribution systems in Wisconsin. The RNG supplied is expected to directly replace higher-emission methane from natural gas that would have entered our pipes. We currently have contracts in place for 2.1 Bcf of RNG. In light of our progress, significant uncertainty surrounding the market for RTCs, and our desire to focus on long-term GHG emissions-reduction across the enterprise, in the third quarter of 2025, we made a decision to reassess our previous, standalone goal related to methane emissions from natural gas distribution.\nIn December 2023, we started a pilot program with Electric Power Research Institute and CMBlu Energy, a Germany-based designer and manufacturer of an organic solid flow battery, to test this new form of long-duration energy storage on the U.S. electric grid at our VAPP. The program will test battery system performance, including the ability to store and discharge energy for up to twice as long as the typical lithium-ion batteries in use today. We expect the pilot activities to continue into 2026.\nWe have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and in accordance with our capital plan, expect to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet, as well as our electric and natural gas distribution networks to further improve reliability.\nBelow are a few examples of reliability projects that are proposed, currently underway, or recently completed.\nThe PSCW approved WE's request to construct an LNG facility with a storage capacity of two Bcf, which will be located on the OCPP site. In addition, the construction of additional LNG facilities in Wisconsin has been proposed as part of our capital plan and would provide another approximately four Bcf of natural gas supply. The LNG facilities are expected to reduce the likelihood of constraints on our natural gas distribution system during the highest demand days of winter.\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nPGL had been working to replace old iron pipes and facilities in Chicago’s natural gas delivery system with modern polyethylene pipes to reinforce the long-term safety and reliability of the system. In November 2023, the ICC ordered PGL to pause spending on these projects until the ICC completed a proceeding to determine the optimal method for replacing aging natural gas infrastructure and a prudent investment level. In February 2025, the ICC issued an order setting expectations for PGL's prospective retirement of its aging natural gas infrastructure. The ICC directed us to focus on retiring all cast and ductile iron pipe that has a diameter of less than 36 inches by January 1, 2035. PGL will retire this cast and ductile iron pipe through its PRP.
