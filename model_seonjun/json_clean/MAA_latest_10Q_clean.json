The average effective rent per unit for our Same Store segment decreased to $1,693 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $1,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.4% decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. Average effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts, after the effect of leasing concessions, for occupied apartment units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied apartment units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. We believe average effective rent per unit is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing; however, it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, average physical occupancy for our Same Store segment was 95.6% as compared to 95.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Average physical occupancy is a measurement of the total number of our apartment units that are occupied by residents, and it represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the period.\nAs of September 30, 2025, resident turnover for our Same Store segment was 40.2% as compared to 42.8% as of September 30, 2024. Resident turnover represents resident move outs, excluding transfers within the Same Store segment, as a percentage of expiring leases on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of the reported period.\nAn important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and price points in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We have multifamily assets in 38 defined markets, with a presence in approximately 150 submarkets and a mixture of garden-style, mid-rise and high-rise communities. This diversity helps to mitigate exposure to economic issues, including supply and demand factors, in any one geographic market or area. We believe that a well-balanced portfolio, including both urban and suburban locations, with a broad range of monthly rent price points, will provide higher performance and lower volatility throughout the full economic cycle.\nDemand for apartments in our markets was solid during the third quarter of 2025, as evidenced by strong renewal pricing, solid traffic patterns and lead volumes along with stable occupancy and low resident turnover. We believe demand for apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets and is particularly correlated to job growth, population growth, household formation, in-migration and housing affordability over the long term. We continue to monitor pressures surrounding housing supply, inflation trends and general economic conditions. A worsening of the current environment could contribute to uncertain rent collections going forward, suppress demand for apartments and could drive lower rent growth on new leases and renewals than what we achieved in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. New supply delivering into several of our markets continues to be absorbed in a steady manner as the demand for apartment housing remains solid. We continue to believe that we will continue to see a decline in new apartment deliveries in calendar year 2026.\nAccess to the financial markets remains available for high-credit rated borrowers, such as ourselves. However, overall borrowing costs remain at elevated levels as compared to our in-place fixed rate debt, and we expect this trend to continue. As of September 30, 2025, we had $463.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding under our commercial paper program. Our continued exposure to elevated interest rates will be a result of additional variable rate borrowings and future financing activities.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the three months ended September 30, 2025 to the three months ended September 30, 2024\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, we achieved net income available for MAA common shareholders of $98.6 million, a 13.7% decrease as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, and total revenue growth of $3.2 million, representing a 0.6% increase\n\nThe following factors, among others, could cause our actual results, performance, achievements or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements:\nadverse effects on occupancy levels and rental revenues due to unfavorable market and economic conditions;\nexposure to risks inherent in investments in a single industry and sector;\nadverse changes in real estate markets, including the extent of future demand for multifamily units in our significant markets, barriers of entry into new markets which we may seek to enter in the future, limitations on our ability to increase or collect rental rates, competition, our ability to identify and consummate attractive acquisitions or development projects on favorable terms, our ability to consummate any planned dispositions in a timely manner on acceptable terms, and our ability to reinvest sale proceeds in a manner that generates favorable returns;\nfailure of development communities to be completed within budget and on a timely basis, if at all, to lease-up as anticipated or to achieve anticipated results;\nunexpected capital needs;\nmaterial changes in operating costs, including real estate taxes, utilities and insurance costs, due to inflation and other factors;\ninability to obtain appropriate insurance coverage at reasonable rates, or at all, losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles and self-insured retentions, or losses from catastrophes in excess of coverage limits;\nability to obtain financing at favorable rates, if at all, or refinance existing debt as it matures;\nlevel and volatility of interest or capitalization rates or capital market conditions;\nthe effect of any rating agency actions on the cost and availability of new debt financing;\nthe impact of adverse developments affecting the U.S. or global banking industry, including bank failures and liquidity concerns, which could cause continued or worsening economic and market volatility, and regulatory responses thereto;\nsignificant change in the mortgage financing market or other factors that would cause single-family housing or other alternative housing options, either as an owned or rental product, to become a more significant competitive product;\nability to continue to satisfy complex rules in order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the ability of the Operating Partnership to satisfy the rules to maintain its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the ability of our taxable REIT subsidiaries to maintain their status as such for federal income tax purposes, and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to operate effectively within the limitations imposed by these rules;\ninability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\ncyber liability or potential liability for breaches of our or our service providers’ information technology systems, or business operations disruptions;\npotential liability for environmental contamination;\nchanges in the legal requirements we are subject to, or the imposition of new legal requirements, that adversely affect our operations;\nextreme weather and natural disasters;\ndisease outbreaks and other public health events and measures that are taken by federal, state and local governmental authorities in response to such outbreaks and events;\nimpact of climate change on our properties or operations;\nlegal proceedings or class action lawsuits;\nimpact of reputational harm caused by negative press or social media postings of our actions or policies, whether or not warranted;\ncompliance costs associated with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations; and\nOverview of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, net income available for MAA common shareholders was $98.6 million as compared to $114.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
