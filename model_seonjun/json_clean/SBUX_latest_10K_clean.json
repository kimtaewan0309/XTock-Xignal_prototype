  "item1_clean": "Includes 113 licensed stores converted to company-operated stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 following the acquisition of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited.\nOther revenues primarily are recorded in our Channel Development segment and include sales of packaged coffee, tea, and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as royalties received from Nestlé under the Global Coffee Alliance and other collaborative partnerships.\nStarbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To help ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we generally control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting, and packaging, and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. Nestlé controls distribution of Starbucks packaged coffee products outside of Starbucks stores through the Global Coffee Alliance, and in some cases, also roasts and packages these products. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single-origin coffees.\nThe price of coffee is subject to volatility and has steadily increased over the past five years with significant increases over the last two years. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude\ncoffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather and extreme weather events, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, and political and economic conditions. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Price is also impacted by geopolitical conditions, including new and existing tariffs on coffee imports and other trade controls, and by trading activities in the\ncoffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies.\nWe buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts, and collars to hedge “C” price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2026.\nWe depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies, and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.\nTo help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields as well as agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts.\nIn addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote.\nProducts other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional, and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote.\nOur primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service, and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.\nOur coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and foodservice accounts and also compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.\nTrademarks, Copyrights, Patents, and Domain Names\nStarbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, and Frappuccino, are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\nWe own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems, and designs, which have an average remaining duration of approximately fifteen years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com,” “Starbucks.net,” and “Starbucksreserve.com.”\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to, and loaded by, customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Starbucks Cards, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations, and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations, and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\nAvailable Information\n\nStarbucks is the premier roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 89 markets. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “SBUX.” We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea, and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores (“stores” or “coffeehouses”). We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels, such as licensed stores as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé S.A. (“Nestlé”). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee\nbrand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana\n, and Starbucks Reserve\nOur primary objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. We believe the continuous investments in our brand and operations will deliver long-term targeted revenue and income growth. This includes expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S. and in higher growth markets, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the world. In addition, by leveraging experiences gained through our stores and elsewhere, we continue to drive beverage, equipment, process, and technology innovation, including in our industry-leading digital platform. We strive to regularly offer consumers new, innovative coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories and diverse channels.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we announced our\nstrategy, which was implemented with the goal to bring new and existing customers to our stores and business, and return to growth. The strategy\nincludes supporting our green apron partners, enhancing the customer experience, reestablishing ourselves as the community coffeehouse, and strengthening the brand through product development, marketing, in-store and digital experience. This strategic reset provides us with the opportunity to assess the business and refocus our efforts, including capital allocation priorities, efficiency efforts, and store growth initiatives.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we announced a restructuring plan involving the closure of coffeehouses, and the further transformation of our support organization, as part of the Company’s “Back to Starbucks” strategy. We assessed our existing store portfolio with respect to both whether coffeehouses had a viable path to offering the physical environment consistent with the brand and a clear path to financial performance and we closed, or plan to close, the coffeehouses that did not meet these criteria.\n, Restructuring, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe invest in the well-being – the mental, physical, and financial health – of every partner through our practices, policies, and benefits. This work is grounded in the belief that we are at our best when we create inclusive, supportive, and welcoming environments, where we uplift one another with dignity, respect, and kindness. We believe the strength of our workforce is one of",
  "item7_clean": "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified above, under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this 10-K, and elsewhere herein. Therefore, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 included 52 weeks.\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\nWe believe our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales, and operating margin management, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation. Comparable store sales\nincludes company-operated stores open 13 months or longer, and exclude the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. Stores that are temporarily closed remain in comparable store sales while permanent store closures are removed in the month following closure.\nWe believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\nNew store openings and store count\nComparable store sales\nStarbucks results for fiscal 2025 showed continued progress on key “Back to Starbucks” initiatives, specifically investments in coffeehouse partners, as we work to rebuild a stronger Starbucks. These investments include the Green Apron Service model, additional investments in staffing and hours at the right times to deliver enhanced customer service, and the Leadership Experience 2025, a conference designed to empower and motivate our retail leaders to accelerate our “Back to Starbucks” strategy. Consolidated net revenues increased 3% to $37.2 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $36.2 billion in fiscal 2024, primarily driven by incremental revenues from net new company-operated stores over the past 12 months, an increase in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance, and incremental revenue from the acquisition of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited, a U.K. licensed business partner, partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales and a decline in our licensed store business.\nFor both the North America segment and U.S. market, revenue increased 1% in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily driven by net new company-operated store growth of 4%\nor 441 stores, over the past 12 months, prior to the 584 North America restructuring closures late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. This growth was partially offset by a 2% decline in comparable store sales.\nComparable transactions declined\n, partially offset by average ticket growth of\n, primarily driven by annualization of pricing\nin the current year. Also contributing were lower product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees.\nFor the International segment, revenue increased 7% in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily driven by net new company-operated and licensed store openings over the past 12 months, incremental net revenue from the conversion of 113 licensed stores to company-operated stores following the acquisition of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, and higher product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees.\nRevenue for our Channel Development segment increased 6% in fiscal 2025 compared with fiscal 2024, primarily driven by an increase in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance.\nIn support of our “Back to Starbucks” strategy, we completed our assessment of our coffeehouse portfolio late in the fourth quarter and made decisions to close stores that did not demonstrate a viable path to profitability, or meet our standards of delivering a warm, welcoming space for our customers and partners. Our store closures in North America were substantially\ncompleted in fiscal 2025 and the International store closures are expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2026. As a result of these closures, we expect a fiscal 2026 reduction in our baseline North America company-operated revenues, partially offset by sales transfer to nearby coffeehouses that remain open. We also expect the future impact to operating margins to be slightly accretive. With a healthier base of coffeehouses, we see meaningful opportunity for disciplined growth. We anticipate that these actions, along with simplifying our broader support organization, will allow us to restructure, redeploy, and refocus our resources on priorities that we believe will deliver long-term sustainable business growth.\nWe expect that the macroeconomic challenges we have been experiencing, including impacts from new tariffs and dynamic coffee prices, will continue; however, we are encouraged by the results we have seen from our “Back to Starbucks” initiatives. Following our Green Apron Service model going live across our full U.S company-operated store portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we are focused on empowering coffeehouse leaders to take ownership of sustaining the model as our permanent way of working, which we expect to enhance the customer experience and drive future transaction growth. Further, as announced in early November 2025, we look forward to working with our new strategic joint venture partner, Boyu Capital, to accelerate long-term growth in China. We believe, through strategic prioritization, that we are taking the right actions now and in the future, specifically through our investments in store partners, uplifting the coffeehouse experience through disciplined capital deployment, introducing new food and beverage platforms, reimagining the Starbucks rewards program, and enhancing support for our licensee partners. These actions, while driving more efficiency, accountability, and agility as a company, will lay the foundation for the future of Starbucks.\nFinancial Highlights\nTotal net revenues increased 3% to\nin fiscal 2025 compared to $36.2 billion in fiscal 2024.\nConsolidated operating inco\nme decreased to $2.9 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $5.4 billion in fiscal 2024. Fiscal 2025 operating margin was 7.9% compared to 15.0% in fiscal 2024. Operating margin contraction of 710 basis points was primarily due to restructuring costs ass\nociated with the closure of coffeehouses and simplification of our support organization (approximately 240 basis points)\n, deleverage (approximately 210 basis points), investments in support of “Back to Starbucks,” which were largely in labor hours (approximately 130 basis points), and inflation (approximately 80 basis points).\nDiluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2025 declined to $1.63, compared to EPS of $3.31 in fiscal 2024.\nThe decrease was primarily driven by contraction in operating margin, including restructuring and impairment costs in support of our “Back to Starbucks” strategy, as compared to the prior year.\nCapital expenditures were $2.3 billion in fiscal 2025 and $2.8 billion in fiscal 2024.\nand $3.8 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively, through dividends and share repurchases.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2025 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2024\nConsolidated results of operations\nCompany-operated stores\n\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOperating lease obligations\nPurchase obligations\nAmounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance, and other related expenses.\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 88% of total purchase obligations.\nOther obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of long-term asset retirement obligations, income taxes payable, equity investment capital commitments, and finance lease obligations.\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.7 billion for fiscal 2025, compared to $6.1 billion for fiscal 2024. The change was primarily due to the decrease in net earnings of $1.9 billion and a net increase of $451.2 million in inventories, which was primarily driven by green and roasted coffee, largely due to elevated coffee prices. These impacts were partially offset by a net increase of $713.2 million in loss on disposal, impairment, and accelerated amortization of assets primarily driven by restructuring costs as part of the “Back to Starbucks” strategy and a net increase in accounts payable, primarily due to payment timing.\nCash used in investing activities was $2.5 billion for fiscal 2025, compared to $2.7 billion for fiscal 2024. The change was primarily due to a net decrease in capital expenditures of $472.0 million driven by a reduction in retail store investments and renovations in North America. These increases were partially offset by the acquisition of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited.\nCash used in financing activities was $2.3 billion for fiscal 2025, compared to $3.7 billion for fiscal 2024. The change was primarily due to no current year share repurchases of our common stock compared to the prior year.\nCOMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY, AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS\nCommodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality\ncoffee and related products, and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities, including impacts from volatility in green coffee prices and new tariffs, directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to continue to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-K, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this 10-K.\nFINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually, and speculative trading activities are prohibited. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value of our net investments in foreign operations. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments and cross currency swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to\n, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, and\n, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.\nThe sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar, and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts and financial derivatives, to manage our commodity price risk exposure.\nThe following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 28, 2025, to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the derivative hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items\n\nDecrease in Fair Value for a 100 Basis Point Increase in Underlying Rate\nAmount disclosed is net of\nin the fair value of our designated interest rate swaps. Refer to\n, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 28, 2025, and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nOur significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in\n, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. We b",
