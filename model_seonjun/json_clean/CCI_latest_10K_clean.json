We seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our shared communications infrastructure, which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our low incremental operating costs. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See\n\"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\"\nand notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOver nearly three decades, we have assembled a leading portfolio of towers predominately through acquisitions from large wireless carriers or their predecessors. More recently, we have extended our communications infrastructure presence by investing significantly in our Fiber segment. Through our product offerings of towers and small cells, we seek to provide a comprehensive solution to enable our wireless tenants to expand coverage and capacity for their wireless networks. Furthermore, within our Fiber segment, we seek to generate cash flow growth and stockholder return by deploying our fiber for both small cells' and fiber solutions' tenants.\nApproximately 56% and 71% of our towers are located in the 50 and 100 largest U.S. basic trading areas (\"BTAs\"), respectively. Our towers have a significant presence in each of the top 100 BTAs. We derive approximately 40% of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we own, including through fee interests and perpetual easements, and we derive approximately 60% of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we lease, sublease, manage or license. The contracts for the land under our towers have an average total remaining life of approximately 35 years (including all renewal terms exercisable at our option), weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. The majority of our small cells and fiber assets are located in major metropolitan areas, including a presence in most major U.S. markets. The vast majority of our fiber assets are located on public rights-of-way.\nOur largest tenants are T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless, which collectively accounted for approximately three-fourths of our 2024 consolidated site rental revenues. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants. Site rental revenues represented 97% of our 2024 consolidated net revenues, of which 67% and 33% were from our Towers segment and Fiber segment, respectively. Within our Fiber segment, 66% and 34% of our 2024 site rental revenues related to fiber solutions and small cells, respectively. The vast majority of our site rental revenues are of a recurring nature and are derived from long-term tenant contracts. See \"\nItem 1. Business—The Company\n\" for further information. As of December 31, 2024, exclusive of renewals exercisable at the tenants' option, our tenant contracts had a weighted-average remaining life of approximately six years and represented $35.9 billion of expected future cash inflows.\nAs part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, we also offer certain services primarily relating to our Towers segment, predominately consisting of pre-construction site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations, including: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting (collectively, \"site development services\").\nSee note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the July 2023 restructuring (\"2023 Restructuring Plan\"), which included discontinuing tenant equipment installations and subsequent augmentations (collectively, \"installation services\") as a Towers product offering and (2) the June 2024 restructuring plan (\"2024 Restructuring Plan,\" and together with the 2023 Restructuring Plan, \"Restructuring Plans\").\nAs a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the U.S., our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our existing portfolio of communications infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our common stockholders in the form of dividends and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. Our strategy is based, in part, on our belief that the U.S. is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest long-term growth potential. We measure our efforts to create \"long-term stockholder value\" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per-share results. The key elements of our strategy are to:\nGrow cash flows from our existing communications infrastructure.\nWe are focused on maximizing the recurring site rental cash flows generated from providing our tenants with long-term access to our shared infrastructure assets, which we believe is the core driver of value for our stockholders. Tenant additions or modifications of existing tenant equipment (collectively, \"tenant additions\") enable our tenants to expand coverage and capacity in order to meet increasing demand for data while generating high incremental returns for our business. We believe our product offerings of towers and small cells through our shared communications infrastructure model provide a comprehensive, efficient and cost-effective solution for our wireless tenants' growing networks. Additionally, we believe our ability to share our fiber assets across multiple tenants to both deploy small cells and offer fiber solutions allows us to generate cash flows and increase stockholder return.\nReturn cash generated by operating activities to common stockholders in the form of dividends\n. We believe that distributing a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities appropriately provides common stockholders with increased certainty for a portion of expected long-term stockholder value while still allowing us to retain sufficient flexibility to invest in our business and deliver growth. We believe this decision reflects the translation of the high-quality, long-term contractual cash flows of our business into stable capital returns to common stockholders.\nInvest capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share.\nIn addition to adding tenants to existing communications infrastructure, we seek to invest our available capital, including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources, in a manner that will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. These investments include constructing and acquiring new communications infrastructure that we expect will generate future cash flow growth and attractive long-term returns by adding tenants to those assets over time. Our historical investments have included the following (in no particular order):\nconstruction of towers, fiber and small cells;\nacquisitions of towers, fiber and small cells;\nacquisitions of land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers);\nimprovements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure;\npurchases of shares of our common stock from time to time; and\npurchases, repayments or redemptions of our debt.\nOur strategy to create long-term stockholder value is based on our belief that there will be considerable future demand for our communications infrastructure based on the location of our assets and the rapid and continuing growth in the demand for data. We believe that such demand for our communications infrastructure will continue, will result in growth of our cash flows due to tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure, and will create other growth opportunities for us, such as demand for newly constructed or acquired communications infrastructure, as described above. Further, we seek to augment the long-term value creation associated with growing our recurring site rental cash flows by offering certain ancillary site development services within our Towers segment.\nWe operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and, therefore, are not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. We may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income or assets, including (1) taxes on any undistributed income, (2) taxes related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\"), (3) franchise taxes, (4) property taxes and (5) transfer taxes. In addition, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"), to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. For taxable years beginning before 2026, qualified REIT dividends (within the meaning of Section 199A(e)(3) of the Code) constitute a part of a non-corporate taxpayer's \"qualified business income amount\" and thus our non-corporate U.S. stockholders may be eligible to take a qualified business income deduction in an amount equal to 20% of such dividends received from us. Without further legislative action, the 20% deduction applicable to qualified REIT dividends will expire on January 1, 2026.\nThe vast majority of our assets and revenues are in the REIT. See notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we have included in TRSs certain other assets and operations. Those TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located.\nOur foreign assets and operations (including our tower operations in Puerto Rico) most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located, regardless of whether or not they are included in a TRS.\nTo remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we are generally required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, after the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards \"NOLs\" (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) (see notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements). Our quarterly common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our NOLs and may cause certain of the NOLs to expire without utilization. See\n\"Item 1A. Risk Factors\"\nfor risks associated with our REIT status.\nConsumer demand for data continues to grow due to increases in data consumption and increased penetration of bandwidth-intensive devices. This increase in data consumption is driven by factors such as growth in (1) mobile entertainment (such as mobile video, mobile applications and social networking), (2) mobile internet usage (supporting web browsing and trends in telehealth, remote working, online learning and other remote communications), (3) machine-to-machine applications or the \"Internet of Things\" (such as connected cars and wearables), and (4) the adoption of other bandwidth-intensive applications (such as cloud services, artificial intelligence and video communications). As a result, consumer wireless devices are trending toward bandwidth-intensive devices, including smartphones, laptops, tablets and other emerging and embedded devices, and U.S. wireless carriers are among the first carriers in the world to offer commercial 5th Generation (\"5G\") mobile cellular communications services to further support such growth.\nWe expect the following fact",
  "item7_clean": "Represents site rental revenues growth from tenant additions across our entire portfolio and renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, exclusive of the impacts from both straight-line accounting and amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP and change in payments for Sprint Cancellations.\nIncludes $9 million of non-renewals associated with Sprint Cancellations.\nRepresents $170 million of payments associated with Sprint Cancellations received in 2023 and not recurring in 2024, which were partially offset by approximately $5 million of payments associated with Sprint Cancellations received in 2024.\nPrepaid rent amortization includes amortization of upfront payments received from long-term tenants and other deferred credits. Prepaid rent amortization includes $59 million of accelerated prepaid rent amortization associated with the Sprint Cancellations that was recognized in 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\nTowers site rental revenues and Towers Adjusted Site Rental Gross Margin for 2024 were $4.3 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, compared to $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, from 2023. The decrease of $47 million and $63 million in Towers site rental revenue and Towers Adjusted Site Rental Gross Margin, respectively, was primarily due to a decrease in prepaid rent amortization, as new leasing activity and contractual cash escalators were substantially offset by a decline in the associated straight-line accounting adjustment.\nFiber site rental revenues and Fiber Adjusted Site Rental Gross Margin for 2024 were $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, and decreased by $127 million and $175 million, respectively, from 2023. Both Fiber site rental revenues and Fiber Adjusted Site Rental Gross Margin were predominately impacted by a $165 million reduction in site rental revenues and an absence of $59 million of accelerated prepaid rent amortization, both related to Sprint Cancellations, which were partially offset by increased demand for small cells and fiber solutions.\nTowers Adjusted Services and Other Gross Margin was $91 million for 2024 and decreased by $36 million from $127 million from 2023, which is a reflection of (1) the lower volume of activity from carriers' network enhancements, (2) the volume and mix of services and other work and (3) the discontinuation of installation services as a Towers product offering. Our services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term tenant contracts. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the 2023 Restructuring Plan, which included discontinuing installation services as a Towers product offering.\nFiber Adjusted Services and Other Gross Margin was $6 million for 2024 and decreased by $10 million from $16 million from 2023 primarily as a result of the absence of payments received for site abandonment fees associated with the Sprint Cancellations that were received during 2023.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2024 were $706 million and decreased by $53 million, or 7%, from $759 million from 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to a decrease in employee- and facility-related costs as a result of our aforementioned restructuring activities, which was partially offset by an increase in advisory fees, mostly stemming from our recent proxy contest and the Fiber strategic review.\nAsset write-down charges for 2024 increased by $115 million, or 348% from 2023. The increase was primarily related to the $106 million charge due to the cancellation of approximately 7,000 greenfield small cell nodes in our contracted backlog, as was mutually agreed upon with certain of our tenants. See\n\"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview\"\nfor additional information.\nTowers operating profit (loss) for 2024 decreased by $71 million, or 2%, from 2023. The decrease in Towers operating profit (loss) was primarily related to the previously-mentioned decreases in both Towers Adjusted Site Rental Gross Margin and Towers Adjusted Services and Other Gross Margin, which were partially offset by a decrease in Towers selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of the 2023 Restructuring Plan.\nFiber operating profit (loss) for 2024 decreased by $167 million, or 12%, from 2023. The decrease in Fiber operating profit (loss) was primarily related to the previously-mentioned decreases in both Fiber Adjusted Site Rental Gross Margin and Fiber Adjusted Services and Other Gross Margin, which were partially offset by a decrease in Fiber selling, general and administrative expenses following the 2024 Restructuring Plan.\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion was approximately $1.7 billion for 2024 and decreased by $16 million, or 1%, from 2023. This decrease predominately resulted from certain site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets becoming fully amortized.\nRestructuring charges in connection with the Restructuring Plans for 2024 were $109 million and increased by $24 million, or 28%, from $85 million in 2023. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in office closure or consolidation costs in connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, when compared to the 2023 Restructuring Plan. This increase was partially offset by lower employee headcount reduction charges in connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, when compared to the 2023 Restructuring Plan. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our Restructuring Plans.\nGoodwill impairment charges of $5.0 billion were recorded for our Fiber reporting unit for 2024. See\n\"Item 7. MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\"\nand note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, net was $932 million for 2024 and increased by $82 million, or 10%, from $850 million during 2023. The increase predominately resulted from an increase in our outstanding indebtedness due to the financing of our discretionary capital expenditures. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements,\n\"Item 1A. Risk Factors\"\n\"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\"\nfor a further discussion of our debt and interest rate exposure.\nThe provisions for income taxes for 2024 and 2023 were $24 million and $26 million, respectively. For both 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our REIT status, including the dividends paid deduction. See\n\"Item 1. Business—REIT Status,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\"\nand note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nNet income (loss) was $(3.9) billion during 2024 compared to $1.5 billion during 2023. The decrease was related to the previously-mentioned decreases in Towers and Fiber operating profits, the previously-mentioned increases in goodwill impairment charges, asset write-down charges and interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, net, while being partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $254 million, or 6%, from 2023 to 2024, reflecting the previously mentioned decreases in Towers and Fiber operating profits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur core business generates revenues under long-term tenant contracts (see\n\"Item 1. Business—Overview\"\n\"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Overview\"\n) from (1) the largest U.S. wireless carriers and (2) other towers and fiber solutions tenants. As a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the U.S., our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of communications infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends, and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. Our strategy is based, in part, on our belief that the U.S. is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest long-term growth potential. We measure our efforts to create \"long-term stockholder value\" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results. See\n\"Item 1. Business—Strategy\"\nfor a further discussion of our strategy.\nWe have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize long-term stockholder value. Our historical discretionary investments include (in no particular order): constructing communications infrastructure, acquiring communications infrastructure, acquiring land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers), improving and structurally enhancing our existing communications infrastructure, purchasing shares of our common stock, and purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. We have recently spent, and expect to continue to spend, a significant percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of small cells and fiber through the closing of the sale of the Fiber Business. See \"\nItem 1. Business—Overview\n\" for further detail. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and \"\nItem 2. MD&A—Results of Operations\n\" for further discussion of the 2024 Restructuring Plan, which resulted in, among other things, an increase in return thresholds on new growth opportunities in the Fiber segment and a reduction in Fiber segment capital expenditures for full year 2024. We seek to fund our discretionary investments with both cash generated by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity, such as the use of our availability under our 2016 Revolver, issuances under our CP Program, debt financings and issuances of equity or equity-related securities, including under our 2024 ATM Program or any similar successor program.\nWe seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives long-term stockholder value and optimizes our weighted-average cost of capital. Additionally, we expect to maintain an investment grade credit profile. Our contractual debt maturities over the next 12 months, consist of (1) Commercial Paper Notes, of which we had $1.1 billion outstanding as of March 12, 2025, (2) the 1.350% senior unsecured notes due July 2025 (\"1.350% Senior Notes\") and (3) principal payments on certain outstanding debt. We currently expect to refinance $700 million of Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 on or prior to the anticipated repayment date on May 15, 2025. Amounts available under our CP Program may be repaid and re-issued from time to time and we intend to maintain available commitments under our 2016 Revolver in an amount at least equal to the amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding.\nWe operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our REIT status and our NOLs. See\n\"Item 1. Business—REIT Status,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview\"\nand note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position as of December 31, 2024. See\n\"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\"\nand note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt as well as note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our 2024 ATM Program.\n(In millions of dollars)\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents\nUndrawn 2016 Revolver availability\nTotal debt and other obligations (current and non-current)\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe own, operate and lease shared communications infrastructure. See\nfor a further discussion of our business, including our long-term strategy, our REIT status, certain key terms of our tenant contracts and growth trends in the demand for data.\nOn March 13, 2025, management signed the Strategic Fiber Agreement to sell our Fiber Business, with Zayo acquiring the fiber solutions business and EQT acquiring the small cell business. Under the Strategic Fiber Agreement, we will receive $8.5 billion in aggregate, subject to certain closing adjustments. The Strategic Fiber Transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026, subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals. See\n\"Item 1. Business—Overview\"\nfor further discussion of the pending sale of the Fiber Business.\nThe Fiber Business did not meet the criteria for assets held for sale as of December 31, 2024, and therefore remains presented as a component of continuing operations. As a result, this document, unless otherwise noted, does not contemplate the planned sale of the Fiber Business.\nHighlights of Business Fundamentals and Results\nSite rental revenues represented 97% of our 2024 consolidated net revenues. The vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in prior years.\nWe operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes (see\n\"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\"\nand notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements)\nPotential growth resulting from the increasing demand for data\nWe expect existing and potential new tenant demand for our communications infrastructure will result from (1) new technologies, (2) increased usage of mobile entertainment, mobile internet, and machine-to-machine applications, (3) adoption of other emerging and embedded wireless devices (including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables and other devices), (4) increasing smartphone penetration, (5) wireless carrier focus on expanding both network quality and capacity, including the use of both towers and small cells, (6) the adoption of other bandwidth-intensive applications (such as cloud services, artificial intelligence and video communications), (7) the availability of additional spectrum and (8) increased government initiatives to support connectivity throughout the U.S.\nWe expect U.S. wireless carriers will continue to focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity (including through 5G initiatives) by utilizing a combination of towers and small cells. We believe our product offerings of towers and small cells provide a comprehensive solution to our wireless tenants' growing communications infrastructure needs.\nWe expect organizations will continue to increase the usage of high-bandwidth applications that will require the utilization of more fiber infrastructure and fiber solutions, such as those we provide.\nWithin our Fiber segment, we are able to generate growth and returns for our stockholders by deploying our fiber for both small cells and fiber solutions tenants.\nTenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure are achieved at a low incremental operating cost, delivering high incremental returns.\nSubstantially all of our communications infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications.\nReturning cash flows provided by operations to stockholders in the form of dividends (see also\n\"Item 1.
