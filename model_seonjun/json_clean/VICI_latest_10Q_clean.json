Our cash flows from operations and our ability to access capital resources could be adversely affected due to uncertain economic factors and volatility in the financial and credit markets, including as a result of the current interest rate environment, inflationary pressures, equity market volatility, and changes in consumer behavior and spending. In particular, we can provide no assurances that our tenants will not default on their leases or fail to make full rental payments if their businesses become challenged due to, among other things, current or future adverse economic conditions. See “Overview — Impact of Material Trends on our Business” above for additional detail. In the event our tenants are unable to make all of their contractual rent payments as provided by our lease agreements, we believe we have sufficient liquidity from the other sources discussed above to meet all of our contractual obligations for a significant period of time. For more information, refer to the risk factors incorporated by reference into\nPart II. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur ability to raise funds through the issuance of debt and equity securities and access to other third-party sources of capital in the future will be dependent on, among other things, general economic conditions, general market conditions for REITs and investment grade issuers, market perceptions, the trading price of our stock, the trading value of our unsecured debt and uncertainties related to the macroeconomic environment. We will continue to analyze which sources of capital are most advantageous to us at any particular point in time and with respect to any specific funding requirements, but financing through the capital markets may not be consistently available on terms we deem attractive, or at all.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nOur short-term obligations consist primarily of regular interest payments on our debt obligations, dividends to our common stockholders, distributions to the VICI OP Unit holders, Lucky Strike OP Units holders and to the 20% third-party owners of Harrah’s Joliet LandCo LLC, normal recurring operating expenses, recurring expenditures for corporate and administrative needs, certain lease and other contractual commitments related to our golf operations and certain non-recurring expenditures. For more information on our material contractual commitments, refer to\nNote 10 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nOur long-term obligations consist primarily of principal payments on our outstanding debt obligations and future funding commitments under our lease and loan agreements. As of September 30, 2025, we had $17.1 billion of debt obligations outstanding, of which $500.0 million matures on September 1, 2026. For a summary of principal debt balances and their\nmaturity dates and principal terms, refer to\n. For a summary of our future funding commitments under our loan portfolio, refer to\nNote 4 - Real Estate Portfolio\nPursuant to our lease agreements, capital expenditures, insurance and taxes for our properties are the responsibility of the tenants. Minimum capital expenditure spending requirements of the tenants pursuant to our gaming lease agreements are described in\nNote 4 - Real Estate Portfolio\nInformation concerning our material contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts such as our indebtedness, future funding commitments under our loans and Partner Property Growth Fund strategy and future contractual operating commitments (such as future lease payments under our corporate lease) are included in the following table as of September 30, 2025. Amounts in this table omit, among other things, non-contractual commitments and items such as dividends and recurring or non-recurring operating expenses and other expenditures, including acquisitions and other investments:\nPayments Due By Period\nLong-term debt, principal\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nMGM Grand/Mandalay Bay CMBS Debt\nRevolving Credit Facility\nScheduled interest payments\nTotal debt contractual obligations\nLeases and contracts\nFuture funding commitments – loan investments\nGolf course operating lease and contractual commitments\nCorporate office leases\nTotal leases and contractual obligations\nTotal contractual commitments\n____________________\n(1) Estimated interest payments on variable interest debt under our Revolving Credit Facility are based on the applicable SOFR, CORRA and SONIA rates as of September 30, 2025.\n(2) Excludes ground and use leases which are paid directly by our tenants to the primary lease holder.\n(3) The allocation of our future funding commitments is based on construction draw schedules, commitment funding dates, expiration dates or other information, as applicable; however, we may be obligated to fund these commitments earlier than such applicable date.\nAdditional Funding Requirements\nIn addition to the contractual obligations and commitments set forth in the table above, we have and may enter into additional agreements that commit us to potentially acquire properties in the future, fund future property improvements or otherwise provide capital to our tenants, borrowers and other counterparties, including through our Partner Property Growth Fund strategy. As of September 30, 2025, we had $300.0 million of additional potential future funding commitments in connection with the Venetian Capital Investment entered into on May 1, 2024, pursuant to which the tenant has the option, but not the obligation, to draw our future funds, prior to November 1, 2026. The utilization of funding commitments under the Partner Property Growth Fund strategy, as well as the total funding ultimately provided under such arrangements, is at the discretion of the respective tenant and will be dependent upon independent decisions made by such tenant with respect to any capital improvement projects and the source of funds for such projects.\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nProvided by operating activities\nUsed in investing activities\nUsed in financing activities\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $80.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by the annual rent escalators on certain of our lease agreements and the incremental rent increases from the Venetian Capital Investment (which occurred in July 2024, October 2024 and January 2025), as well as the incremental interest income associated with additional loan fundings and originations.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $102.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the primary sources and uses of cash from investing activities included:\nDisbursements to fund investments in our loan and securities portfolio in the amount of $786.4 million; and\nProceeds from the partial repayment of the Cabot Saint Lucia and Homefield loans and the Hard Rock Ottawa Notes and deferred fees in the amount of\nnine months ended September 30, 2024\n, the primary sources and uses of cash from investing activities included:\nDisbursements to fund investments in our loan and securities portfolio in the amount of\nPayments to fund the Venetian Capital Investment and Property Growth Fund investment at Caruthersville in the amount of\nProceeds from the repayment of the Great Wolf Lodge Maryland mezzanine loan in the amount of\nInvestments and maturities of short-term investments of\nPayments for property and equipment costs of $6.4 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $172.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the primary sources and uses of cash in financing activities included:\nNet p"
