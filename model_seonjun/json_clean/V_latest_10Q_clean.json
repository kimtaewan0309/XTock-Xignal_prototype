Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.\nFor a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in\nNon-GAAP financial results\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2025, net revenue increased 14% and 11% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily due to the growth in processed transactions, nominal cross-border volume and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, exchange rate movements did not have a material impact on net revenue growth. For the nine months ended June 30, 2025, exchange rate movements lowered our net revenue growth by approximately one percentage point. See\nResults of Operations—Net Revenue\nbelow for further discussion.\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2025, operating expenses increased 35% and 26% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily driven by higher litigation provision and personnel expenses. See\nResults of Operations—Operating Expenses\nbelow for further discussion. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2025, exchange rate movements lowered our operating expense growth by approximately half a percentage point and one percentage point, respectively.\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2025, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 13% and 10% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily driven by higher personnel, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expenses.\nIn May 2025, we issued Euro-denominated fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of €3.5 billion ($3.9 billion), with maturities ranging between 3 and 19 years. See\nto our unaudited consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2024, we acquired Featurespace Limited (Featurespace), a developer of real-time artificial intelligence payments protection technology that prevents and mitigates payments fraud and financial crime risks, for a purchase consideration of $946 million. See\nto our unaudited consolidated financial statements.\nInterchange multidistrict litigation\n. For the nine months ended June 30, 2025, we recorded additional accruals of $1.5 billion to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also made deposits of $375 million into the U. S. litigation escrow account. The additional accruals related to the interchange multidistrict litigation could be higher or lower than deposits made into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See\nNote 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans\nNote 13—Legal Matters\nto our unaudited consolidated financial statements.\nCommon stock repurchases.\nIn April 2025, our board of directors authorized a $30.0 billion share repurchase program, providing multi-year flexibility. For the nine months ended June 30, 2025, we repurchased 40 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $13.2 billion. As of June 30, 2025, our share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $29.8 billion. See\nNote 9—Stockholders’ Equity\nto our unaudited consolidated financial statements.\nNon-GAAP financial results.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance.\nGains and losses on equity investments.\nGains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment.\n\nand therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as technology and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance.\nAcquisition-related costs.\nAcquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2025, we recorded severance costs within personnel expense to realign our organizational structure and focus on areas that will drive higher long-term growth. This broad-based optimization effort has been excluded as it is not representative of our ongoing operations.\nLease consolidation costs.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, we recorded charges within general and administrative expense associated with the consolidation of certain leased office spaces. We have excluded these amounts as it does not reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nLitigation provision.\nLitigation provision includes significant accruals related to certain legal matters that are not covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan or the Europe retrospective responsibility plan (uncovered legal matters) and additional accruals associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation which are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan (U.S. covered litigation). Litigation provision associated with these matters can vary significantly based on the facts and circumstances related to each matter and do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, we have excluded these amounts to facilitate a comparison to our past operating performance.\nUnder the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B-1 and class B-2 common stock ultimately convert into shares of class A common stock. For the three months ended June\n30, 2025 and the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, there was no conversion rate adjustment. For the nine months ended June 30, 2025, basic and diluted earnings per class A common stock was unchanged. See\nNote 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans\nNote 13—Legal Matters\nto our unaudited consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, as a result of the resolution of an audit, we recognized a benefit within general and administrative expense related to the release of the reserve previously recognized in fiscal 2021. This one-time benefit is not representative of our ongoing operations.\nCharitable contribution.\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, we donated investment securities to the Visa Foundation and recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense. We have excluded this amount as it does not reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The following tables reconcile our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures:\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nIncome Tax Provision\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n(in millions, except percentages and per share data)\nGAAP\n(Gains) losses on equity investments, net\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\nAcquisition-related costs\nLitigation provision\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nIncome Tax Provision\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n(in millions, except percentages and per share data)\nGAAP\n(Gains) losses on equity investments, net\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\nAcquisition-related costs\nLease consolidation costs\nLitigation provision\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nIncome Tax Provision\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n(in millions, except percentages and per share data)\nGAAP\n(Gains) losses on equity investments, net\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\nAcquisition-related costs\nLitigation provision\nCharitable contribution\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nIncome Tax Provision\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n(in millions, except percentages and per share data)\nGAAP\n(Gains) losses on equity investments, net\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\nAcquisition-related costs\nLitigation provision\nLease consolidation costs\nCharitable contribution\nDetermined by applying applicable tax rates.\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers.\nPayments volume and processed transactions.\nPayments volume is the primary driver for our service revenue, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenue.\n\nPayments volume growth\nConsumer credit growth\n"
