  "item1_clean": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nD.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes closed. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in 126 markets across 36 states. Our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NYSE Texas under the ticker symbol “DHI.” Our listing on NYSE Texas became effective in June 2025. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “D.R. Horton,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.\nOur homebuilding business began in 1978 in Fort Worth, Texas, and our common stock has been publicly traded since 1992. We have expanded and diversified our homebuilding operations geographically over the years by investing capital and building teams of people in our existing markets, starting new operations in additional markets and acquiring other homebuilding companies. We have closed more than 1.2 million homes during our 47-year history, and we have been the largest volume homebuilder in the United States every year since 2002.\nOur business operations consist of homebuilding, rental, a majority-owned residential lot development company, financial services and other activities. Homebuilding is our core business, generating 92% of consolidated revenues of $34.3 billion and $36.8 billion in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 90% of consolidated revenues of $35.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Most of our homebuilding revenue is generated from the sale of completed homes and to a lesser extent from the sale of land and lots. Approximately 84% of our home sales revenue in fiscal 2025 was generated from the sale of single-family detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as townhomes and duplexes. Our product offerings include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury buyers. Our homes generally range in size from 1,000 to 4,000 square feet and in price from $250,000 to more than $1,000,000. For the year ended September 30, 2025, our homebuilding operations closed 84,863 homes with an average closing price of $370,400.\nOur rental segment consists of single-family and multi-family rental operations. The single-family rental operations construct and lease single-family homes within a community and market each community for a bulk sale of rental homes. The multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and sell residential rental properties, the majority of which are apartment communities. For the year ended September 30, 2025, our rental operations closed 3,460 single-family rental homes and 2,947 multi-family rental units.\nAt September 30, 2025, we owned 62% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar), a publicly traded residential lot development company listed on the NYSE and NYSE Texas under the ticker symbol “FOR.” Forestar operates across many of our homebuilding operating markets and is a key part of our homebuilding strategy to maintain relationships with land developers and control a large portion of our land and lot position through land purchase contracts. For the year ended September 30, 2025, Forestar sold 14,240 lots, of which 83% were sold to D.R. Horton.\nOur financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our wholly owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuyers and sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers after origination. For the year ended September 30, 2025, DHI Mortgage originated or brokered 68,982 mortgage loans. Our wholly owned subsidiary title companies issue title insurance policies and provide examination, underwriting and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers.\nIn addition to our homebuilding, rental, Forestar and financial services operations, we engage in other business activities through our subsidiaries. We conduct insurance-related operations, own water rights and other water-related assets and own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements. The results of these operations are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped together and presented as other.\nAvailable Information\nOPERATING STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES\nFollowing is an overview of our company’s operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls, strategies and performance.\nHomebuilding Markets\nOur homebuilding business operates in 126 markets across 36 states, which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings. We believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles, and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business and provide a strong platform for us to consolidate market share.\nWe conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions, states and markets listed below. Our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments, also referred to as reporting regions, which comprise the markets below. Our financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance.\nReporting Region/Market\nReporting Region/Market\nReporting Region/Market\nCape Coral/Fort Myers\nSalt Lake City/Provo/Ogden\nDeltona/Daytona Beach\nIowa City/Cedar Rapids\nKennewick/Pasco/Richland\nMiami/Fort Lauderdale\nSeattle/Tacoma/Everett/Olympia\nSuburban Washington, D.C.\nMinneapolis/St. Paul\nTampa/Sarasota/Punta Gorda\nCentral Pennsylvania\nLake Charles/Lafayette\nModesto/Merced/Stockton\nRedding/Chico/Yuba City\nVirginia Beach/Williamsburg\nSan Bernardino County\nEastern West Virginia\nNorthern West Virginia\nSouth Central Region\nGreensboro/Winston-Salem\nRaleigh/Durham/Fayetteville\nGreenville/Spartanburg\nBryan/College Station\nNew Braunfels/San Marcos\nWhen evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation, we consider local, market-specific factors, including among others:\nEconomic conditions;\nEmployment levels and job growth;\nIncome level of potential homebuyers;\nLocal housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized;\nDemand for homes at our targeted price points;\nAvailability of land and lots in desirable locations on acceptable terms;\nLand entitlement and development processes;\nAvailability of qualified subcontractors;\nNew and secondary home sales activity;\nPrevailing housing products, features, cost and pricing; and\nPerformance capabilities of our local management team.\nWe are the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes closed in fiscal 2025, and we are also one of the largest builders in most of the markets in which we operate. We believe that our national, regional and local scale provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders, such as:\nGreater access to and lower cost of capital due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital markets relationships;\nVolume discounts and rebates from national, regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors; and\nEnhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities, which allows us flexibility to adjust to changes in market conditions and compete effectively across our markets.\nDecentralized Homebuilding Operations\nWe view homebuilding as a local business; therefore, most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers in making operational decisions. We believe that our local management teams, who are familiar with local market conditions, have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations. At September 30, 2025, we had 92 separate homebuilding operating divisions, many of which operate in more than one market area. Generally, each operating division consists of a division president; a controller and accounting personnel; land entitlement, acquisition and development personnel; a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel; a construction manager and construction superintendents; customer service personnel; a purchasing manager and office staff. Our division presidents receive performance-based compensation for achieving targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions. Following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices.\nOperating Division Responsibilities\nEach homebuilding operating division is responsible for:\nSite selection, which involves\n— A feasibility study;\n— Soil and environmental reviews;\n— Review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements;\n— Review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements and to complete necessary infrastructure; and\n— Financial analysis of the potential project;\nNegotiating lot purchase, land acquisition and related contracts;\nObtaining all necessary land development and home construction approvals;\nSelecting subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;\nSelecting building and architectural plans;\nPlanning and managing home construction schedules;\nDetermining the pricing for each house plan and options in a given community;\nDeveloping and implementing local marketing and sales plans;\nCoordinating all interactions with customers and real estate brokers during the sales, construction and home closing processes; and\nEnsuring the quality and timeliness of post-closing service and warranty repairs provided to customers.\nCentralized Controls\nWe centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices. We have separate homebuilding regional offices, which generally consist of a region president, a chief financial officer, legal counsel and other operational and office support staff. Each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions, including:\nReview and approval of division business plans and budgets;\nReview and approval of all land and lot acquisition contracts;\nReview of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments;\nOversight of land and home inventory levels;\nMonitoring division financial and operating performance; and\nReview of major personnel decisions and division incentive compensation plans.\nOur corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations. The corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions:\nAllocation of capital;\nIssuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines;\nApproval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;\nMonitoring and analysis of profitability, returns, costs and inventory levels;\nEnvironmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;\nRisk and litigation management;\nTechnology systems to support management of operations, marketing and financial information, including preventing, monitoring and reporting of cybersecurity issues;\nAccounting and management reporting;\nPublic financial reporting and investor and media relations;\nAdministration of payroll and employee benefits;\nNegotiation of national purchasing contracts;\nAdministration",

Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, and for the years ended September 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023. Each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n— We generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. Our performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. Proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWhen we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.\nRevenues associated with our mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights. We typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold. Expected gains and losses from the sale of loans, adjusted for (i) estimated costs to complete and originate the loan and (ii) the estimated percentage of written loan commitments that will result in a closed mortgage loan, are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment. We sell substantially all of the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. Interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.\nMortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions, which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses. Based on historical experience, analysis of the volume of mortgages we originated, discussions with our mortgage purchasers and current housing and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale, as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests.\nInventories and Cost of Sales\n— Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and construction. Costs that we incur after projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance and cleaning, are charged to SG&A expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred.\nLand and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. Home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community. Cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot in the community. Any changes to the estimated total development costs after the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity.\nWhen a home is closed, we generally have not paid all of the incurred costs necessary to complete the home. We record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed. We compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals, such differences have not been significant.\nAt the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment. We generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level, and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development, residential land and lots developed and under development, land held for sale, rental properties and construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale. A particular community often includes inventory in more than one category. In certain situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans. In reviewing each of our communities, we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following:\ngross margins on homes closed in recent months;\nprojected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;\nprojected gross margins based on community budgets;\nprojected gross margins of rental property sales;\ntrends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;\nsales absorption rates; and\nperformance of other communities in nearby locations.\nIf indicators of impairment are present for a community, we perform an impairment evaluation of the community, which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If so, impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local market conditions:\nsupply and availability of new and existing homes;\nlocation and desirability of our communities;\nvariety of product types offered in the area;\npricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;\nalternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third parties;\namount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market or sub-market; and\nlocal economic and demographic trends.\nFor those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot. Impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities and completed rental properties when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes.\nWe rarely purchase land for resale. However, when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans, and we determine that we will sell the asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met. We record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. In performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, recent offers received to purchase the property, prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land. If the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nThe key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions, and are inherently uncertain. Although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates.\nLegal Claims and Insurance\n— We are named as a defendant in various claims, complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. At any point in time, we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other matters. We have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. Approximately 98% and 97% of these reserves related to construction defect matters at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOur reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. At September 30, 2025 and 2024, we had reserves for approximately 875 and 825 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During fiscal 2025, we were notified of approximately 455 new construction defect claims and resolved 405 construction defect claims for a total cost of $57.2 million. We have closed a significant number of homes during recent years, and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes. Although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate. Historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims. These estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs.\nHistorical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and we believe they may continue to fluctuate. We also believe that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. If the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations, it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future. If the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity.\nWe estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. However, because the self-insured retentions under these policies are significant, we anticipate we will largely be self-insured. Addition",
