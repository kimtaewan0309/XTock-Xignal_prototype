We serve customers in ov\ner 200 countries and territories around t\nOtis has global scale and local focus, with more than 1,400 branc\nhes and offices, and a direct physical presence in more than 70\nThe following description of our busin\nthe information contained therein under the heading \"Business Overview.\"\nDescription of Business by Segment\nOur Company is organized into two segments, New Equipment and Service, which, for 2024, contributed 38% and 62% of our net sales, and 13% and 87% of our segment operating profit, respectively. Our international operations represented\nximately 70% of our net sales for 2024.\nThrough our New Equipment segment, we design, manufacture, sell and install a wide range of passenger and freight elevators, as well as escalators and moving\nwalkways for residential, commercial and infrastructure projects.\nOur New Equipment customers include real estate and building developers and general contractors who develop and/or design buildings for residential, commercial, retail or mixed-use activity. We also sell New Equipment to government agencies, particularly, to support infrastructure projects, such as airports, railways or metros. We generally sell directly to our customers through our New Equipment sales personnel. Due to the nature of the customer base in China and certain other geographies, our direct sales force is augmented by agents and distributors. Given the breadth of our customer base and the large number of customers to whom we deliver new equipment on an annual basis, we are not dependent on any single customer and do not have any contracts material to Otis as a whole with any single customer. The same is true for our broad and geographically dispersed network of agents and distributors.\nNew Equipment customers typically engage with us at an early stage during the construction cycle. The timing of order placement depends on factors including project complexity and customer requirements. Elevator installation usually occurs midway through building construction.\nNew Equipment orders are generally delivered w\nithin 12 months of booking, although larger projects can take longer to deliver based on customer construction schedules, and in some regions, mostly in China, the order to delivery window is shorter.\nWhen placing New Equipment orders, customers typically make an advance payment to cover costs including design and contract engineering. These advance payments are typically followed by periodic progress payments at specified milestones, such as delivery of materials at the job site and completion of installation and equipment commissioning. Installation is carried out by our installation technicians or through subcontractors, in which case we typically complete the final inspection and commissioning to ensure that our quality standards are met. Revenues are recognized based on percentage of completion. Once commissioned, New Equipment units are typically supported by a warranty for a limited period of time.\nWe have developed a range of elevator and escalator solutions to meet the varying needs and objectives of our diverse customers, primarily centered around the following elevator platforms:\n. Our primary elevator and escalator solutions are described below.\nHistorically, Gen2 is our principal low-and mid-rise elevator solution. Since its launch in 2000, we have sold over one million units, making it our best-selling elevator platform.\nThe successor to the Gen2 family of elevators, the Gen3 platform enhances the space-saving, energy-efficient design of the Gen2 elevator with the connectivity of the Otis ONE IoT (internet of things) digital service platform, while offering additional safety features for passengers and our colleagues who maintain the elevator.\nIn 2023, we introduced the new Gen3 Core elevator in North America, which was designed specifically for low-rise buildings, bringing passengers connectivity, style, and comfort. The Gen3 Core helps minimize energy consumption, material usage and installation costs.\nInitially launched in Europe, we expanded the Gen360 platform into China in 2023. The Gen360 elevator frees hoistway space to accommodate larger cabins and features a new electronic architecture, with many mechanical components replaced by electronic components that, when combined with our service, increase reliability and reduce the potential for entrapments. A foldable, in-ceiling platform allows maintenance operations to be performed safely from within the car rather than on top of it and, depending on local regulations, eliminates the need for a refuge space above the car and the protrusion on the roof allowing for a flat roof design. With optional 360-degree cameras in the hoistway, Otis service teams can visually confirm, fine-tune, diagnose and solve many issues remotely without stopping the elevator. The Otis ONE IoT solution adds a network of sensors for real-time status updates.\nFor taller, high-rise buildings, the SkyRise advanced elevator platform combines cutting-edge technologies and precision engineering to deliver solutions for residential, commercial and mixed-use skyscrapers.\nEscalators and Moving Walkways\no elevator solutions, we also offer escalators and moving walkways. With a range of finishes and aesthetics, Otis escalators integrate easily with any building design. Our smart design and features enhance sustainability and passenger safety, such as sensor-equipped escalators and moving walkways that efficiently run only when passengers approach, or operate at reduced speeds to conserve energy when there are no riders.\nThrough our Service segment, we perform maintenance and repair services, as well as modernization services to upgrade elevators and\nescalators. We have a maintenance portfolio of\napproximately 2.4 million units globally,\nwhich includes Otis equipment manufactured and sold by us, as well as equipment from other original equipment manufacturers. Through our network of service sales personnel, we sell our services directly to customers in all significant elevator and escalator verticals around the world.\nService customers typically comprise building owners, facility managers, housing associations and government agencies that operate buildings where elevators and escalators are installed. Customers securing services for elevators are frequently different from those who initially make purchasing decisions with respect to New Equipment solutions. As the largest service provider in the industry worldwide, we have a wide range of customers in our Service segment and do not have any single service contract that is material to Otis as a whole. Contract duration depends on several factors, including customer needs, regulatory requirements and industry/geography dynamics. We work closely with our customers to renew these contracts as appropriate. Certain types of customers, such as those owning or operating large properties or portfolios of properties, tend to execute long-term maintenance agreements.\nWe provide our Service offerings to our customers through a global network of\nService mechanics operating ou\nt of more than 1,400 bra\nnches and offices typically located in close proximity to concentrations of customers. Our mechanics are critical to\nour ability to deliver a high level of service to our customers. Our OTISLINE operations provide personalized customer support 24/7. They receive customer service requests and assign and dispatch field technicians, as necessary, to respond to service requests. We support our customers with our network of service parts centers and repair centers.\nOur services include inspections, preventive maintenance offerings and other customized maintenance offerings tailored to meet customer needs. A basic maintenance contract provides for inspection consistent with local regulatory needs. We offer incremental, tiered maintenance and service offerings, with varying levels of coverage up to and including comprehensive component replacement coverage. We also provide customers with repair services to address equipment and component wear and tear, as well as breakdowns.\nWe seek to grow our maintenance portfolio through conversion of newly installed units into maintenance contracts, through prospecting and winning units already in service from customers using another service provider and through acquisitions. Our Service sales personnel seek to win service contracts upon the expiration or termination of existing service contracts from customers by offering a superior value proposition through service excellence, an engaged and technically sophisticated group of field service technicians, a streamlined customer experience and reliable elevator and escalator operating performance.\nSimilar to most other electro-mechanical equipment, elevators and escalators are subject to wear and tear, which over time erodes equipment functionality. As elevator equipment ages, we work with customers to help renew or refresh their elevators with modernization solutions that enhance equipment operation, improve building functionality and contribute to more sustainable building systems. Modernization offerings can range from relatively simple upgrades of interior finishes and aesthetics to complex upgrades of larger components and sub-systems. Our GEN3 MOD Plus modernization offering for residential, commercial, hospitality, medical or industrial buildings includes built-in connectivity to our Otis ONE IoT digital platform.\nDigital Technology initiatives\nOtis offers a range of technologies for improving the passenger experience and we have been using technology to monitor elevator performance remotely for decades. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 1.0 million units of our global portfolio, including units under the warranty period, are connected. In 2025, we expect to continue to innovate and expand our digital ecosystem and suite of digital solutions for both our existing service portfolio customers and for new equipment shipments from our factories.\nOtis ONE is our latest cloud-based IoT technology, designed to continuously monitor equipment health and performance in real time to provide proactive, predictive and transparent information to our technicians and customers. The technology expands predictive and remote maintenance capabilities to support improved elevator up-time and service productivity.\nWe offer additional technology and multimedia options to customers with voice, data and video digital services, leveraging our IoT technologies, as described below. These are often incorporated as an optional upgrade on maintenance contracts.\neView In-Car Display\nOur in-car display streams live, customizable infotainment to passengers and can connect them to OTISLINE, Otis' 24-hour service call center, during an emergency.\nCompass 360 Destination Management System\nOur proprietary destination management system groups passengers by their desired destination and directs them to an assigned car that minimizes waiting and ride time. The system's algorithms anticipate traffic demand within a building and improve traffic flow.\neCall Plus Smartphone App\nOtis' smartphone app enables passengers to summon their elevator remotely for a touchless experience.\nResearch and Development & Intellectual Property\nInnovation is a fundamental characteristic of our history and is central to our strategy. For\n, research and development (\"R&D\") expense wa\ns $152 million and 1.1% as a percentage\nof net sales. In addition to R&D expense, we made investments in digital and strategic initiatives of\n, which in combination with R&D expense was 1.4% as a percentage of net sales.\nWe coordinate our R&D efforts globally through an operating model that sets global and local priorities based on customer and segment needs. We have 11 R&D centers and 17 factories around the world, including major locations in China, India, Japan, France, ",
  "item7_clean": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWe are the world’s leading elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. Our Company is organized into two segments, New Equipment and Service. Through our New Equipment segment, we design, manufacture, sell and install a wide range of passenger and freight elevators, as well as escalators and moving walkways for residential and commercial buildings and infrastructure projects. Our New Equipment customers include real-estate and building developers and general contractors who develop and/or design buildings for residential, commercial, retail or mixed-use activity. We sell our New Equipment directly to customers, as well as through agents and distributors.\nThrough our Service segment, we perform maintenance and repair services for both our own products and those of other manufacturers and provide modernization services to upgrade elevators and escalators. Maintenance services include inspections to ensure code compliance, preventive maintenance offerings and other customized maintenance offerings tailored to meet customer needs, as well as repair services to address equipment and component wear and tear and breakdowns. Modernization services enhance equipment operation and improve building functionality. Modernization offerings can range from relatively simple upgrades of interior finishes and aesthetics to complex upgrades of larger components and sub-systems. Our typical Service customers include building owners, facility managers, housing associations and government agencies that operate buildings where elevators and escalators are installed.\nWe serve our customers through a global network of employees. These include sales personnel, field technicians with separate skills in performing installation and service, as well as engineers driving our continued product development and innovation. We function under a centralized operating model whereby we pursue a global strategy set around New Equipment and Service because we seek to grow our maintenance portfolio, in part, through the conversion of new elevator and escalator installations into service contracts. Accordingly, we benefit from an integrated global strategy, which sets priorities and establishes accountability across the full product lifecycle.\nAnnounced in July 2023, UpLift is a program with the goal of transforming our operating model. UpLift includes the standardization of our processes and improvement of our supply chain procurement, among other aspects of the program, as well as organizational changes which result in restructuring actions. We expect UpLift to generate approximately $200 million in annual run-rate savings by the second half of 2025, with restructuring and other incremental costs to complete the transformation (\"UpLift transformation costs\") of approximately $300 million.\nThe Company generated approximately $70 million of pre-tax savings in 2024, including run-rate savings of approximately $120 million, driven by our simplified operating structure, optimized organizational spans and layers, and reduced digital technology costs. These savings are primarily reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nUpLift costs incurred are as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\nUpLift restructuring costs\nUpLift transformation costs\nTotal UpLift costs incurred to date are $137 million, including $56 million of restructuring costs and $81 million of transformation costs.\nUpLift restructuring costs are primarily severance costs and are recorded primarily in Selling, general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. UpLift transformation costs are primarily for consultants, third-party service providers and personnel focused on designing and implementing a centralized service delivery model that supports our new organizational structure, including the standardization of our supply chain and digital technology procurement. These costs are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor further details, refer to the discussion on restructuring costs in the \"Results of Operations,\" as well as \"\nGerman Tax Litigation\nIn August 2024, we received a favorable ruling regarding a German tax litigation. As a result, we recorded income tax benefits of approximately $185 million and related interest income of approximately $200 million, which are included in Income tax expense (benefit), net and Interest expense (income), net, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2024. Additionally, pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement (\"TMA\") with RTX Corporation (\"RTX\", our former parent), the Company recorded indemnification expense of $194 million for amounts due to RTX resulting from the outcome of the German tax litigation. This expense is included in Other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2024.\nImpact of Global Macroeconomic Conditions on Our Company\nGlobal macroeconomic conditions have impacted, and continue to impact, aspects of the Company's operations and overall financial performance. These macroeconomic conditions include, among others, inflationary pressures, high interest rates and tighter credit conditions. These macroeconomic trends could continue to impact our business, including impacts to overall financial performance in 2025, as a result of the following, among other things:\nCustomer demand impacting our new equipment, maintenance and repair, and modernization businesses;\nCustomer liquidity constraints and related credit reserve;\nCancellations or delays of customer orders; and\nSupplier liquidity, as well as supplier and raw material capacity constraints, delays and related costs.\nWe currently do not expect any significant impact to our capital and financial resources from these macroeconomic conditions, including to our overall liquidity position based on our available cash and cash equivalents and our access to credit facilities and the capital markets.\nRisks Associated with Ongoing Conflicts\nThe ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, including volatile commodity markets, foreign exchange fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cybersecurity incidents, reputational risk, increased operating costs (including fuel and other input costs), environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions and other regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). As discussed below, we do not have operations in Russia.\nAdditionally, we do not have operations or material net sales in Israel or Gaza. Although we have operations in the Middle East and transport products through the Red Sea, we currently do not expect the recent conflicts in that region to have a material impact on our business.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\")\nThere have been no, and we do not expect there to be in the near term, material impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations as a result of compliance with legislation or regulatory rules regarding climate change, from the known physical eff\nects of climate change or as a result of implementing our ESG initiatives. Increased regulation and other climate change concerns, however, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, and we are not able to predict how su\nch regulations or concerns would affect our business, operations or financial results.\nZardoya Otis Tender Offer\nAs previously disclosed, the Company announced the Tender Offer to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of Zardoya Otis not owned by Otis, at an offer price of €7.07 per share in cash, after adjusting for dividends. The results of the Tender Offer were announced on April 7, 2022, with tenders of 45.49% of the shares outstanding accepted. The shares tendered to the Company were settled in cash on April 12, 2022 for approximately €1.5 billion from the Company's restricted cash held in escrow, resulting in the Company owning 95.51% of Zardoya Otis. The acquisition and settlement of the remaining issued and outstanding shares not owned by the Company for approximately €150 million (based on the adjusted tender price of €7.07 per share) and the automatic delisting of Zardoya Otis shares both occurred during the second quarter of 2022. Zardoya Otis was renamed Otis Mobility upon completion of the Tender Offer and delisting.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(dollars in millions)\n\n(referred to, collectively, as \"ASC 606\").\nFor new equipment and modernization contracts, equipment and installation are typically procured in a single contract providing the customer with a complete installed elevator or escalator unit. The combination of equipment and installation promises are typically a single performance obligation. For these performance obligations, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Contract costs are usually incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management’s judgment. Contract costs included in the calculation are comprised of labor, materials, subcontractors’ costs or other direct costs and indirect costs, which include indirect labor costs.\nThe long-term nature of the contracts, the complexity of the products and the scale of the projects can affect our ability to estimate costs precisely. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical costs experience and expected costs considering current circumstances. We review cost estimates for modification on significant new equipment and modernization contracts on a quarterly basis and when circumstances change, and for others, no less frequently than annually or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. We record changes in contract estimates using the cumulative catch-up method and we review changes in contract estimates for their impact on net sales or operating profit in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Modifications are recognized as a cumulative catch-up or treated as a separate accounting contract if the modification adds distinct goods or services and the modification is priced at its stand-alone selling price.\nThe future tax benefit arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards was $576 million and $618 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Management estimates that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be generally sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income, considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made.\nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon\nWe have generated goodwill as a result of our acquisitions. At the time of acquisition, we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nWe review our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at July 1 or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at a level within the Company referred to as the reporting unit, which is one level below the operating segment level. We have determined there are three reporting units within each business segment.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350,\nIntangibles – Goodwill and Other\n, we initially perform a qualitative assessment (commonly known as \"step zero\") to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing the two-step test. The qualitative assessment requires judgments by management about economic conditions including the entity’s operating environment, its industry and other market considerations, entity-specific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel and other events that could impact the reporting unit. If management concludes, based on assessment of relevant events, facts and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying value, no further impairment testing is required. If we determine, based on this assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. No impairment loss is recognized if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value.\nWe completed the annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units\nas of July 1, 2024 and d\netermined that no adjustment to goodwill was necessary as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value of each reporting unit.\nContingent Liabilities\nOtis is party to litigation related to a n\nparticular, they may include risks associated with contractual, regulatory and other matters, which may arise in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of these matters may have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Management regularly analyzes current information about these matters and accrues for contingent losses that are probable and reasonably estimable. To assess the exposure to potential liability, we consult with relevant internal and external counsel. In making the decision regarding the need for loss accruals, management considers the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of loss.
