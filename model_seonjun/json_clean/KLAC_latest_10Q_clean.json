Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, support R&D and manufacturing of integrated circuits (“IC”), wafers and reticles. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical and nanometric level product defects, helping them to manage manufacturing process challenges and to obtain higher finish product yields at lower cost. We also offer advanced technology solutions to address various manufacturing needs of printed circuit boards (“PCB”), specialty semiconductor devices and other electronic components, including advanced packaging, light-emitting diode (“LED”), power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research. In addition, our services business has grown consistently year-over-year and accounted for approximately 23% of our total revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Our services revenue, which is generated largely from recurring “subscription-like” contracts, increases the value of our contract offerings and extension of system lifetimes resulting from growth in legacy semiconductor markets.\nWe are organized into three reportable segments as follows:\nSemiconductor Process Control: a comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products as well as related service offerings that help IC manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the semiconductor fabrication process, from R&D to final volume production.\nSpecialty Semiconductor Process: advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers.\nPCB and Component Inspection: a range of inspection, testing and measurement, and direct imaging for patterning products used by manufacturers of PCBs, advanced packaging, microelectromechanical systems (“MEMS”) and other electronic components.\nThe semiconductor industry continues to experience significant market expansion and diversification. High-performance computing and data centers, fueled by widespread adoption of AI, are driving industry growth. We believe AI is a technology inflection point driving innovation and demand at the leading edge, and our portfolio of products is uniquely positioned to support leading-edge demand and the ongoing AI buildout. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or both of the major semiconductor devi"
