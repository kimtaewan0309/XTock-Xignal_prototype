  "item1_clean": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIngersoll Rand Inc. is a diversified, global provider of mission-critical flow creation products, and industrial and life science solutions. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ingersoll Rand Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as “Ingersoll Rand,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “ourselves”).\nWe are a global market leader with a broad flow creation and industrial product portfolio across air, gas, powder, and liquid handling applications, providing services and solutions to increase industrial and life science productivity, efficiency, and sustainability. We manufacture one of the broadest and most complete ranges of compressor, pump, vacuum and blower products in our markets, which, when combined with our global geographic footprint and application expertise, allows us to provide differentiated product and service offerings to our customers. Our products are sold under more than 80 market-leading brands, including Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver, which we believe are globally recognized in their respective end-markets and known for product quality, reliability, efficiency and superior customer service. We are driven by an entrepreneurial spirit and ownership mindset, dedicated to helping make life better for our employees, customers, the planet, and our shareholders.\nThese attributes, along with over 160 years of engineering heritage, generate strong brand loyalty for our products and foster long-standing customer relationships, resulting in leading market positions within each of our operating segments. We have sales in all major geographic markets and our diverse customer base utilizes our products across a wide array of end-markets, including life sciences, food and beverage production, clean energy, industrial manufacturing, infrastructure, water and wastewater treatment, and many others.\nOur products and services are critical to the processes and systems in which they are utilized, which are often complex and the cost of failure or downtime is high. However, our products typically represent only a small portion of the costs of the overall systems or functions that they support. As a result, our customers place a high value on our application expertise, product reliability and the responsiveness of our service. To support our customers and market presence, we maintain significant global scale with over 60 key manufacturing facilities, and over 40 complementary service and repair centers across six continents and over 21,000 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2024.\nThe process-critical nature of our product applications, coupled with the standard wear and tear replacement cycles associated with the usage of our products, generates opportunities to support customers with our broad portfolio of services, spare parts, and consumables. Customers place a high value on maximizing the time their operations are online, reducing their operating expenses, and improving the sustainability of their processes. As a result, the availability of replacement parts, consumables and our repair and support services are key components of our value proposition. Our large installed base of products provides a\nrecurring revenue stream through our aftermarket parts, consumables and services offerings. As a result, our aftermarket revenue is significant, representing 36.4% of total Company revenue in 2024.\nIndustrial Technologies and Services\nWe design, manufacture, market and service a broad range of air and gas compression, vacuum and blower products, fluid transfer equipment, loading systems, power tools and lifting equipment, including associated aftermarket parts, consumables and services. We primarily sell under the Ingersoll Rand, Gardner Denver, Nash, CompAir, Elmo Rietschle, and over 30 other brands. Our customers deploy our products across a wide array of applications in diverse end-markets. Compressors are used to increase the pressure of air or gas, vacuum products are used to remove air or gas in order to reduce the pressure below atmospheric levels, and blower products are used to produce a high volume of air or gas at low pressure. Almost every manufacturing and industrial facility, and many service and process industry applications, use air compression, vacuum and blower products in a variety of process-critical applications such as the operation of pneumatic tools, pumps and motion control components, air and gas separation, vacuum packaging of food products and aeration of waste water, among others. Our vacuum pumps and compressors are used in many power generation, mining, oil and gas refining and processing, chemical processing and general industrial applications including flare gas and vapor recovery, geothermal gas removal, vacuum deaeration, water extraction in mining and paper and chlorine compression in petrochemical operations. Our engineered loading systems and fluid transfer equipment ensure the safe handling and transfer of crude oil, liquefied natural gas, compressed natural gas, chemicals, and bulk materials. Our power tools and lifting equipment portfolio includes electric and cordless fastening systems, pneumatic bolting tools, drilling and material removal tools, hoists, winches and ergonomic handling devices. Typical applications for these products include the precision fastening of bolted joints in the production, assembly and servicing of industrial machinery, on-highway and off-highway vehicles, aircraft, electronics and other equipment.\nOur compression products cover the full range of technologies, including rotary screw, reciprocating piston, scroll, rotary vane and centrifugal compressors. Our vacuum products and blowers also cover the full technology spectrum; vacuum technologies include side channel, liquid ring, claw vacuum, screw, turbo and rotary vane vacuum pumps among others, while blower technologies include rotary lobe, screw, claw and vane, side channel and radial blowers.\nWe complement these products with a broad portfolio of service options tailored to customer needs and a complete range of aftermarket parts, air treatment equipment, controls and other accessories delivered through our global network of manufacturing and service locations and distributor partners. The breadth and depth of our product offering creates incremental business opportunities by allowing us to cross-sell our full product portfolio and uniquely address customers’ needs in one complete solution.\nWe sell our products through an integrated network of direct sales representatives and independent distributors, which is strategically tailored to meet the dynamics of each target geography or end-market. Our large installed base also provides for a significant stream of recurring aftermarket revenue. For example, the useful life of a compressor is, on average, between 10 and 12 years. However, a customer typically services the compressor at regular intervals, starting within the first two years of purchase and continuing throughout the life of the product. The cumulative aftermarket revenue generated by a compressor over the product’s life cycle will typically exceed its original sale price.\nPrecision and Science Technologies\nWe design, manufacture and market a broad range of highly-specialized equipment for both industrial and life sciences markets. Our products are used for precision dosing, liquid and solid transfer, dispensing, gas compression, gas sampling, pressure management, flow control, and powder handling, amongst other applications. Major categories of our portfolio are (a) pumps and liquid handling systems and (b) life science tools and systems. Within pumps and liquid handling systems, our offering covers a broad range of pump and flow control technology types. This includes diaphragm pumps, piston pumps, water-powered pumps, peristaltic pumps, gear pumps, vane pumps, progressive cavity pumps, syringe pumps, gas boosters, hydrogen compression systems, automated liquid handling systems, odorant injection systems, controls, software and other related components and accessories. These offerings are sold under brands that are highly recognized in their end markets including Air Dimensions, Albin, ARO, Dosatron, Haskel, Ingersoll Rand, LMI, Maximus, Milton Roy, MP, Oberdorfer, Seepex, Thomas, Welch, Williams, YZ and Zinsser Analytic. Within life science tools and systems, our primary offerings include single-use powder handling systems and isolators for disposable process and powder containment, and contract design and productions for services for silicone, thermoplastic, and specialty components and assemblies for medical devices. These offerings are sold primarily under the ILC Dover and Flexan brands. We also manufacture space suits, inflatable habitats, and lighter-than-air vehicles for human mobility and habitation and defense applications. Our customer base is composed of a wide range of end users in markets including life sciences, industrial manufacturing, water and waste water, chemical processing,\nenergy, food and beverage, agriculture and others. Our sales are realized primarily through a combination of independent specialty and national distributors and relationships directly with original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), Engineering, Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) companies and end users.\nThe Company continued its focus on generating inorganic growth through acquisitions that strengthen our position in core product categories and broaden our exposure to high-growth, sustainable end markets. We completed or announced the acquisition of several businesses during 2024, including the following:\nIn February 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Friulair S.r.l. (“Friulair”) for initial cash consideration of $143.3 million and contingent consideration of up to approximately $11.0 million.

  "item7_clean": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIngersoll Rand is a global market leader with a broad range of innovative and mission-critical air, fluid, clean energy and medical technologies, providing services and solutions to increase industrial productivity and efficiency. We manufacture one of the broadest and most complete ranges of compressor, pump, vacuum and blower products in our markets, which, when combined with our global geographic footprint and application expertise, allows us to provide differentiated product and service offerings to our customers. Our products are sold under a collection of premier, market-leading brands, including Ingersoll Rand, Gardner Denver, Nash, CompAir, Thomas, Milton Roy, Seepex, Elmo Rietschle, ARO, Robuschi, ILC Dover, Emco Wheaton\nand Runtech Systems, which we believe are globally recognized in their respective end-markets and known for product quality, reliability, efficiency and superior customer service.\nThese attributes, along with over 160 years of engineering heritage, generate strong brand loyalty for our products and foster long-standing customer relationships, which we believe have resulted in leading market positions within each of our operating segments. We have sales in all major geographic markets and our diverse customer base utilizes our products across a wide array of end-markets that have favorable near- and long-term growth prospects, including industrial manufacturing, clean energy, transportation, medical and laboratory sciences, food and beverage packaging and chemical processing.\nOur products and services are critical to the processes and systems in which they are utilized, which are often complex and function in harsh conditions where the cost of failure or downtime is high. However, our products and services typically represent only a small portion of the costs of the overall systems or functions that they support. As a result, our customers place a high value on our application expertise, product reliability and the responsiveness of our service. To support our customers and market presence, we maintain significant global scale with over 60 key manufacturing facilities, and over 40 complementary service and repair centers across six continents and over 21,000 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2024.\nThe process-critical nature of our product applications, coupled with the standard wear and tear replacement cycles associated with the usage of our products, generates opportunities to support customers with our broad portfolio of aftermarket parts, consumables and services. Customers place a high value on minimizing any time their operations are offline. As a result, the availability of replacement parts, consumables and our repair and support services are key components of our value proposition. Our large installed base of products provides a recurring revenue stream through our aftermarket parts, consumables and services offerings. As a result, our aftermarket revenue is significant, representing 36.4% of total Company revenue in 2024.\nComponents of Our Revenue and Expenses\nWe generate revenue from sales of original equipment and associated aftermarket parts, consumables and services. We sell our products and deliver services both directly to end-users and through independent distribution channels, depending on the product line and geography. Revenue derived from short duration contracts is recognized at a single point in time when control is transferred to the customer, generally at shipment or when delivery has occurred or as services are performed. Certain contracts involve significant design engineering unique to customer specifications, and depending upon the contractual terms, revenue is recognized either over the duration of the contract or at contract completion when equipment is delivered to the customer.\nCost of sales includes the costs we incur, including purchased materials, labor and overhead related to manufactured products and aftermarket parts sold during a period. Depreciation related to manufacturing equipment and facilities is included in cost of sales. Purchased materials represent the majority of costs of sales, with steel, aluminum, copper and partially finished castings representing our most significant material inputs. Stock-based compensation expense for employees associated with the manufacture of products or delivery of services to customers is included in cost of sales. We have instituted a global sourcing strategy to take advantage of coordinated purchasing opportunities of key materials across our manufacturing plant locations.\nCost of sales for services includes the direct costs we incur, including direct labor, parts and other overhead costs including depreciation of equipment and facilities, to deliver repair, maintenance and other field services to our customers.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses consist of (i) salaries and other employee-related expenses for our selling and administrative functions and other activities not associated with the manufacture of products or delivery of services to customers; (ii) facility operating expenses for selling and administrative activities, including office rent, maintenance, depreciation and insurance; (iii) marketing and direct costs of selling products and services to customers including internal and external sales commissions; (iv) research and development expenditures; (v) professional and consultant fees; (vi) employee related stock-based compensation for our selling and administrative functions and (vii) other miscellaneous expenses. Certain corporate expenses, including those related to our shared service centers in the United States and Europe, that directly benefit our businesses are allocated to our business segments. Certain corporate administrative expenses, including corporate executive compensation, treasury, certain information technology, internal audit and tax compliance, are not allocated to the business segments.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets includes the periodic amortization of intangible assets, including customer relationships, tradenames, developed technology, backlog and internal-use software.\nOther Operating Expense, Net\nOther operating expense, net includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, net, restructuring charges, acquisition and other transaction related expenses and non-cash charges, losses and gains on asset disposals and other miscellaneous operating expenses.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThe provision or benefit for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and all non-U.S. income taxes. We are subject to income tax in 48 jurisdictions outside of the United States. Because we conduct operations on a global basis, our effective tax rate depends, and will continue to depend, on the geographic distribution of our pre-tax earnings among several different taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate can also vary based on changes in the tax rates of the different jurisdictions, the availability of tax credits and non-deductible items.\nItems Affecting our Reported Results\nGeneral Economic Conditions and Capital Spending in the Industries We Serve\nOur financial results closely follow changes in the industries and end-markets we serve. Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures depends, in turn, on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost. In particular, demand for our Industrial Technologies and Services products generally correlates with the rate of total industrial capacity utilization and the rate of change of industrial production. Capacity utilization rates above 80% have historically indicated a strong demand environment for industrial equipment. In our Industrial Technologies and Services segment, overall economic growth and industrial production, as well as secular trends, impact demand for our products. In certain businesses of our Precision and Science Technologies segment, we expect demand for our products to be driven by favorable trends, including the growth in healthcare spend and expansion of healthcare systems due to an aging population requiring medical care and increased investment in health solutions and safety infrastructures in emerging economies. Over longer time periods, we believe that demand for all of our products also tends to follow economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the GDP around the world, as augmented by secular trends in each segment. Our ability to grow and our financial performance will also be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations, including efficiently utilizing our global sales, manufacturing and distribution capabilities and engineering innovative new product applications for end-users in a variety of geographic markets.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nA significant portion of our revenues, 55% for the year ended December 31, 2024, was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because much of our manufacturing facilities and labor force costs are outside of the United States, a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign exchange rates can therefore impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations\nCertain factors affecting the comparability of our current and historical results of operations are summarized below.\nPart of our strategy for growth is to acquire complementary businesses that provide access to new technologies or geographies or expand our offerings. While acquisitions, as discussed further in Note 4, are not individually significant or significant in the aggregate, they may be relevant when comparing our results from period to period.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nWe manage operations through the two business segments described above. In addition to our consolidated GAAP financial measures, we review various non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are helpful supplemental measures to assist us and investors in evaluating our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period to period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operations of our business. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash, non-recurring and other adjustment items. We believe that the adjustments applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about non-recurring items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) including interest, depreciation and amortization of non-acquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions.\nWe use Free Cash Flow to review the liquidity of our operations. We measure Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service our debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities.\nManagement and our board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating our operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation. Such measures are provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable measures under GAAP. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers, many of which also present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.\nIncluded in our discussion of our consolidated and segment results below are changes in revenues and Adjusted EBITDA on a Constant Currency basis. Constant Currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define Constant Currency revenues and Adjusted EBITDA as total revenues and Adjusted EBITDA excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and use it to determine the Constant Currency revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth on a year-over-year basis. Constant Currency revenues and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated by translating current period revenues and Adjusted EBITDA using corresponding prior period exchange rates. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a Constant Currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nFor further information regarding these measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nResults of Continuing Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\nYear Ended December 31,\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nSelling and administrative expenses\nAmortization of intangible assets\nImpairment of other intangible assets\nOther operating expense, net\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nIncome Before Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nLoss on equity method investments\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\nNet Income Attributable to Ingersoll Rand Inc.\nPercentage of Revenues\nSelling and administrative expenses\nOther Financial Data\nCash flows - operating activities\nCash flows - investing activities\nCash flows - financing activities\nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nRevenues for 2024 were $7,235.0 million, an increase of $358.9 million, or 5.2%, compared to $6,876.1 million in 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to acquisitions of $471.2 million and higher pricing of $153.3 million, partially offset by lower organic volumes of $241.9 million and unfavorable impact of foreign currencies of $23.7 million. The percentage of consolidated revenues derived from aftermarket parts and services was 36.4% in 2024 compared to 35.8% in 2023.\nGross profit in 2024 was $3,170.0 million, an increase of $287.8 million, or 10.0%, compared to $2,882.2 million in 2023, and as a percentage of revenues was 43.8% in 2024 and 41.9% in 2023. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to higher pricing and acquisitions discussed above. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to increased price and input co",
