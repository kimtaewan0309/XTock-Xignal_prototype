  "item1_clean": "We believe it is also appropriate\nto think about our private label sales as a percentage of our non-fastener sales for two reasons: (1) there is not a well-defined branded versus private label dynamic in fasteners as there is in non-fasteners; and (2) non-fastener data is more comparable to information reported by our peers, who do not generally have our significant mix of fastener business. Private label brand sales represented approximately 17% of our total non-fastener sales in 2024. Over time we expect our private label sales as a percentage of our total non-fastener sales to increase, although oftentimes, these increases through specific channels are masked by the relative sales growth we experience with Onsite locations, which typically have a lower percentage of total sales of private label than in branches or sales through vending devices.\nOur inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems, by our sales personnel at in-market locations, and by our district and regional leadership. The data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations, from individual selling locations, and from different geographic areas. It is also derived from supplier information and from customer demographic information. Our computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment, or prompts a buyer to purchase, as necessary, based on an established minimum-maximum stocking level. In the past we have utilized a base inventory model for all of our branches, and such a model still exists in a smaller subset of our locations. Increasingly, however, branches primarily stock inventory that is deemed to be appropriate by the district and branch personnel to service the customers within their selling territory. Similarly, non-branch selling locations (primarily Onsites) stock inventory exclusively based on customer-specific arrangements. Inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center. Inventory quantities are continuously re-balanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call 'inventory re-distribution'.\nInventory held at our selling locations, close to customers and available on a same-day basis, accounted for approximately 59% of our total inventory at the end of 2024. Inventory held at our distribution centers and manufacturing locations accounted for approximately 41% of our total inventory at the end of 2024. The distribution center and manufacturing location inventory, when combined with our trucking network, allows for fast, next-day service at a very competitive cost.\nManufacturing and Support Services Operations\napproximately 96% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements. The remaining 4% related to products manufactured, modified, or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our industrial services. These manufactured products c\nonsist primarily of non-standard sizes of threaded fasteners and hardware made to customers' specifications\nat one of our nine manufacturing locations, or standard sizes manufactured under our Holo-Krome\nproduct lines. These manufacturing products represent approximately 7% of our fastener sales. The services provided by the industrial services group include, but are not limited to, tool and hoist repair, chain sling and hose fabrication, band saw blade welding, packaging, and other light manufacturing and fabrication. We may add additional services in the future. We engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect the services to continue to contribute in the range of 4% to 6% of our consolidated net sales in the future.\nWe use a diverse group of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute. Most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources, although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control, strong relationships, reliable lead times, and effective costing. During 2024, we had a single supplier that accounted for more than 5% of our inventory purchases, whereas all remaining suppliers fell below that threshold.\nIn the case of fasteners and our private label non-fastener products, we have a large number of suppliers but these suppliers are heavily concentrated in a single geographic area, Asia. Within Asia, suppliers in China and Taiwan represent a significant source of product. Further, in many cases where we source directly from a North American supplier, the original country of origin of the acquired parts is the supplier's Asian facilities. As a result, the cost and effectiveness of our supply chain is dependent on relatively unfettered trade across geographic regions.\nBeyond inventory, we have some concentration of purchasing activity. For example, we utilize a limited number of suppliers for our distribution equipment and our vehicle fleet, and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment. However, we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these, if necessary.\nCustomers and Marketing\nOur model is built around a broad product offering, timely fulfillment processes, convenient physical locations, extensive digital and services capabilities, and the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees. We believe we are successful because of our ability to integrate these features into supply chain solutions that are tailored to the specific challenges\nof our customer's operations. When deployed effectively, we have demonstrated the ability to assume responsibility for portions of our customer's sourcing operations while reducing the cost, lowering the risk, and increasing the scalability of our customer's supply chains. Our value proposition is focused on improving the operating effectiveness and reducing the total cost of ownership of our customer's supply chains.\nApproximately 70% to 75% of our customers are in manufacturing end markets, which encompasses heavy machinery, fabricated products, process industries (oil & gas, petrochemical, mining, pulp and paper, etc.), and transportation components (automotive, aerospace, etc.). We provide both the OEM and MRO needs of these customers. The remaining 25% to 30% of our customers fall primarily into non-residential construction (general and commercial contractors), reseller (retail and wholesale trades, dealers, and rental businesses), transportation services (air, train, maritime or truck transport, as well as warehousing and fulfillment centers), and state and local government entities, including schools, school districts, and universities.\nBased on our customer profile being oriented toward manufacturing, our business has historically been cyclical. However, we believe our model has certain features that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes. First, we have a large number of customers that serve a wide range of segments within the broader manufacturing market. While slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other interrelated industries, locally or globally, we still believe this customer and market segment diversity provides some insulation from economic changes that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions. Second, while a meaningful part of our sales is derived from products that are incorporated into final products, the greater proportion of our sales is derived from products used to maintain facilities. This latter source of sales tends to be impacted by cyclical forces, but its rate of change tends to be less dramatic.\nApproximately 72% of our consolidated sales in 2024 were with customers whose spend was subject to a contractual agreement between ourselves and the customer. The terms and conditions of these contracts will vary from customer to customer, with the most common features being the scope of products and services rendered, product and service pricing, payment terms, delivery expectations, quality obligations, warranty and liability exposure, and contract duration. Many contracts will also incorporate expectations for direct (e.g., cost) or indirect (e.g., process productivity and efficiency) savings that are expected to be achieved over the course of the contract and the interval at which progress toward these expectations will be reviewed.\nOur contractual programs fall into three broad categories:\nNational accounts represent the largest proportion of our contract business, accounting for 63% of our consolidated sales in 2024. This program is aimed at multi-location customers where the scale and scope of the OEM and MRO products that need to be managed are very complex and costly. We believe our broad product offering coupled with our local presence as part of a national and increasingly international footprint, our ability to provide a consistent level of high-touch service, and our ancillary capabilities around manufacturing, quality control, and product knowledge, are attractive to these multi-site customers. Further, we believe our advantage with these customers has only been strengthened as we have added other capabilities, such as Onsite, FMI, digital solutions, and resources to serve these customers' unique demands.\nLocal and regional contracts tend to establish terms and conditions for a customer's locations that have a more limited geographic scope, typically falling within an individual district or region. The scale and scope of the products and services that are addressed tend to be narrower and less complex than is the case for national account agreements. Some agreements cover the entirety of a customer's operations where the locations are focused in a specific geographic territory. Other agreements may represent a subset of a customer's North American or global operations, with additional locations either covered by separate local and regional contracts, being serviced on a transactional basis, or not being serviced at all. In the former case, we often try to migrate the customer to a national agreement.\nGovernment contracts establish Fastenal as an approved supplier of MRO products to facilities managed by local, state, or municipal authorities. We do not generate meaningful direct sales from federal government agencies. These agreements are not different in function from local and regional non-government contracts. However, they generally involve different priorities, are heavily influenced by stricter regulatory obligations, and require specialized knowledge and processes to negotiate and maintain compliance.\nWe anticipate sales to contract customers will increase as a percentage of our total sales over time.\nOur basic unit of measurement of customer b\nusiness activity in an in-market location is an active account, which is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $100 per month. Customers often have more than one active account at a single in-market location, reflecting their utilization of different Fastenal services, and frequently have active accounts at many in-market locations across our global network. In 2024, approximately 99.5% of the sales in our in-market locations were derived from our active accounts, with the remainder being from walk-in or infrequent, non-account, and small account customers. We have reported on the quantity of our active accounts annually, as set forth in the table above. The table also includes a subset of our active accounts, called 'key accounts'. This is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $2,000 per month. Key accounts have been a greater focus of our selling activities since 2020 because they typically utilize a wider range of our products and services, and in 2024, approximately 93.2% of the sales in our in-market locations were derived from our key accounts.\nDuring 2024, no sin",
  "item7_clean": "Q1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nOur gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 45.7% in 2023 and 46.1% in 2022. This decrease was primarily related to two factors. First, in 2023 customer and product mix had a negative effect on our gross profit percentage. We continued to experience relatively strong growth from larger customers, including Onsites, and non-fastener products, each of which tend to have a lower gross profit percentage than our business as a whole. Second, we had higher organizational/overhead costs, including from higher inbound freight costs and working capital needs being relieved from inventory and generating higher period costs. These negative effects were partly offset by favorable freight costs, which reflects elevated domestic freight sales leveraging what are relatively stable costs to support our captive fleet, lower expenses related to external freight providers, and lower fuel costs.\nOur SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, improved to 24.9% in 2023 from 25.2% in 2022. This primarily reflected improvement, as a percentage of net sales, in employee-related expenses as bonuses and commissions were down as a result of slower sales and profit growth in 2023 versus the prior year.\nThe percentage change in employee-related, occupancy-related, and all other SG&A expenses compared to the same periods in the preceding year, is outlined in the table below.\nApproximate Percentage\nof Total SG&A Expenses\nEmployee-related expenses\nOccupancy-related expenses\nAll other SG&A expenses\nOur employee-related expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to higher base pay and employment taxes as a result of increased FTE during the period and moderate wage inflation. This was partly offset by a decline in bonuses reflecting slower sales and profit growth versus the prior year.\nThe table below summarizes the percentage change in our FTE headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period:\nDistribution/Transportation personnel\nManufacturing personnel\nOrganizational support personnel\nOf our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location.\nOrganizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (approximately 35% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) IT personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (25% to 30% of category), which includes human resources, FSB, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nOur occupancy-related expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to: slightly higher depreciation and expenses related to a higher installed base of our FMI suite of technologies; moderately higher costs and depreciation for the maintenance, upgrade, and installation of equipment in hub and non-hub facilities; and a slight rise in branch rents related to higher inflation and branch size.\nCombined, all other SG&A expenses increased in 2023 from 2022. This was related to: higher spending on IT; higher general insurance costs; increased spending on travel and supplies; and higher bad debt expense. These elements were only partly offset by increased contributions from our\nsupplier collaboration programs and\nincreased income from asset sales related to our field truck fleet\nOur net interest expense was $6.7 in 2023 compared to $13.6 in 2022. We carried lower average debt balances in 2023 relative to the prior year, with cash generated from working capital reductions enabling us to reduce outstanding revolver debt under our Credit Facility. This was only partly offset by slightly higher average rates against borrowings under our Credit Facility due to changing interest rate levels in the marketplace. We also generated higher interest income in 2023 relative to the prior year.\nWe recorded income tax expense of $367.0 in 2023, or 24.1% of income before income taxes, compared to $353.1 in 2022, or 24.5% of income before income taxes. The decrease in our tax rate in 2023 is due primarily to an increase in the tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options.\nNet income, net income per share, the percentage change in net income, and the percentage change in net income per share, were as follows:\nBasic net income per share\nDiluted net income per share\nBasic net income per share\nDiluted net income per share\nDuring 2023, net income per share increased, primarily due to higher sales, lower net interest expense, a lower tax rate, and lower average fully diluted shares outstanding as a result of our buying back shares in 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net income were as follows:\nIn 2023, we experienced an increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net income. The improvement in operating cash flow in 2023, as a percent of net income, reflects the reduced demand for working capital as a result of an improved supply chain and, to a lesser degree, slower business activity relative to the prior year.\nTrade Working Capital Assets\nThe following table sets forth the dollar and percentage change in accounts receivable, net, inventories, and accounts payable for the period ended December 31:\n\nAccounts receivable, net\nTrade working capital\nTrade working capital, net\nNet sales in last three months\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nIn 2023, the annual growth in net accounts receivable is primarily attributable to three factors. First, our receivables increased as a result of growth in sales to our customers. Second, we continue to experience a shift in our mix due to relatively stronger growth from national account customers, which tend to carry longer payment terms than our non-national account customers. Third, and to a lesser degree, customers have historically delayed payments at the end of years that are economically challenged, and we saw that effect in 2023.\nIn 2023, our inventories decreased, reflecting the absence of supply chain disruptions from the prior year. Our response at the time was to deepen our inventory as a means of maintaining high service to our customers, particularly for imported inventory. Dissipation of these disruptions has allowed us to shorten our product ordering cycle. It is also likely that slower business activity reduced the level of inventory our customers required us to maintain to meet their production needs.\nIn 2023, the annual growth in accounts payable was primarily attributable to our product purchases increasing to support the growth in our business. The growth in our accounts payable balance is below the growth in our sales, which reflects the dissipation of supply chain disruptions from the prior year. This allowed us to shorten our product ordering cycle in 2023 versus 2022.\nThe approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end:\nDistribution center and manufacturing locations\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net income were as follows:\nOur net cash used in investing activities in 2023 was comparable to 2022 and primarily related to investments for net capital expenditures.\nSet forth below is a recap of our 2023 and 2022 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net income:\nManufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment, industrial vending equipment, and facilities\nShelving and related supplies for in-market location openings and for product expansion at existing in-market locations\nData processing software and equipment\nReal estate and improvements to branch locations\nPurchases of property and equipment\nProceeds from sale of property and equipment\nNet capital expenditures\nOur net capital expenditures in 2023 were comparable to 2022, though they were below our original expectations for net capital investment during the year. The slower business environment in 2023 reduced the need to purchase certain equipment at the pace originally anticipated. We also saw the timing of certain outlays pushed out and, to a lesser extent, longer lead times on certain materials. It does not reflect the cancellation of any significant initiatives.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of income were as follows:\nPurchases of common stock\nTotal returned to shareholders\nProceeds from the exercise of stock options\nDebt obligations payments (proceeds), net\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities reflects higher dividend payments, including a supplemental payment in December of 2023, and a reduction in our outstanding debt obligations. These uses of cash were only partly offset by the absence of common stock purchases that we made in the prior year and, to a lesser degree, the exercise of stock options.\nWe declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share on January 17, 2024. In 2023, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.78. This included $1.40 per share in regular quarterly dividends and a $0.38 per share special dividend paid in December 2023 reflecting what was at the time our high cash balances, as well as our favorable outlook for future cash generation. In 2022, we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $1.24.\nIn 2023, we did not purchase any of our common stock. In 2022, we purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately $47.58 per share.\nWe have authority to purchase up to 6,200,000 additional shares of our common stock under the July 12, 2022 authorization. This authorization does not have an expiration date.\nOur borrowings under the Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement peaked during each quarter of 2023 as follows:\nEffects of Inflation\nIn 2023, we observed easing in inflationary pressures for metals (especially steel), energy, and transportation services (especially overseas containers and shipping) resulting in stable costs for most of our product offering. As a result, we did not institute any broad pricing actions through 2023 and we saw our contribution to growth in daily sales due to price moderate throughout the year. The exception to this stability was cost deflation for imported goods, which resulted in modest price deflation specifically in our fastener product line over the course of the year. The net effect on our gross profit percentage of these trends in cost and price inflation was immaterial in 2023.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, and expenses, and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial valuations. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.\nOur most significant accounting policies, including Revenue Recognition and Inventories, are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, or estimates. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (ii) different estimates reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations. Our most critical accounting estimates include the following:\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n– This reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses is based on an income statement approach which adjusts the ending balance sheet to take into consideration expected losses over the contractual lives of the receivables, considering factors such as historical data as a basis for future expected losses. If business or economic conditions change, our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Historically, actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts and our estimation and assumption methods have not materially changed during 2024.\n– Adjustments to the valuation of inventory are based on an analysis of inventory trends including reviews of inventory levels, sales information, and the on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product. Our methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, market conditions, condition of the inventory, or liquidation value. If business or economic conditions change, our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Historically, actual required adjustments have not varied materially from estimated amounts and our estimation and assumption methods have not materially changed during 2024.\nGeneral insurance reserves\n– These reserves are for general claims related to workers' compensation, property and casualty losses, and other general liability self-insured losses. The reserves are based on an analysis of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported related to our historical claim trends. We perform ongoing reviews of our insured and uninsured risks and use this information to establish appropriate reserve levels. We analyze historical trends, claims experience, and loss development patterns to ensure the appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made. Historically, actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts and our estimation and assumption methods have not materially changed during 2024.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, if any, is contained in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 45.1% in 2024 and 45.7% in 2023. Our gross profit percentage was primarily impacted by two factors. First, we experienced unfavorable customer and product mix. This reflects relatively stronger growth from large customers, including Onsite customers, and non-fastener products, each of which tend to have a lower gross profit percentage than our business as a whole. Second, we experienced product margin pressure. In safety, over the course of the year we incurred certain costs to support our customers' short-term operations, but also to prepare for incremental volumes that we expect to materialize in 2025. Other product lines exhibited stability in product margin throughout the year, but did not recover the margin pressure that was experienced in the latter part of 2023 and faced difficult comparisons year-over-year. These factors were only slightly offset by higher price-cost, which reflects the reversal in the first half of 2024 of the negative price-cost experienced in the first half of 2023.\nSG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 25.1% in 2024 from 24.9% in 2023. We continued to invest in areas, such as Onsite, technology and analytics personnel, and sales-related travel that we view as critical to supporting future growth. We managed expenses not directly related to customer acquisition and growth more tightly, but",
