We also facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program (the \"program\") to provide certain of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions. The amounts confirmed as valid under the program and included in accounts payable were $32 million and $36 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Of the amounts confirmed as valid under the program, the amounts owed to participating financial institutions were $22 million and $23 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. All payments made under the program are recorded as a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. A downgrade in our credit rating or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions’ willingness to commit funds to, and participate in, the program. We do not believe such risk would have a material impact on our working capital or cash flows, as substantially all of our payments are made outside of the program.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we sold our Kichler business, a provider of decorative residential and light commercial lighting products, ceiling fans, and LED lighting systems, for consideration of $125 million, net of cash disposed, and subject to final closing adjustments.\nEffective October 20, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, for retirement, of up to $2.0 billion of shares of our common stock, exclusive of excise tax, in open-market transactions or otherwise. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased and retired approximately 5.1 million shares of our common stock (including 0.3 million shares to offset the dilutive impact of restricted stock units granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2025) for approximately $357 million, inclusive of excise tax of $3 million. At September 30, 2025, we had approximately $542 million remaining under the 2022 authorization. Consistent with our past practice and as part of our long-term capital allocation strategy, outside of any potential acquisitions, we anticipate using approximately $500 million of cash for share repurchases in 2025.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net cash provided by operations was $604 million, primarily driven by operating profit and the change in deferred taxes as a result of the cash tax benefit associated with immediate expensing of qualified fixed assets and research and development expenditures from the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, partially offset by changes in working capital.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net cash used for financing activities was $592 million, primarily due to $354 million for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock, $197 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $30 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interest.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net cash used for investing activities was $111 million, primarily driven by $109 million of capital expenditures.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Report contains statements that reflect our views about our future performance and constitute \"forward-looking statements\" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Our views about future performance involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forward-looking statements.

Changes in operating profit in the following business segment results discussion exclude general corporate expense, net.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS DISCUSSION\nNet sales in the Plumbing Products segment increased two percent for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. In local currencies (including sales in currencies outside their respective functional currencies), net sales increased one percent and two percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, net sales increased three percent due to higher net selling prices, partially offset by three percent due to lower sales volume. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net sales increased three percent due to higher net selling prices, partially offset by one percent due to lower sales volume.\nOperating profit in the Plumbing Products segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was negatively impacted by higher commodity and tariff costs, an increase in other expenses (including inventory-related reserves), and lower sales volume, partially offset by higher net selling prices and cost savings initiatives. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, operating profit was also negatively impacted by unfavorable sales mix and higher marketing costs.\nDecorative Architectural Products\nNet sales in the Decorative Architectural Products segment decreased 12 percent and 13 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, net sales decreased seven percent due to the divestiture of Kichler and seven percent due to lower sales volume, partially offset by one percent due to higher net selling prices. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net sales decreased eight percent due to the divestiture of Kichler and six percent due to lower sales volume.\nOperating profit in the Decorative Architectural Products segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was negatively impacted by lower sales volume and higher commodity and tariff costs, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, negative impacts to operating profit were also partially offset by higher net selling prices.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Capital Structure\nWe had cash and cash investments of approximately $559 million and $634 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts, time deposit accounts, and money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations. While we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk, it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments. Of the cash and cash investments we held at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, $303 million and $321 million, respectively, was held in our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., their repatriation into the U.S. would not result in significant additional U.S. income tax or foreign withholding tax, as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings, except for those that are legally restricted.\nWe believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations, and borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital and other investment needs. We believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings and future financial market activities. However, due to the changing market conditions and its impact on our customers and suppliers, we are unable to fully estimate the extent of the impact that the changing market conditions may have on our future financial condition.\nOn April 26, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the “2022 Credit Agreement”) with an aggregate commitment of $1.0 billion and a maturity date of April 26, 2027.\nUnder the 2022 Credit Agreement, at our request and subject to certain conditions, we can increase the aggregate commitment up to an additional $500 million with the current l"
