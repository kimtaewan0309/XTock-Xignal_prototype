Operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was 9.4% compared to an operating margin of 9.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. As described in further detail below, the quarterly increase in operating income was predominantly driven by greater contribution from our United States construction segments, due to the revenue growth they experienced, while the 40 basis point reduction in operating margin was attributable to a decrease in the operating margin of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, operating income was $1,139.7 million, an increase of $183.4 million compared to operating income of $956.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was 9.1% compared to an operating margin of 8.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 included incremental acquisition contribution of $23.3 million, net of amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets of $35.8 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, and as described in more detail below, the year-over-year increase in profitability was predominantly a result of improved operating performance within our United States construction segments, due to a more favorable mix of work and better project execution, including enhanced productivity, due in part to investments in virtual design and construction, prefabrication, and automation.\nOperating income of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment was $145.2 million, or 11.3% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $119.1 million, or 14.1% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Operating income of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $438.9 million, or 11.8% of revenues, compared to $299.3 million, or 12.4% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Largely driven by Miller Electric, this segment’s operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 included incremental acquisition contribution of $21.6 million, net of amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets of $30.8 million. The increase in operating income of this segment for both 2025 periods resulted from greater gross profit given the growth in revenues it experienced. While the most significant increase in gross profit was generated within the network and communications market sector, this segment additionally experienced increases within the majority of the other market sectors in which we operate, generally in line with the revenue trends described above. With respect to the period-over-period decreases in operating margin, this segment’s results were impacted by: (a) lower profitability on certain projects in new geographies where we encountered reduced labor productivity or availability while investing in the development of a workforce and (b) the incremental intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the acquisition of Miller Electric, which negatively impacted operating margin by approximately 90 basis points and approximately 80 basis points, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nOur United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment’s operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $229.3 million, or 12.9% of revenues, compared to operating income of $214.8 million, or 12.9% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Operating income of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $654.8 million, or 12.8% of revenues, compared to $579.0 million, or 12.2% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition to the impact of greater revenues, the operating results of this segment for both 2025 periods benefited from excellent project execution and a more favorable mix of work. From a market sector perspective, this segment experienced greater profitability across a number of the sectors in which we operate, with the most significant increase in gross profit coming from network and communications. This segment’s operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 included incremental acquisition contribution of $2.8 million, net of amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets of $3.1 million. Partially offsetting this increased profitability was a decrease in gross profit from the commercial market sector, primarily as a result of reduced revenues within such sector.\nOperating income of our United States building services segment was $59.4 million, or 7.3% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $55.6 million, or 7.0% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Operating income of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $145.9 million, or 6.2% of revenues, compared to $135.9 million, or 5.8% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For both 2025 periods, this segment’s mechanical services division continued to produce strong margins across its portfolio of HVAC retrofits, building automation and controls projects, and repair service work orders. Headwinds faced in this segment’s commercial site-based services and government site-based services divisions, given the loss of the previously referenced facilities maintenance contracts, partially offset such profitability during the first nine months of 2025. The results of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included an $11.0 million reserve for a specific customer bankruptcy within its commercial site-based services division, which negatively impacted the segment’s operating margin by 40 basis points in such prior year period.\nOur United States industrial services segment reported operating income of $6.3 million, or 2.2% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to operating income of $3.3 million, or 1.1% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Despite the increase in quarter-over-quarter profitability, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, this segment reported operating income of $12.6 million, or 1.4% of revenues, compared to operating\nincome of $34.0 million, or 3.5% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in operating income and operating margin of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily a result of: (a) the reductions in segment revenues discussed above, which also resulted in a greater amount of unabsorbed labor costs, and (b) a less favorable revenue mix when compared to the prior year period, which benefited from turnaround projects of a greater size as well as a large renewable fuel project.\nOperating income of our United Kingdom building services segment was $7.6 million, or 5.6% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $5.5 million, or 5.2% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $21.0 million, or 5.6% of revenues, compared to $16.7 million, or 5.2% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For both 2025 periods, the increase in this segment’s operating income and operating margin was due to the revenue growth it experienced, which resulted in: (a) greater gross profit and (b) a reduction in SG&A margin as our segment management team leveraged its overhead cost structure. In addition, operating income and operating margin of this segment for the three months ended September 30, 2025 benefited from an increase in gross profit margin given a more favorable project mix largely within the network and communications and manufacturing and industrial market sectors. Operating income of this segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were positively impacted by $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, as a result of favorable exchange rate movements for the British pound versus the United States dollar.\nOur corporate administration expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 were $42.0 million, compared to $34.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our corporate administration expenses were $133.5 million, compared to $108.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Corporate expenses for the first nine months of 2025 included $9.4 million of transaction related costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of Miller Electric. Excluding these items, the increase in corporate expenses for both 2025 periods was primarily a result of greater: (a) computer hardware and software costs, due to various information technology and cybersecurity initiatives currently in process, and (b) employment expenses, partially due to additional headcount to support our growth as well as annual cost of living adjustments.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, net interest income was $1.8 million, compared to net interest income of $8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
