Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to\nhigher federal tax payments of $471.0 million, which included $187.0 million of fiscal 2023 federal tax payments that were paid in fiscal 2024 as a result of payment deadline extensions due to IRS tax relief for the California winter storms.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $1.2 billion for fiscal 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $482.1 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by net cash proceeds of $1.4 billion from the\nSoftware Integrity Divestiture,\nlower cash paid for acquisitions of $140.7 million, lower purchases of property and equipment of $66.5 million and higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments of $55.7 million.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nThe decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower stock repurchases of $1.2 billion, as we have suspended the Program in connection with the pending Ansys Merger until we reduce our expected debt levels, partially offset by higher taxes paid for net share settlements of $96.1 million, the payment of costs related to the Bridge Commitment and the Term Loan of $72.3 million in connection with the Ansys Merger, and lower proceeds from issuance of common stock of $20.8 million.\nBridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into the Bridge Commitment Letter with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, the Bridge Commitment. The Bridge Commitment currently provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to $10.6 billion. The proceeds of any borrowing under the Bridge Commitment will be used for the purpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Ansys Merger and paying related fees and expenses in connection with the Ansys Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe commitments to provide the Bridge Commitment may be terminated in whole or reduced in part, at our discretion. In addition, the Bridge Commitment Letter provides that net cash proceeds received from certain debt and equity issuances or the sale of certain businesses and assets, including the Software Integrity Divestiture, as well as term loan commitments under certain qualifying term loan facilities, will result in mandatory commitment reductions under the Bridge Commitment. On October 3, 2024, we reduced the Bridge Commitment by $1.1 billion to $10.6 billion following the closing of the Software Integrity Divestiture.\nOn February 13, 2024, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement in connection with the financing of the pending Ansys Merger. The Term Loan Agreement provides us with the ability to borrow up to $4.3 billion at the closing of\nthe Ansys Merger, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions for similar facilities, for the purpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Ansys Merger and paying related fees and expenses in connection with the Ansys Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe Term Loan Agreement provides for two tranches of senior unsecured term loans: a $1.45 billion tranche (Tranche 1) that matures two years after funding and a $2.85 billion tranche (Tranche 2) that matures three years after funding. There was no outstanding balance under the Term Loan Agreement as of October 31, 2024.\nUnder the Term Loan Agreement, borrowings will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at a floating rate based on, at Synopsys’ election, (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Synopsys ranging from 0.875% to 1.375% (in the case of Tranche 1) or 1.000% to 1.500% (in the case of Tranche 2) or (ii) the ABR (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Synopsys ranging from 0.000% to 0.375% (in the case of Tranche 1) or 0.000% to 0.500% (in the case of Tranche 2).\nOn May 14, 2024, a ticking fee began to accrue under the Term Loan Agreement in an amount equal to a rate per annum equal to 0.10% times the actual daily undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of the term loan facility. This ticking fee will accrue until the earlier of (i) termination or expiration of the commitments under the term loan facility or (ii) the funding of the commitments, at which point the accrued amount of the ticking fee will become payable.\nThe Term Loan Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring that Synopsys maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio commencing the last day of the first fiscal quarter ending on or after the completion of the Ansys Merger, as well as other non-financial covenants.\nOn February 13, 2024, we entered into a Sixth Amendment Agreement (the Sixth Amendment), which amended and restated our previous revolving credit agreement, dated as of December 14, 2022 (as amended and restated, the Revolving Credit Agreement).\nUnder the Sixth Amendment, certain amendments became effective on February 13, 2024 and certain additional amendments will become effective upon the completion of the Ansys Merger. Upon the effective date, the Sixth Amendment amended the financial covenant to allow netting of the cash proceeds of certain debt incurred to finance the Ansys Merger as well as certain other modifications set forth therein. Upon the completion of the Ansys Merger, the Sixth Amendment, among other things:\namends the applicable margin used to determine the interest that accrues on loans and the facility fee payable under the revolving credit facility to be based on our credit ratings;\namends the financial covenant thresholds under the financial covenant in the Revolving Credit Agreement requiring us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio; and\namends certain conditions to borrowing, other non-financial covenants and events of default.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement provides an unsecured $850.0 million committed multicurrency revolving credit facility and an unsecured uncommitted incremental revolving loan facility of up to $150.0 million. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is December 14, 2027, which may be extended at our option. There was no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023.\nInterest accrues on dollar-denominated loans at a floating rate based on, at Synopsys’ election, (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin or (ii) the ABR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR Rate based loans ranges from 0.785% to 0.975%, based upon Synopsys’ consolidated leverage ratio. The applicable margin for ABR based loans is 0.000%. In addition to the interest on any outstanding loans, Synopsys is also required to pay a facility fee on the entire portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from 0.09% to 0.15% based on Synopsys’ consolidated leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.\nSubject to the completion of the Ansys Merger, interest under the Revolving Credit Agreement will accrue on dollar-denominated loans at a floating rate based on, at Synopsys’ election, (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus an applicable margin based on our credit ratings ranging from 0.795% to 1.200% or (ii) the ABR plus an applicable margin based on our credit ratings ranging from 0.000% to 0.200%. In addition to the interest on any outstanding loans, Synopsys will also be required to pay a facility fee on the entire portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from 0.080% to 0.175% based on the credit ratings of Synopsys on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, as well as other non-financial covenants. As of October 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenant.\nIn July 2018, we entered into a 12-year 220.0 million Renminbi (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in China to support our facilities expansion. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5-year Loan Prime Rate plus 0.74%. As of October 31, 2024, we had a $15.6 million outstanding balance under the agreement.\nBridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin this Annual Report for further discussion.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn fiscal 2022, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (the Program) with authorization to purchase up to\nof our common stock. As of\nremained available for future stock repurchases under the Program. In connection with the pending Ansys Merger, we have suspended our stock repurchase program until we reduce our expected debt levels.\nThe IR Act was enacted in the United States on August 16, 2022. The IR Act imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchases made by covered corporations after December 31, 2022. The total taxable value of shares repurchased is reduced by the fair market value of any newly issued shares during the taxable year.\nAs of October 31, 2024, this does not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRisks related to the IR Act are described in Part I, Item 1A,\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\nWe have operating lease arrangements for office space, data center, equipment and other corporate assets. As of\n, we had lease payment obligations, net of immaterial sublease income, of $631.0 million, with $93.2 million payable within 12 months.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services. As of\n, we had $650.0 million of purchase obligations, with $558.5 million payable within 12 months. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms may allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.\nRefer to \"Bridge Commitment Letter, Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities” under Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nincluded in this Annual Report for more information.\nLong Term Accrued Income Taxes\n, we had $18.8 million of long-term accrued income taxes which represent uncertain tax benefits. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2024 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income from continuing operations attributed to Synopsys\nNet income from discontinued operations attributed to Synopsys\nDiluted net income per share attributed to Synopsys:\nContinuing operations\nDiscontinued operations\nFiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 financial performance summary\nRevenues were $6.1 billion, an increase of $809.4 million or 15%, primarily due to revenue growth across all products and geographies.\nTotal cost of revenue and operating expenses was $4.8 billion, an increase of $726.9 million or 18%, primarily due to an increase of $325.8 million in employee-related costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions.\nOperating income was $1.4 billion, an increase of $82.5 million or 6%.\nNet income from discontinued operations was $821.7 million, an increase of $818.9 million, primarily due to the gain on Software Integrity Divestiture.\nFiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 financial performance summary\nRevenues were $5.3 billion, an increase of $702.3 million or 15%, primarily due to revenue growth across all products and geographies.\nTotal cost of revenue and operating expenses was $4.0 billion, an increase of $577.8 million or 17%, primarily due to an increase of $246.7 million in employee-related costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions.\nOperating income was $1.3 billion, an increase of $124.5 million or 11%.\nSynopsys delivers trusted and comprehensive silicon to systems design solutions, from EDA, including system verification and validation solutions, to silicon IP.

We are catalyzing the era of pervasive intelligence, powering innovation today that ignites the ingenuity of tomorrow. For more information about our business segments and product groups, see Part I, Item 1\nof this Annual Report.\nWe have consistently grown our revenue since 2005, despite periods of global economic uncertainty. We achieved these results because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, and because we generally recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. See Note 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Polices and Basis of Presentation\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin this Annual Report for a discussion on our revenue recognition policy\nThe revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. As a result, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenue in a significant way.\nOur growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our Design Automation products, expanding and proliferating our Design IP offerings and continuing to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market. Our revenue growth from period to period is expected to vary based on the mix of our time based and upfront products. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.\nPending Acquisition of Ansys\nOn January 15, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Ansys, a provider of broad engineering simulation and analysis software and services, in a cash-and-stock transaction (the Ansys Merger) that values Ansys at approximately $35.0 billion, based on the closing price of Synopsys common stock on December 21, 2023.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Ansys Merger (the Effective Time), each share of Ansys common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (with certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be converted ",
