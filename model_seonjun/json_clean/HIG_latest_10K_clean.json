Business\nREPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND CORPORATE\nThe Hartford conducts business principally in five reportable segments, including\nBusiness Insurance (formerly \"Commercial Lines\"), Personal Insurance (formerly \"Personal Lines\"), Property & Casualty Other Operations, Employee Benefits (formerly \"Group Benefits\") and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category.\nThe following discussion describes the principal products and services, marketing and distribution, and competition of The Hartford's reportable segments. For further discussion of the reportable segments, including financial disclosures of revenues by product line, net income (loss), and assets for each reportable segment, see Note 3 - Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2024 Revenues of $26,535 by Segment/Category\n[1]Includes Revenue of $70 for Property & Casualty Other Operations and $147 for Corporate.\nBUSINESS INSURANCE\n2024 Earned Premiums of $12,721 by Line of Business\n\nWorkers' Compensation\nCovers employers for losses incurred due to employees sustaining an injury, illness or disability in connection with their work. Benefits paid under workers’ compensation policies may include reimbursement of medical care costs, replacement income, compensation for permanent injuries and benefits to survivors. Workers’ compensation is provided under both guaranteed cost policies (coverage for a fixed premium) and loss sensitive policies where premiums are adjustable based on the loss experience of the employer.\nCovers a business in the event it is sued for causing harm to a person and/or damage to property. General liability insurance covers third-party claims arising from accidents occurring on the insured’s premises or arising out of their operations. General liability insurance may also cover losses arising from product liability.\nEncompasses various ocean and inland marine coverages including cargo, craft, hull, specie, transport and liability, among others.\nCovers both commercial property and general liability damages.\nCovers the building a business owns or leases as well as its personal property, including tools and equipment, inventory, and furniture. A commercial property insurance policy covers losses resulting from fire, wind, hail, earthquake, theft and other covered perils, including coverage for assets such as accounts receivable and valuable papers and records. Commercial property may include specialized equipment insurance, which provides coverage for loss or damage resulting from the mechanical breakdown of boilers and machinery. A commercial property insurance policy may also provide replacement of lost income resulting from a covered loss that interrupts business operations.\nProfessional Liability\nCovers liability arising from directors and officers acting in their official capacity and liability for errors and omissions committed by professionals and others. Coverage may also provide employment practices insurance relating to allegations of wrongful termination and discrimination.\nEncompasses fidelity and surety insurance, including commercial surety, contract surety and fidelity bonds. Commercial surety includes bonds that insure non-performance by contractors, license and permit bonds to help meet government-mandated requirements and probate and judicial bonds for fiduciaries and civil court proceedings. Contract surety bonds may include payment and performance bonds for contractors. Fidelity bonds may include ERISA bonds related to the handling of retirement plan assets and bonds protecting against employee theft or fraud. The Company also provides credit and political risk insurance (\"CPRI\") offered to clients with global operations.\nIncludes assumed reinsurance of property, liability, surety, credit and political, marine and agriculture risks throughout the world but principally in Europe and the Americas. Business principally provides coverage on broad books of business (i.e. treaty), as opposed to individual risks (i.e. facultative).\nCommercial Automobile\nCovers damage to a business's fleet of vehicles due to collision or other perils (automobile physical damage). In addition to first party automobile physical damage, commercial automobile covers liability for bodily injuries and property damage suffered by third parties and losses caused by uninsured or under-insured motorists.\nThrough its three lines of business,\nsmall business (formerly \"small commercial\"), middle & large business (formerly \"middle & large commercial\"), and global specialty, Business Insurance offers its products and services to businesses in the United States (\"U.S.\") and internationally. Business Insurance generally consists of products written for small businesses and middle market companies as well as national and multi-national accounts, largely distributed through retail agents and brokers, wholesale agents and global and specialty insurance and reinsurance brokers. The majority of Business Insurance written premium is generated by small business and middle market lines, which provide coverage options and customized pricing based on the policyholder’s individual risk characteristics.\nSmall business provides coverages for small businesses, which the Company generally considers to be businesses with an annual payroll under $20, revenues under $50 and property values less than $20 per location. Primary coverages provided include workers' compensation, property, general liability and commercial automobile. Within small business, both property and general liability coverages are offered under a single package policy, marketed under the Spectrum name. Small business also provides excess and surplus lines coverage to small businesses including umbrella, general liability, property and other coverages.\nMiddle & large business provides insurance coverages to medium-sized and national accounts businesses, which are companies whose payroll, revenue and property values exceed\nthe small business definition. In addition to offering standard commercial lines products, including workers' compensation, property, general liability and commercial automobile products, middle & large business includes program business which provides tailored programs, primarily to customers with common risk characteristics. For national accounts, a significant portion of the business is written through large deductible programs. Other programs written within middle & large business are retrospectively-rated where the ultimate premium collected from the insured is adjusted based on how incurred losses for the policy year develop over time, subject to a minimum and maximum premium. Also within middle & large business, the Company writes captive programs business, which provides tailored programs to those seeking a loss sensitive solution where premiums are adjustable based on loss experience. In addition, through business partners, middle & large business offers business insurance coverages to exporters and other U.S. companies with a physical presence overseas.\nLines of business written by small business and middle & large business are subject to rate regulation and written pricing increases or decreases that are partly in response to loss cost trends. Workers’ compensation rates are based on loss experience and are informed by data submitted through the National Council on Compensation Insurance (\"NCCI\"). Workers’ compensation rates have been under downward pressure for the industry due to favorable loss cost trends in recent years.\nPart I - Item 1. Business\nGlobal specialty provides a variety of customized insurance products, including property, general liability, marine, professional liability, and bond. In the U.S., global specialty serves both the admitted and non-admitted markets and produces business through both wholesale and retail brokers. Global specialty also offers various products internationally as a sole corporate member of Lloyd’s Syndica",
  "item7_clean": "[1] Primarily represents the federal income tax expense (benefit) related to before tax items not included in core earnings.\nCore Earnings Margin-\nThe Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings margin to evaluate, and believes it is an important measure of, the Employee Benefits segment's operating performance. Core earnings margin is calculated by dividing core earnings by revenues, excluding buyouts and realized gains (losses). Net income margin, calculated by dividing net income by revenues, is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of Employee Benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and realized gains (losses) as well as other items excluded in the calculation of core earnings. Core earnings margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of Employee Benefits. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both core earnings margin and net income margin when reviewing performance. A reconciliation of net income margin to core earnings margin is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Employee Benefits.\nCurrent Accident Year Catastrophe Ratio-\nA component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, represents the ratio of catastrophe losses incurred in the current accident year (\"CAY\") (net of reinsurance) to earned premiums. For U.S. events, a catastrophe is an event that causes $25 or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers, as defined by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk. For international events, the Company's approach is similar, informed, in part, by how Lloyd's of London defines major losses. Lloyd's of London is an insurance market-place operating worldwide (\"Lloyd's\"). Lloyd's does not underwrite risks. The Company accepts risks as the sole member of Lloyd's Syndicate 1221 (\"Lloyd's Syndicate\"). The current accident year catastrophe ratio includes the effect of catastrophe losses, but does not include the effect of reinstatement premiums.\nFor Business Insurance and Personal Insurance is the ratio of underwriting expenses less fee income, to earned premiums. Underwriting expenses include the\namortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (\"DAC\"), amortization of other intangible assets and insurance operating costs and other expenses, including certain centralized services costs and bad debt expense. DAC includes commissions, taxes, licenses and fees and other incremental direct underwriting expenses and are amortized over the policy term.\nThe expense ratio for Employee Benefits is expressed as the ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses including amortization of intangibles and amortization of DAC, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums.\nThe expense ratio for Business Insurance, Personal Insurance and Employee Benefits does not include integration and other transaction costs associated with an acquired business.\nIs largely driven from amounts earned as a result of contractually defined percentages of AUM in our Hartford Funds business. These fees are generally earned on a daily basis. Therefore, this fee income increases or decreases with the rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.\nGross New Business Premium-\nRepresents the amount of premiums charged, before ceded reinsurance, for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. Gross new business premium plus gross renewal written premium less ceded reinsurance equals total written premium.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio-\nA measure of the cost of claims incurred in the calendar year divided by earned premium and includes losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for both the current and prior accident years. Among other factors, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio needed for the Company to achieve its targeted return on equity (\"ROE\") fluctuates from year to year based on changes in the expected investment yield over the claim settlement period, the timing of expected claim settlements and the targeted returns set by management based on the competitive environment.\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is affected by claim frequency and claim severity, particularly for shorter-tail property lines of business, where the emergence of claim frequency and severity is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. Claim frequency represents the percentage change in the average number of reported claims per unit of exposure in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. Claim severity represents the percentage change in the estimated average cost per claim in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. As one of the factors used to determine pricing, the Company’s practice is to first make an overall assumption about claim frequency and severity for a given line of business and then, as part of the rate-making process, adjust the assumption as appropriate for the particular state, product or coverage.\nUnderlying Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio-\nThis non-GAAP financial measure is the cost of non-catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current accident year divided by earned premiums. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year development (\"PYD\"). A reconciliation of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio to the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is set forth in the Reportable Segment and Corporate Operating Summaries section within MD&A.\nLoss Ratio, excluding Buyouts-\nUtilized for the Employee Benefits segment and is expressed as a ratio of benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses, excluding those related to buyout premiums, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. Since Employee Benefits occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the Company excludes this buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the profitability of the business as buyouts may distort the loss ratio. Buyout premiums represent takeover of open claim liabilities and other non-recurring premium amounts.\nNet investment income excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments-\nThis non-GAAP measure is the amount of net investment income on a consolidated level earned from invested assets, excluding the net investment income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments. The Company believes that net investment income excluding limited partnerships and other alternative instruments, provides investors with an important measure of the trend in investment earnings because it excludes the impact of the volatility in returns related to limited partnerships and other alternative instruments. Net investment income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of net investment income to net investment income excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments - is set forth in the Investment Results section within MD&A.\nMutual Fund and Exchange-Traded Fund Assets-\nAre owned by the shareowners of those products and not by the Company and, therefore, are not reflected in the Company’s\nConsolidated Financial Statements, except in instances where the Company seeds new investment products.\nMutual fund and ETF assets are a measure used by the Company primarily because a significant portion of the Company’s Hartford Funds segment revenues and expenses are based upon asset values. These revenues and expenses increase or decrease with a rise or fall in AUM whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.\nNet New Business Premium-\nRepresents the amount of premiums charged, after ceded reinsurance, for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. Net new business premium plus renewal written premium equals total written premium.\nPolicy Count Retention-\nRepresents the number of renewal policies issued during the current year period divided by the new and renewal policies issued in the prior period. Policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the Company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain classes of business or states. Policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by us and competitors.\nEffective Policy Count Retention-\nRepresents the number of policies expected to renew in the current year period, based on contract effective dates, divided by the new and renewal policies effective in the prior period. Effective policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the Company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain classes of business or states. Effective policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by us and competitors, as well as the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals by customers. Effective policy count retention statistics are subject to change from period to period based on the effect of differences between actual and expected policy cancellations throughout the policy period.\nRepresents the number of policies with coverage in effect as of the end of the period. The number of policies in-force is a growth measure used for Personal Insurance, small business, and middle market lines within middle & large business, and is affected by both new business growth and policy count retention.\nPolicyholder Dividend Ratio-\nThe ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium.\nFor middle & large business, represents the ratio of prior period premiums that were successfully renewed divided by premiums associated with policies available for renewal in the current period. Premium retention excludes premium amounts from annual audits, renewal written price increases and changes in exposure, including amount of insurance. Premium retention statistics are subject to change from period to period based on a number of factors, including the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPrior Accident Year Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Ratio-\nRepresents the increase (decrease) in the estimated cost of settling catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims incurred in prior accident years as recorded in the current calendar year divided by earned premiums.\nReinstatement Premiums-\nRepresents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of the Company ceding losses to reinsurers.\nRenewal Earned Price Increase (Decrease)-\nWritten premiums are earned over the policy term, which is six months for certain personal automobile business and twelve months for substantially all of the remainder of the Company’s P&C business. Since the Company earns premiums over the six to twelve month term of the policies, renewal earned price increases (decreases) lag renewal written price increases (decreases) by six to twelve months.\nRenewal Written Price Increase (Decrease)-\nFor Business Insurance, represents the combined effect of rate changes, and individual risk pricing decisions per unit of exposure on policies that renewed and includes amount of insurance. For Personal Insurance, renewal written price increases represent the total change in premium per policy since the prior year on those policies that renewed and includes the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and other changes in exposure. For Personal Insurance, other changes in exposure include, but are not limited to, the effect of changes in number of drivers, vehicles and incidents, as well as changes in customer policy elections, such as deductibles and limits. The rate component represents the change in rate impacting renewal policies as previously filed with and approved by state regulators during the period. Amount of insurance represents the change in the value of the rating base, such as model year/vehicle symbol for automobiles, building replacement costs for property and wage inflation for workers’ compensation. A number of factors affect renewal written price increases (decreases) including expected loss costs as projected by the Company’s pricing actuaries, rate filings approved by state regulators, risk selection decisions made by the Company’s underwriters and marketplace competition. Renewal written price changes reflect the property and casualty insurance market cycle. Prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. Prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. Renewal written price statistics are subject to change from period to period, based on a number of factors, including changes in actuarial estimates and the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals, and modifications made to better reflect ultimate pricing achieved.\nReturn on Assets (\"ROA\"), Core Earnings-\nThe Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, the Hartford Funds segment’s operating performance. ROA, core earnings is calculated by dividing annualized core earnings by a daily average AUM. ROA is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Company believes that ROA, core earnings, provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the Hartford Funds segment because it reveals trends in our business that may be obscured by the effect of items excluded in the calculation of core earnings. ROA, core earnings, should not be considered as a substitute for ROA and does not reflect the overall profitability of our Hartford Funds business. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both ROA, and ROA, core earnings when reviewing the Hartford Funds segment performance. A reconciliation of ROA to ROA, core earnings is set forth in the Results of Operations section within MD&A - Hartford Funds.\nUnderlying Combined Ratio-\nThis non-GAAP financial measure of underwriting results represents the combined ratio before catastrophes, prior accident year development and current accident year change in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development. The changes to loss reserves upon acquisition of a business are excluded from underlying combined ratio because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prio",
