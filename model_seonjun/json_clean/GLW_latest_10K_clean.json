  "item7_clean": "Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $530 million, or 4%, when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in sales for telecommunication products of $645 million and specialty glass products of $146 million, partially offset by a decrease in sales for polycrystalline silicon products of $149 million and environmental substrate and filter products of $95 million. Refer to the “Segment Analysis” section of our MD&A below for a discussion of net sales by segment.\nIn 2024 and 2023, sales in international markets accounted for 64% and 67% of total net sales, respectively.\nCost of Sales / Gross Margin\nThe types of expenses included in cost of sales are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; freight and logistics costs; and other production overhead.\nGross margin increased by $345 million, or 9% and gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased by 2 percentage points when compared to 2023. The increase in gross margin is primarily driven by the increase in net sales, as discussed above. Since 2023, actions were taken by management to improve profitability, including raising prices, restoring our productivity levels and normalizing inventory levels, which has resulted in improvements in gross margin as a percentage of net sales.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe types of expenses included in selling, general and administrative expenses are: salaries, wages and benefits, including variable compensation and share-based compensation expense; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities and rent for administrative facilities.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $88 million, or 5%, when compared to 2023 primarily due to the increase in net sales, as discussed above, and remained consistent as a percentage of net sales.\nResearch, Development and Engineering Expenses\nResearch, development and engineering expenses increased by $13 million, or 1%, and decreased as a percentage of net sales by 1 percentage point when compared to 2023.\nTranslated earnings contract gain, net\nIncluded in translated earnings contract gain, net, is the impact of foreign currency contracts which economically hedge the translation exposure arising from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, euro, Chinese yuan, Mexican peso and British pound and its impact on net income.\nThe following table provides detailed information on the impact of translated earnings contract gain, net (in millions):\nHedges related to translated earnings:\n\nRefer to Note 17 (Reportable Segments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to consolidated net income.\nOptical Communications\nThe increase in segment net income was primarily driven by strong incremental profit on higher sales volume, as outlined above.\nDisplay Technologies\nThe increase in segment net income was primarily driven by the increase in sales, as outlined above, and improved profitability which includes the impact of price increases.\nThe increase in segment net income was primarily driven by strong incremental profit on higher volumes.\nEnvironmental Technologies\nThe decrease in segment net income was primarily driven by the decrease in sales, as outlined above.\nThe increase in segment net income was primarily driven by profitability improvements from productivity actions taken.\nHemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses\nThe decrease was primarily driven by our HSG business due to lower sales, as outlined above.\nCORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nIn managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures included in our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at our core performance measures. These items include the impact of translating the Japanese yen-denominated debt, the impact of the translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments, restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits, certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect the ongoing operating results of the Company.\nIn addition, because a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is important to understand the impact on sales and net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. Therefore, management utilizes constant-currency reporting for the Display Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments to exclude the impact from the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, New Taiwan dollar and euro, as applicable to the segment. In addition, effective January 1, 2024, the Company began utilizing constant-currency reporting for the Optical Communications segment to exclude the impact from the Mexican peso on segment results. Prior periods were not recast as the impact was not material. The most significant constant-currency adjustment relates to the Japanese yen exposure within the Display Technologies segment. The constant-currency rates established for our core performance measures are internally derived long-term management estimates, which are closely aligned with our hedging instrument rates. These hedging instruments may include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange forward or option contracts and foreign-denominated debt. For details of the rates used, refer to the footnotes to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” section.\nWe believe that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, analyze underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts.\nCore performance measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We provide investors with these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our results as we believe they are indicative of our core operating performance and provide greater transparency to how management evaluates our results and trends and makes financial and operational decisions. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because management does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of management’s control. As a result, management is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.\nFor a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.”\nResults of Operations – Core Performance Measures\nThe following table presents selected highlights from our operations, excluding certain items, (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear ended December 31,\n\nU.S. dollar revolving credit facility\nChinese yuan facilities\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe ended 2024 with $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents.
