We contributed $12 million and $78 million to our investments during the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Devon early redeemed the $485 million of 5.85% senior notes due in December 2025 pursuant to the “par-call” rights set forth in the indenture document.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Devon issued $1.25 billion of $5.20% senior notes due 2034 and $1.0 billion of 5.75% senior notes due 2054. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2024, Devon borrowed $1.0 billion on the Term Loan. These debt issuances helped fund the Grayson Mill acquisition. In the third quarter of 2024, Devon retired $472 million of debt.\nShareholder Distributions and Stock Activity\nWe repurchased approximately 23.7 million shares of common stock for $800 million and approximately 16.3 million shares of common stock for $744 million under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. For additional information, see\nin “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” in this report.\n\n– The most uncertain and volatile variables for our operating cash flow are the prices of the oil, gas and NGLs we produce and sell. Prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather, changes in public policy, including the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. or other countries, and other highly variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors, which are difficult to predict, create volatility in prices and are beyond our control.\nTo mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk. The key terms to our oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2025 are presented in\nin “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” of this report.\nFurther, when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position, we expect to achieve our capital investment priorities. We remain committed to capital discipline and focused on delivering the objectives that underpin our capital plan for 2025. However, if commodity prices decline further, we will adapt our plan by reducing activity in order to maximize free cash flow.\n– Commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses. Significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities. As a result, the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and materials may also decrease, causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline. However, the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices.\n\nCritical Accounting Est\nPeriodically, we acquire assets and assume liabilities in transactions accounted for as business combinations, such as the acquisition of the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill. In connection with the acquisition, we allocated the $5.0 billion of purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.\nWe made a number of assumptions in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties. Since sufficient market data was not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, we prepared estimates and engaged third-party valuation experts. Significant judgments and assumptions are inherent in these estimates and include, among other things, estimates of reserve quantities, estimates of future commodity prices, drilling plans, expected development costs, lease operating costs, reserve risk adjustment factors and an estimate of an applicable market participant discount rate that reflects the risk of the underlying cash flow estimates.\nEstimated fair values ascribed to assets acquired can have a significant impact on future results of operations presented in Devon’s financial statements. A higher fair value ascribed to a property results in higher DD&A expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserve quantities, development costs and operating costs. In the event that future commodity prices or reserve quantities are lower than those used as inputs to determine estimates of acquisition date fair values, the likelihood increases that certain costs may be determined to not be recoverable.\nFor additional information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our\n\nWe utilize “core earnings attributable to Devon” and “core earnings per share attributable to Devon” that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not alternatives to GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under GAAP. Core earnings attributable to Devon, as well as the per share amount, represent net earnings excluding certain non-cash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our financial results. Our non-GAAP measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure. Amounts excluded relate to asset dispositions, non-cash asset impairments (including unproved asset impairments), change in tax laws, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and restructuring and transaction costs.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts. We also believe these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers.\n\nWe are committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our Board of Directors will consider a number of factors when setting the quarterly dividend, if any, including a general target of paying out approximately 10% of operating cash flow through the fixed dividend. In addition to the fixed quarterly dividend, we may pay a variable dividend or complete share repurchases. The declaration and payment of any future dividend, whether fixed or variable, will remain at the full discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nIn November 2025, Devon announced a cash dividend in the amount of $0.24 per share payable in the fourth quarter of 2025 and will total approximately $150 million.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized a $5.0 billion share repurchase program that expires on June 30, 2026. Through October 2025, we had executed $4.2 billion of the authorized program.\nCapital Expenditures\n\nProduction totaled 853 MBoe/d, exceeding guidance by 2%.\nAs of September 30, 2025, completed approximately 83% of our authorized $5.0 billion share repurchase program with approximately 92.7 million of our common shares purchased for approximately $4.1 billion, or $44.70 per share since inception of the plan.\nExited with $4.3 billion of liquidity, including $1.3 billion of cash.\nGenerated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow and $6.8 billion for the past twelve trailing months.\nPaid dividends of $151 million and have declared approximately $150 million of dividends to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nEarly redeemed the $485 million of 5.85% senior notes due December 15, 2025.\nClosed acquisition of outstanding noncontrolling interests in Cotton Draw Midstream for $260 million.\nEarnings attributable to Devon were $687 million, or $1.09 per diluted share.\nCore earnings (Non-GAAP) were $656 million, or $1.04 per diluted share.\n\nDivestitures of Property, Equipment and Investments\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, we generated additional cash flow by monetizing our investment in Matterhorn for $372 million and divesting headquarters-related real estate assets for $134 million as part of our real estate rationalization initiatives. These proceeds will be used to further strengthen our investment-grade financial position. For additional information regarding these divestitures, see\n, respectively, in “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” in this report.\nDuring the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, we received $20 million in contingent earnout payments related to assets previously sold. For additional information, see\nin “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” in this report.\n\nproportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts. We utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers, joint interest owners and counterparties. Such mechanisms include, under certain conditions, requiring letters of credit, prepayments or cash collateral postings.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had approximately $3.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Facility. This credit facility supports our $3.0 billion of short-term credit under our commercial paper program. At September 30, 2025, there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program, and we were in compliance with the Senior Credit Facility’s financial covenant.\n\nOn July 4, 2025, OBBB was signed into law. As a result, Devon’s third quarter 2025 income tax expense included a current tax benefit of approximately $155 million and corresponding deferred tax expense associated with"
