(\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to helping people around the world save money and live better by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve approximately 270 million customers who visit more than 10,750 stores and numerous eCommerce websites in 19 countries.\nOur strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.\nOur operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of, and for the fiscal years ended, January 31, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\"), January 31, 2024 (\"fiscal 2024\") and January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"). During fiscal 2025, we generated total revenues of $681.0 billion, which primarily comprised net sales of $674.5 billion.\nWe maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"WMT.\"\nThe Development of Our Company\nThe businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores, at which time we began to open discount stores. We completed our initial public offering in 1970. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2025, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 18 countries.\nIn 1996, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site-to-Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,000 pickup and delivery locations globally. In 2018, we expanded our eCommerce and digital presence through acquisitions with our majority stakes in Flipkart and PhonePe in India. We continue to heavily invest in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, which enables us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, and expand our assortment and service offerings.\nWe are enhancing our omni-channel capabilities through a combination of stores, eCommerce websites and service offerings, as well as our supply chain, combined with approximately 2.1 million associates as of January 31, 2025, to better serve our customers. Together, these elements produce a global retail ecosystem that we believe allows customers to view Walmart as their primary retail destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on our strategy globally, our business is expanding through offerings such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, and financial services. These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our omni-channel model centered on our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.\nInformation About Our Segments\nWe are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S., which are further described below. Each segment contributes to the Company's operating results differently. However, each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic information is contained in\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWalmart U.S. Segment\nWalmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates 4,605 stores in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, including walmart.com. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $462.4 billion for fiscal 2025, representing 69% of our fiscal 2025 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $441.8 billion and $420.6 billion for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWalmart U.S. provides a convenient and seamless omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce. Substantially all our stores provide same-day pickup and delivery, including offerings such as express delivery within 90 minutes, in-home delivery and digital pharmacy fulfillment options. Our Walmart+ membership offering provides enhanced omni-channel shopping benefits including unlimited free shipping on eligible items with no order minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel discounts, mobile Scan & Go and access to additional member benefits. The following table provides the approximate size of our retail stores as of January 31, 2025:\nSupercenters (general merchandise and grocery)\nDiscount stores (general merchandise and limited grocery)\nNeighborhood markets\nExcludes other small formats.\nMerchandise and Other Offerings.\nWalmart U.S. does business primarily in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:\nGrocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat, produce, deli and bakery, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, pet supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products;\nGeneral merchandise includes:\nEntertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music and books);\nHardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery);\nFashion (e.g., apparel for adults and children, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and\nHome (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed and bath, furniture and home organization, home furnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts).\nHealth and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, and optical services.\nPeriodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.\nBrand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: \"Allswell,\" \"Athletic Works,\" \"bettergoods,\" \"Equate,\" \"Free Assembly,\" \"Freshness Guaranteed,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Hyper Tough,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside,\" \"No Boundaries,\" \"onn.,\" \"Ozark Trail,\" \"Parent's Choice,\" \"Sam's Choice,\" \"Scoop,\" \"Spring Valley,\" \"Time and Tru,\" \"Way to Celebrate\" and \"Wonder Nation.\" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: \"Avia,\" \"Better Homes & Gardens,\" \"Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara,\" and \"The Pioneer Woman.\"\nOther offerings in the Walmart U.S. business include in-house advertising for brands and online marketplace sellers, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers, and data analytics and insights for merchants and suppliers.\n\nAdditional offerings include fuel, financial services and related products such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment and certain types of installment lending.\nWe continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 164 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2025, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations by leveraging our ability to deliver directly from stores and shipping from our 29 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers.\nWalmart International Segment\nWalmart International is our second largest segment and operates 5,566 stores across 18 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and Africa (which includes Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, and Zambia), and our majority-owned subsidiaries in India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua).\nWalmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, warehouse clubs (including our membership-only Sam's Club format) and cash and carry, as well as eCommerce through websites and mobile applications, including walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com, PhonePe and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $121.9 billion for fiscal 2025, representing 18% of our fiscal 2025 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $114.6 billion and $101.0 billion for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWalmart International's strategy is to bring Walmart to the world and the world to Walmart, which means we help millions of customers and members save money and live better every day by leveraging our global ecosystem and deep local expertise to provide access to affordable products and services. In addition, we share what we learn in our markets to help the enterprise innovate and grow even faster. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years:\nBought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiar",
  "item7_clean": "Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 4.8% and 4.9% in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 4.8% and 5.5% in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. For fiscal 2025, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in transactions and unit volumes, with strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. For fiscal 2024, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness.Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.9% and 2.6% to comparable sales for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which was primarily driven by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery.\nComparable sales at Sam's Club U.S. increased 4.7% and 2.3% in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. For fiscal 2025, Sam's Club U.S. comparable sales increased due to growth in transactions and unit volumes, with strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Sam's Club U.S. comparable sales for fiscal 2024 increased due to growth in transactions and average ticket,\nincluding strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Additionally, fiscal 2025 and 2024 growth was partially offset by lower fuel sales primarily due to lower market prices. Sam's Club U.S. eCommerce sales\ncontributed approximately 2.3% and 1.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which was primarily driven by club-fulfilled curbside pickup and delivery.\nOur objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a combination of productivity improvements as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") expenses. Additionally, we focus on our mix of businesses, including expanding our ecosystem in higher margin areas, such as digital advertising and marketplace. Our objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales.\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts)\nPercentage change from comparable period\nas a percentage of net sales\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales\nGross profit defined as net sales less cost of sales.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\") increased 40 and 27 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment, due to managing prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps, as well as growth in higher margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower margin merchandise categories. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2024 benefited from lapping higher markdowns incurred in the prior year.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 36 and decreased 60 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to higher variable pay as a result of exceeding planned performance, increased marketing and higher depreciation expenses. The decrease for fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lapping charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment in the prior year.\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales increased 15 and 83 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, due to the factors described above, as well as from strong growth in membership income globally.\nAs we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nReturn on Assets and Return on Investment\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\") and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess our return on capital. ROA is the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") while ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in ROA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. ROA is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during the period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.\nROA was 7.9% and 6.6% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to an increase in consolidated net income during the trailing 12 month period, as a result of higher operating income and changes in the fair value of our equity and other investments.\n\n1.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which was primarily driven by club-fulfilled curbside pickup and delivery.\nMembership and other income increased 13.3% and 7.5% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2025 and 2024, the increases were primarily due to growth in membership base and Plus penetration. Fiscal 2025 and 2024 were also positively impacted by the expiration of a promotional offering offsetting membership fee increases during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nGross profit rate increased 37 and 55 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2025, the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies related to merchandise flow and increased margins in fuel, partially offset by higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. For fiscal\n, the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to the lapping of elevated markdowns in the prior year. Additionally, fiscal 2025 and 2024 gross profit rates were partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 44 and 46 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2025 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to increased compensation related expenses, including associate wage investments and higher variable pay as a result of exceeding our planned performance, as well as elevated technology spend. Fiscal 2024 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to lower fuel sales and elevated technology spend.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.2 billion for both fiscal\n2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $36.4 billion, $35.7 billion and $28.8 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2025, when compared to the previous fiscal year, is primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating income and lapping the payment of accrued opioid legal charges in the prior year, partially offset by increased inventory purchases. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2024, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to higher cash provided by operating income, as well as timing of certain payments and strategic inventory management as part of working capital initiatives, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges.\nCash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit\nCash and cash equivalents were $9.0 billion and $9.9 billion as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $17.1 billion and $15.5 billion as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in our working capital deficit is primarily driven by an increase in short-term borrowings for general corporate purposes and accounts payable due to timing of payments, partially offset by increased inventories and receivables related to higher sales growth. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.\nWe use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Under current law, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. We do not expect current local laws, or other existing limitations on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of operations.\nAs of January 31, 2025 and 2024, cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\n\nITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\"), January 31, 2024 (\"fiscal 2024\") and January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.\nThroughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our ecosystem, such as our advertising net sales. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than 5%. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates have impacted and may continue to impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment.\nWe have taken certain strategic actions across our segments, including an increased emphasis on investments in automation and supply chain as well as diversifying our earnings streams through category and business mix. In December 2024, the Walmart U.S. segment comp",
