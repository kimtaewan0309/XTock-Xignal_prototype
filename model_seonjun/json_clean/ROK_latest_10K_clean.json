We exclude purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, and impairment, corporate and other, non-operating pension and postretirement benefit (cost) credit, net legacy asbestos and environmental charges, change in fair value of investments, restructuring charges aligned with enterprise-wide strategic initiatives, and interest expense, net because we do not consider these items to be directly related to the operating performance of our segments. We believe total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our operating segments. Our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from measures used by other companies.\nLegacy asbestos and environmental charges were previously included in Corporate and other. All periods have been recast to conform with current year presentation.\nAdjusted EPS is a non-GAAP earnings measure. See\nAdjusted Income, Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation\nfor more information on this non-GAAP measure.\n2025 Compared to 2024\nReported and organic sales in fiscal 2025 increased 1 percent compared to 2024, as currency had no material effect. Pricing increased total company sales by approximately 3 percentage points year over year, realized in the Intelligent Devices and Software & Control segments. Volume decreased total company sales by approximately 2 percentage points year over year driven by the Intelligent Devices segment.\nThe table below presents our sales for the year ended September 30, 2025, attributed to the geographic regions based upon country of destination, and the percentage change from the same period in 2024 (in millions, except percentages).\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\nOrganic sales and organic sales growth exclude the effect of acquisitions, changes in currency exchange rates, and divestitures. See\nSupplemental Sales Information\nfor information on these non-GAAP measures.\nCorporate and other expenses were $125 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $114 million in fiscal 2024. Legacy asbestos and environmental charges were previously included in Corporate and other. All periods have been recast to conform with current year presentation.\nPurchase Accounting Depreciation and Amortization, and Impairment\nPurchase accounting depreciation and amortization, and impairment expense was $365 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $144 million in fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily due to a $224 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Sensia joint venture, or $110 million including the impact of non-controlling interest and tax effects.\nRestructuring Charges\nDuring 2025, we reversed $5 million of restructuring accruals primarily due to attrition without payment of severance. Restructuring charges were $97 million in fiscal 2024, which relate to actions in conjunction with an enterprise-wide comprehensive program to optimize cost structure and expand margins. See Note 18 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our restructuring charges.\nLegacy Asbestos and Environmental Charges\nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, we elected to change our method of accounting for net legacy asbestos-related defense costs from expensing as incurred to accruing for all future defense costs for both known and unknown claims, similar to how we account for indemnity costs. We recorded pre-tax expense in Other (expense) income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations of $136 million in the fourth quarter of 2025 ($103 million after tax or $0.91 per share), which includes charges for a change in accounting method of $91 million and indemnity accrual increase of $45 million. See Notes 1 and 17 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Amounts were previously recorded in Corporate and other. All periods have been recast to conform with current year presentation.\nIncome before Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes decreased to $917 million in 2025 from $1,100 million in 2024. The decrease was primarily due to higher compensation, the non-cash impairment charge related to the Sensia joint venture, and an accounting change and accrual increase for legacy asbestos liabilities, partially offset by productivity, price realization, and prior year restructuring charges. Total segment operating earnings increased to $1,703 million from $1,595 million in 2024, primarily due to productivity, higher sales driven by price realization, and favorable mix, partially offset by higher compensation and unfavorable net currency.\nThe effective tax rate in 2025 was 18.3 percent compared to 13.8 percent in 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate is related to valuation allowances and tax effects from the non-cash impairment charge for the Sensia joint venture and higher discrete tax benefits in 2024 as compared to 2025. The Adjusted Effective Tax Rate in 2025 was 17.1 percent compared to 15.3 percent in 2024. The increase in the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate was primarily due to higher discrete tax benefits in 2024 as compared to 2025.\nSee Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and additional information on tax events in 2025 and 2024 affecting each year’s respective tax rates.\nIn October 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and G20 Finance Ministers reached an agreement, known as Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two, that, among other things, ensures that income earned in each jurisdiction that qualifying multinational enterprises operate in is subject to a minimum corporate income tax rate of at least 15 percent. Discussions related to the formal implementation and enactment of this agreement, including within the tax law of each member jurisdiction including the United States, are ongoing. Certain countries have enacted the Pillar Two framework, including Singapore, which is expected to result in the greatest impact to the Company. Enactment of this regulation in its current form would generally apply to the Company beginning in fiscal year 2026, resulting in an approximate increase in our effective tax rate of 3 percent as well as in the amount of global corporate income tax paid.\nIn addition to BEPS Pillar Two, other items could also affect our effective tax rate, many of which are outside of our control,\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\nchanges in the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\nchanging tax laws, regulations, rates and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate;\nchanges to the financial accounting rules for income taxes;\nthe tax effects of acquisitions; and\nthe resolution and timing of issues arising from tax audits.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted in the U.S. The OBBBA includes significant tax related provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act), modifications to the international tax framework, and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The OBBBA has multiple effective dates with the earliest provisions taking effect in fiscal 2025 and others beginning in fiscal 2026 and beyond. ASC 740, “Income Taxes”, requires the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. We have reflected the impact in our deferred balances for the year ended September 30, 2025, and will monitor future effects as new guidance emerges. Based on our evaluation of the guidance available to date we believe the provisions will have an overall neutral impact.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $120 million in 2025 compared to $5 million in 2024. The increase was driven by $107 million of the accounting charge for goodwill and intangibles impairment and related tax effects including tax asset valuation allowances that is attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nDiluted EPS and Adjusted EPS\nFiscal 2025 Net income attributable to Rockwell Automation was $869 million or $7.67 per share, compared to $953 million or $8.28 per share in fiscal 2024. The decreases in Net income attributable to Rockwell Automation and diluted EPS were primarily due to lower pre-tax margin and a higher effective tax rate. Pre-tax margin was 11.0% in 2025 compared to 13.3% in 2024. The decrease was primarily due to higher compensation, the non-cash impairment charge related to the Sensia joint venture, and an accounting change and accrual increase for legacy asbestos liabilities, partially offset by productivity, price realization, and prior year restructuring charges. Adjusted EPS was $10.53 in fiscal 2025, up 7 percent compared to $9.85 in fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher segment operating margin. Total segment operating margin was 20.4% in 2025 compared to 19.3% in 2024. The increase in total segment operating margin was primarily due to productivity, higher sales driven by price realization, and favorable mix, partially offset by higher compensation and unfavorable net currency.\nIntelligent Devices reported and organic sales decreased 1 percent in 2025 compared to 2024. All regions experienced reported sales decreases. All regions except Latin America experienced organic sales decreases.\nSegment Operating Margin\nIntelligent Devices segment operating earnings decreased 3 percent year over year. Segment operating margin decreased to 18.0 percent in 2025 from 18.4 percent in 2024, primarily due to higher compensation, lower sales volume, and a prior year earnout accrual adjustment, partially offset by productivity and price realization.\nSoftware & Control reported and organic sales increased 9 percent in 2025 compared to 2024. All regions except North America experienced reported and organic sales decreases.\nSegment Operating Margin\nSoftware & Control segment operating earnings increased 34 percent year over year. Segment operating margin increased to 29.7 percent in 2025 from 24.2 percent in 2024, primarily due to productivity, higher sales volume, and the positive impact of price realization, partially offset by higher compensation.\nLifecycle Services reported and organic sales decreased 3 percent in 2025 compared to 2024. All regions except Europe, Middle East, and Africa experienced reported sales decreases. All regions experienced organic sales decreases.\nSegment Operating Margin\nLifecycle Services segment operating earnings decreased 13 percent year over year. Segment operating margin decreased to 14.5 percent in 2025 from 16.1 percent in 2024, primarily due to higher compensation, partially offset by strong project execution and productivity.\n2024 Compared to 2023\nFor a discussion of the Company’s fiscal 2024 results compared to fiscal 2023, see Item 7.\nMD&A\nSupplemental Segment Information\nPurchase accounting depreciation and amortization, and impairment, non-operating pension and postretirement benefit (credit) cost, and restructuring charges are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segment’s operating performance for internal purposes. If we were to allocate these costs, we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows (in millions):\n\nYear Ended September 30, 2024\nYear Ended September 30, 2023\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our financial statements as they could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. These estimates are based on our best judgment about current and future conditions, but actual results could differ from those estimates. Refer to Note 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies.\nGoodwill and Intangibles Valuation - Sensia Reporting Unit\nWe monitor adverse events, conditions or changes in circumstances that would indicate impairment of intangible assets that are subject to amortization. When such events, conditions or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of the assets by comparing the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the intangible assets to their carrying amount. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets, is recorded.\nAs a result of the historical financial performance of the Sensia joint venture not achieving expectations, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, a strategic review by the partners resulted in a decision to pursue an orderly dissolution. This decision to dissolve resulted in downward revisions to growth and profitability projections. The decision by the joint partners to pursue dissolution of the joint venture is a triggering event for impairment testing. For the Sensia reporting unit identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization within the Lifecycle Services operating segment, we believed these changes that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2025 would indicate a potential impairment. The estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit were less than the carrying value; therefore, we determined the fair value for Sensia identifiable intangible assets as of September 30, 2025. We engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to assist with the fair value determination of the identifiable intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, using a multi-period excess earnings model. We compared the fair value of $58 million to the carrying value, which resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $63 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Subsequent to the impairment, our consolidated intangible asset balance as of September 30, 2025, is $864 million, including $58 million of identifiable intangible assets within the Sensia reporting unit.\nFollowing the intangible asset impairment analysis, we estimated the fair value of the Sensia reporting unit using an income approach derived from discounted cash flows. As of September 30, 2025, the carrying value of the Sensia reporting unit, after consideration of the fourth quarter intangible asset impairment, was determined to be in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value, resulting in a $161 million pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Subsequent to the impairment, our consolidated goodwill balance as of September 30, 2025, is $3,839 million and there is no remaining goodwill within the Sensia reporting unit.\nCritical assumptions used in this approach included estimated future revenue growth rates and Earnings Befo",
