MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor more than two centuries, we have brewed beverages that unite people to celebrate all life’s moments. From our core power brands\nto our above premium brands including\nBlue Moon Belgian White\nLeinenkugel’s Summer Shandy\n, to our economy and value brands like\n, we produce many beloved and iconic beers. While our Company's history is rooted in beer, we offer a modern portfolio that expands beyond the beer aisle as well, including flavored beverages like\nwhiskey and non-alcoholic beverages. We also have partner brands, such as\namong others, through license, distribution, partnership and joint venture agreements. As a business, our ambition is to be the first choice for our people, our consumers and our customers, and our success depends on our ability to make our products available to meet a wide range of consumer segments and occasions.\nUnless otherwise noted in this report, any description of \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\" includes Molson Coors Beverage Company (\"MCBC\" or the \"Company\"), principally a holding company, and its operating and non-operating subsidiaries included within its reporting segments. Our reporting segments include Americas and EMEA&APAC. Our Americas segment operates in the U.S., Canada and various countries in Latin America and our EMEA&APAC segment operates in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Montenegro, the Republic of Ireland, Romania, Serbia, the U.K., various other European countries and certain countries within the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.\nUnless otherwise indicated, information in this report is presented in USD and comparisons are to comparable prior year periods. Our primary operating currencies, other than the USD, include the CAD, the GBP and our Central European operating currencies, such as the EUR, CZK, RON and RSD.\nGlobal Market Conditions and Competitive Trends\nOur industry is experiencing and, we expect will continue to experience, increased consumer and economic uncertainty due to volatility in the global macroeconomic environment including global trade policies and other geopolitical events with potential resulting impacts on economic growth, consumer confidence, inflation and currencies. In addition, the associated impacts of the macroeconomic environment on the beer industry in the U.S. have resulted in heightened competitive activity and associated reduction in market share of our products in certain segments. The magnitude of the resulting impacts on our business are dependent on the evolution of the global macroeconomic environment and the competitive landscape, including whether share losses are sustained. The economic and competitive pressures, including the impact of tariffs, on our Company and our consumers' consumption behavior and preferences have and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations during this volatile period. For example, tariff announcements in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2025 have indirectly caused the price of the premium on aluminum in the U.S., known as the Midwest Premium, to spike which has had a negative impact and is expected to continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations. While our hedging program can help mitigate some of the volatility, the opaque pricing and limited liquidity of the Midwest Premium can make hedging this exposure costly. Therefore, the Midwest Premium is one of the commodities for which we currently have the least amount of hedged coverage. In addition to impacting the prices of raw materials, a constant or periodic change in the Midwest Premium may decrease our profit margins or impact our end consumers as we may pass on the increased costs to our consumers. We plan to continue to evaluate and implement strategies which are designed to help mitigate the impact on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition while continuing to support our long-term strategic growth and capital allocation priorities.\nChief Executive Officer Succession\nOn April 12, 2025, Gavin D.K. Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of the Company and a member of the Board informed the Company and the Board that he intends to retire from the Company and as a member of the Board, in each case, by December 31, 2025.\nOn September 19, 2025, the Board appointed Rahul Goyal as the Company’s President and CEO and member of the Board effective, in each case, as of October 1, 2025, following the retirement of Gavin D.K. Hattersley from those same positions immediately prior to such appointments. Gavin D.K. Hattersley will remain employed by the Company in an advisory role to assist in the transition until December 31, 2025, or an earlier date as determined by Gavin D.K. Hattersley or the Company.\nAmericas Restructuring Plan\nOn October 20, 2025, the Company announced an Americas restructuring plan designed to create a leaner, more agile Americas segment while advancing its ability to reinvest in the business and position the Company for future growth. The restructuring plan involves the planned elimination of approximately 400 salaried positions across the Americas segment by the end of December 2025. In connection with the Americas restructuring plan, the Company currently expects to incur certain restructuring charges, in the range of $35 million to $50 million, which are expected to be future cash expenditures to be made over the next 12 months. Substantially all of the charges are expected to be related to severance payments and post-employment benefits to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nItems Affecting the Consolidated Results of Operations\nPurchases of Annuity Contracts\nOn September 26, 2024, we purchased annuity contracts for two of our Canadian pension plans. As a result, on September 30, 2024, we remeasured both pension plans and recorded a total settlement loss of $34.0 million to other pension and postretirement benefit (costs), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations during the third quarter of 2024. See\nPart I. — Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"\nfor further information.\nCobra Beer Partnership, Ltd. Buyout\nDuring March 2024, our partner in CBPL exercised a put option under our partnership agreement which required us to acquire the remaining 49.9% ownership interest. We adjusted our NCI by $34.5 million to our best estimate of the redemption value that existed at the time of the put option exercise by increasing our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and decreasing our net income attributable to MCBC. In addition, we received the final determination of the redemption value in October 2024 and as the transaction was considered mandatorily redeemable, we recorded an adjustment of $45.8 million to interest expense in the EMEA&APAC segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nItems Affecting the Americas Segment Results of Operations\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, we recorded a partial goodwill impairment charge of $3,645.7 million to goodwill impairment in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations related to our Americas reporting unit.

Financial Statements\n, Note 5, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\"\nfor further information.\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, we recorded a full impairment charge of $75.3 million related to our\ndefinite-lived intangible asset within other operating income (expense), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. See\nPart I.—Item 1. Financial Statements\n, Note 5, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\"\nfor further information.\nFevertree Transactions\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, we obtained exclusive rights via a license agreement to produce, market and sell Fever-Tree products in the U.S. In connection with this agreement, we acquired the shares of the Fevertree USA, Inc. entity, with the immaterial acquisition accounted for as a business combination and consideration allocated primarily to working capital balances. The acquisition is aligned with our strategy to expand beyond the beer aisle as Fever-Tree is the world's leading supplier of premium carbonated mixers.\nWind Down or Sale of Certain U.S. Craft Businesses\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we decided to wind down or sell certain of our U.S. craft businesses and related facilities and recorded employee-related and asset abandonment charges, including accelerated depreciation in excess of normal depreciation. We recognized a loss of $41.1 million related to the disposal of the sold businesses. See\nPart I. — Item 1. Financial Statements\nNote 12, \"Other Operating Income (Expense), net\n\" for further information.\nItems Affecting the EMEA&APAC Segment Results of Operations\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, we recorded a partial impairment charge of $198.6 million related to our\nfamily of brands indefinite-lived intangible asset within other operating income (expense), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.
