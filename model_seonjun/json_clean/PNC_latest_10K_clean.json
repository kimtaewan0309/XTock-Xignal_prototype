  "item1_clean": "The CFPB also has authority to take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive, and to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service.\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact products and services offered by PNC or PNC Bank. The CFPB has engaged in rulemakings that affect, among other things, credit card late fees, overdraft fees, data collection and reporting requirements for small business lenders such as PNC Bank, and personal financial data rights. In early February 2025, the Acting Director of the CFPB instructed CFPB staff to, among other things, cease supervision and examination activities, pause pending investigation and enforcement actions, and not approve or issue any proposed or final rules. At this time, it is unclear how long these instructions will stay in force, either fully or partially.\nSecurities and Derivatives Regulation\nPNC, as a public company, is subject to the Exchange Act’s reporting requirements and related regulations and must file certain reports with the SEC on an ongoing basis. Our registered broker-dealers and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to the Exchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, respectively, and related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. These rules, for example, require that broker-dealers and investment advisers act in a customer’s best interest when making investment recommendations to retail customers, which includes managing conflicts of interest, providing required disclosures and exercising a duty of care in making investment recommendations. FINRA is the primary self-regulatory organization for our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Our broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions.\nThe SEC and FINRA have active enforcement functions that oversee broker-dealers and investment advisers and can bring actions that result in fines, restitution, a limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations also can affect our ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital markets. In addition, certain changes in the activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into account a variety of considerations in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, prior enforcement and disciplinary history and supervisory concerns.\nThe CFTC regulates swap dealers, other than security-based swap dealers, which are regulated by the SEC. PNC Bank is registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC. Because of the limited volume of our security-based swap dealing activities, PNC Bank has not registered (and currently does not intend, and is not required, to register) with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer.\nPNC Bank’s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses are subject to the regulations and requirements imposed on CFTC-registered swap dealers, and the CFTC (and for certain delegated responsibilities, the National Futures Association) has a meaningful supervisory role with respect to PNC Bank’s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. The CFTC’s regulations are intended to (i) address systemic risk issues, (ii) bring greater transparency to the derivatives and foreign exchange markets, (iii) provide enhanced disclosures and protections to customers and (iv) promote market integrity. Among other things, these regulations (i) require that, absent certain specified exemptions, most standardized swaps be centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house and be traded on a centralized exchange or swap execution facility; (ii) subject PNC Bank to comprehensive recordkeeping, regulatory reporting and real-time public reporting requirements; (iii) subject PNC Bank to various business conduct requirements, including the provision of daily marks to counterparties and disclosing to counterparties (pre-execution) the material risks, material incentives and any conflicts of interest associated with their swap; and (iv) impose special duties on PNC Bank when transacting a swap with a “special entity” (\n, governmental agency (federal, state or local) or political subdivision thereof, pension plan or endowment). Because PNC Bank is a prudentially regulated swap dealer, PNC Bank is subject to the OCC’s capital requirements and margin requirements on certain swaps that are not centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house.\nThe regulations and requirements applicable to PNC Bank, as a provisionally registered CFTC swap dealer, impose compliance burdens on PNC Bank and introduce additional legal risks (including as a result of applicable anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action). In addition, failure to comply with the “pay-to-play” regulations that govern our swap and municipal securities businesses could result in limitations on PNC Bank’s ability to conduct swap and municipal securities business with state or local governments and their authorities.\nRegulations of Other Agencies\nIn addition to regulations issued by the federal banking, securities and derivatives regulators, we also are subject to regulations issued by other federal agencies with respect to certain financial products and services we offer. For example, certain of our fiduciary, brokerage and investment management activities are subject to regulations issued by the Department of Labor under ERISA and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n\nITEM 1 – BUSINESS\nHeadquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we are one of the largest diversified financial institutions in the U.S. We have businesses engaged in retail banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many of our products and services nationally. Our retail branch network is located coast-to-coast. We also have strategic international offices in four countries outside the U.S. At December 31, 2024, our consolidated total assets, total deposits and total shareholders’ equity were $560.0 billion, $426.7 billion and $54.4 billion, respectively.\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 with the consolidation of Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation. Since 1983, we have diversified our geographical presence, business mix and product capabilities through organic growth, strategic bank and non-bank acquisitions and equity investments, and the formation of various non-banking subsidiaries. We offer a broad range of deposit, credit and fee-based products and services to serve our customers. See Note 22 Segment Reporting for additional details regarding our products and services.\nSignature Bank Portfolio Acquisition\nOn October 2, 2023, PNC acquired a portfolio of capital commitments facilities from Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. through an agreement with the FDIC as receiver of the former Signature Bank, New York. The acquired portfolio represented approximately $16.0 billion in total commitments, including approximately $9.0 billion of funded loans, at the time of acquisition.\nOur corporate legal structure at December 31, 2024 consisted of one domestic subsidiary bank, including its subsidiaries, and 53 active non-bank subsidiaries, in addition to various affordable housing investments and historic rehabilitation investments. Our bank subsidiary is PNC Bank, a national bank chartered in Wilmington, Delaware. For additional information on certain of our subsidiaries, see Exhibit 21 to this Report.\nSupervision and Regulation\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a BHC registered under the BHC Act and a financial holding company under the GLB Act. PNC primarily conducts its business through its domestic bank subsidiary, PNC Bank, a national banking association chartered and located in Wilmington, Delaware.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations, some of which are highlighted below. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding our regulatory matters. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our permissible activities and investments, impose conditions and requirements on the products and services we offer and the manner in which they are offered and sold, and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, investment management and other customers, among other things. They also restrict our ability to repurchase stock or pay dividends, or to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary, and impose capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. The consequences of noncompliance with these, or other applicable laws or regulations, can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions. See the additional information included\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n\nas Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report discussing the impact of the regulatory environment on us and the financial services industry.\nIn addition, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and examination by many regulatory bodies, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory policies of the agency, but also capital levels, asset quality, risk management effectiveness, the ability and performance of management and the Board of Directors, the effectiveness of internal controls and internal audit function, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.\nThe results of examination activity by any of our federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant limitations on our activities and growth. These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity and take enforcement action, including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements, against a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines, among other things, that the operations of the regulated entity or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable law or regulations, are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner, or represent an unfair or deceptive act or practice. This supervisory framework, including the examination reports and supervisory ratings (which are not publicly available) of the agencies, could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations.\nThe CFPB is responsible for examining us for compliance with most federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws relating to fair lending and prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products or services, and for enforcing such laws with respect to PNC Bank and its affiliates. The results of the CFPB’s examinations (which are not publicly available) also can result in restrictions or limitations on the operations of a regulated entity as well as enforcement actions against a regulated entity, including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements.\nWe also are subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of our status as a public company and by the SEC and the CFTC due to the nature of some of our businesses. Our businesses with operations outside the U.S. also are subject to regulation by appropriate authorities in the foreign jurisdictions in which they do business.\nAs a regulated financial services firm, our relationships and good standing with regulators are of fundamental importance to the operation and growth of our businesses.

  "item7_clean": "Income Statement Highlights\nNet income for 2024 was $6.0 billion or $13.74 per diluted common share, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 5%, compared to net income of $5.6 billion, or $12.79 per diluted common share, for 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower noninterest expense and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income.\nTotal revenue was stable at $21.6 billion.\nNet interest income decreased $0.4 billion, or 3%, to $13.5 billion as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields and balances was more than offset by increased funding costs.\nNet interest margin decreased to 2.66% for 2024 compared to 2.76% for 2023.\nNoninterest income increased $0.5 billion, or 6%, to $8.1 billion primarily driven by higher capital markets and advisory fees.\nProvision for credit losses was $789 million in 2024 reflecting the impact of net charge-offs, primarily in our commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and credit card loan classes, and a net decline in the ACL due to improved macroeconomic factors and portfolio activity. Provision for credit losses was $742 million in 2023.\nNoninterest expense decreased $488 million, or 3%, to $13.5 billion compared to 2023 reflecting lower costs related to the FDIC’s special assessment and lower personnel expense, partially offset by a PNC Foundation contribution expense of $120 million in the second quarter of 2024 and impairments of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily related to technology investments. Costs related to the FDIC special assessment were $112 million in 2024 compared to $515 million in 2023. Noninterest expense in 2023 also included $150 million of workforce reduction charges.\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Item 7.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nOur balance sheet was well positioned at December 31, 2024. In comparison to December 31, 2023:\nTotal assets were stable and included higher securities balances, partially offset by lower loans outstanding and lower balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank.\nTotal loans decreased $5.0 billion, or 2%, to $316.5 billion.\nTotal commercial loans decreased $3.4 billion, or 2%, to $216.2 billion, due to lower utilization of loan commitments and commercial real estate paydowns.\nTotal consumer loans decreased $1.6 billion, or 2%, to $100.3 billion, as growth in automobile loans was more than offset by declines in the remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced originations.\nInvestment securities increased $7.2 billion, or 5%, to $139.7 billion, due to increased purchase activity, primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities.\nInterest earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, decreased $4.5 billion, or 10%, to $39.3 billion, primarily due to lower borrowed funds and higher securities balances, partially offset by higher deposits and lower loan balances.\nTotal deposits increased $5.3 billion, or 1%, to $426.7 billion, reflecting higher interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Interest-bearing deposits increased due to higher commercial balances, partially offset by lower consumer balances. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased due to a decline in both commercial and consumer balances.\nBorrowed funds of $61.7 billion decreased $11.1 billion, or 15%, due to lower FHLB advances, partially offset by parent company senior debt issuances.\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7.\nCredit Quality Highlights\n2024 reflected strong credit quality performance.\nAt December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023:\nOverall loan delinquencies of $1.4 billion were stable.\nThe ACL related to loans, which consists of the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments, totaled $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The reserve change was driven by improved macroeconomic factors as well as portfolio activity. ACL to total loans was 1.64% and 1.70% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNonperforming assets of $2.4 billion increased $141 million, or 6%, primarily due to higher commercial real estate nonperforming loans.\nNet charge-offs of $1.0 billion or 0.33% of average loans in 2024 increased $331 million compared to net charge-offs of $710 million or 0.22% of average loans for 2023, reflecting higher commercial and consumer net loan charge-offs.\nFor additional detail, see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n\nResidential Mortgage Information\nResidential mortgage servicing statistics (in billions, except as noted) (c)\nServiced portfolio balance (d)\nServicing income: (in millions)\nServicing fees, net (e)\nMortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge\nResidential mortgage loan statistics\nLoan origination volume (in billions)\nLoan sale margin percentage\nCredit-related statistics\nNonperforming assets (d)\nNet charge-offs - loans and leases\nBrokerage account client assets (in billions) (d) (g)\nRepresents expense allocations for corporate overhead services used by each business segment; primarily comprised of technology, human resources and occupancy-related allocations.\nOther is primarily comprised of other direct expenses including outside services and equipment expense.

Average consumer loans decreased driven by lower residential real estate, as a result of paydowns outpacing new volume, as well as continued declines in education loans from runoff in the government guaranteed portfolio. Average commercial loans increased due to growth in loan commitments utilization, primarily within the automobile dealer segment.\nOur focus on growing primary customer relationships is at the core of our deposit strategy in Retail, which is based on attracting and retaining stable, low-cost deposits as a key funding source for PNC. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing, focused on\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n\nInterest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. For more information, see the Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (non-GAAP) of this Item 7.\nChanges in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis section of this Item 7 for additional information.\nNet interest income decreased $0.4 billion, or 3%, and net interest margin decreased 10 basis points in 2024 compared with 2023 as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields and balances were more than offset by increased funding costs.\nAverage investment securities were stable as net purchase activity of available-for-sale securities was offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities of held-to-maturity securities. Average investment securities represented 27% of average interest-earning assets in 2024 compared to 28% in 2023.\nAverage loans decreased $3.7 billion, or 1%, primarily due to lower average utilization of commercial loan commitments. Average loans represented 62% of average interest-earning assets in 2024 compared to 64% in 2023.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n\n(Continued from previous page)\nYear ended December 31\nConsolidated revenue from: (c)\nTreasury Management (d)\nCommercial mortgage banking activities:\nCommercial mortgage loans held for sale (e)\nCommercial mortgage loan servicing income (f)\nCommercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge\nCommercial mortgage servicing statistics\nServiced portfolio balance (in billions) (g) (h)\nAverage Loans by C&IB business\nCredit-related statistics\nNonperforming assets (g)\nNet charge-offs - loans and leases\nRepresents expense allocations for corporate overhead services used by each business segment; primarily comprised of technology, human resources and occupancy-related allocations.\nOther is primarily comprised of other direct expenses including outside services and equipment expense.\nSee the additional revenue discussion regarding treasury management and commercial mortgage banking activities in the Product Revenue section of this Corporate & Institutional Banking section.\nAmounts are reported in net interest income and noninterest income.\nRepresents commercial mortgage banking income for valuations on commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments, derivative valuations, origination fees, gains on sale of loans held for sale and net interest income on loans held for sale.\nRepresents net interest income and noninterest income from loan servicing, net of reduction in commercial mortgage servicing rights due to time and payoffs. Commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge is shown separately.\nRepresents balances related to capitalized servicing.\nCorporate & Institutional Banking earnings increased $680 million in 2024 compared with 2023 driven by higher revenue, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and increased noninterest expense.\nNet interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans and lower average loan balances.\nNoninterest income increased in the comparison primarily due to higher capital markets and advisory fees and growth in treasury management product revenue.\nProvision for credit losses reflected the impact of net charge-offs and a net decline in the ACL due to improved macroeconomic factors and portfolio activity.\nNoninterest expense increased in the comparison primarily due to increased business activity, partially offset by a continued focus on expense management.\nAverage loans decreased compared with 2023:\nCorporate Banking provides lending, equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business were stable as lower average utilization of loan commitments was largely offset by the acquisition of capital commitment facilities from Signature Bridge Bank in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nReal Estate provides banking, financing, servicing and technology solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average loans for this business declined largely due to paydowns outpacing new production, partially offset by a higher average utilization of loan commitments.\nBusiness Credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. The loan and lease portfolio is mainly secured by business assets. Average loans for this business were stable, primarily driven by new production, partially offset by a lower average utilization of loan commitments.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n\nOur assets and liabilities are primarily financial in nature and typically have varying maturity dates. Accordingly, future changes in\nprices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. However, during periods of inflation,\nthere may be a subsequent impact affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of consumer and customer purchasing power,\nand fluctuations in the need or demand for our products and services. When significant levels of inflation occur, our business could\npotentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional credit\nlosses resulting from possible increased default rates. While interest rates remained high in 2024, inflation has started to slow, leading to an easing of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. See Item 1A Risk Factors, our Executive Summary and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in this Item 7 for further discussion of inflation and its overall impact to the economy, our borrowers’ ability to repay their obligations and certain costs and expenses to PNC.\nFinancial Derivatives\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.\nFurther information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 14 Fair Value and Note 15 Financial Derivatives.\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.\nOperational Risk Management\nOperational risk is the risk to PNC’s current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct or adverse external events. Operational risk is inherent to the entire organization.\nOperational risk management is embedded in our culture and decision-making processes through a systematic approach whereby operational risks and exposures are: (i) identified and assessed; (ii) managed through the design and implementation of controls; (iii) measured and evaluated agains",
