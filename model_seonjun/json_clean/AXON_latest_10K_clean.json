In 2022, we announced our moonshot goal to cut gun-related deaths between police and the public in the United States in half by 2033.\nAxon is building the public safety operating system of the future by integrating a suite of hardware devices and cloud software solutions that not only revolutionize modern policing but also cater to federal agencies, corrections, justice and enterprise-level security needs. Axon’s suite includes cloud-hosted digital evidence management solutions, productivity and real-time operations software, body cameras, in-car cameras, TASER energy devices, drone and robotic security, and training solutions.\nOur hardware and software solutions advance our mission to (i) make the bullet obsolete, (ii) reduce social conflict, and (iii) enable a fair and effective justice system. Our products solve some of society's most challenging problems and our mission attracts top talent. We aim to invent and deliver public safety products that progressively make the right things easier and the wrong things harder every day.\nOur research & development (“R&D”) investments support continuous innovation on behalf of our customers. Our financial strategy is to build highly recurring, highly profitable businesses and to drive growth through this purposeful product innovation.\nAxon’s operations comprise two reportable segments:\nSoftware and Sensors: We develop, manufacture and sell fully integrated hardware and cloud-based software solutions that enable law enforcement to capture, securely store, manage, share and analyze video and other digital evidence. Our software offerings also support productivity and real-time operations. The Software and Sensors segment includes the sale of sensors, including body cameras, in-car cameras, other hardware sensors, warranties on sensors, and other products, as well as recurring cloud-hosted software revenue, related non-recurring professional services revenue, and revenue from certain software, including on-premise licenses.\nTASER: Axon is the market leader in the development, manufacture and sale of conducted energy devices (\"CEDs\"), which we sell under our brand name, TASER. The TASER segment includes the manufacture and sale of CEDs, batteries, accessories and extended warranties, digital subscription training content, virtual reality (\"VR\") training content, TASER Evidence.com license revenue, and other professional services tied to TASER and VR deployments.\nAxon employees are distributed across multiple geographies and report to work via a remote-hybrid model, which leverages both in-person collaboration environments as well as cloud-based software tools that enable remote productivity. Our headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona and our hubs in Seattle, Washington; San Francisco, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Atlanta, Georgia; and Sterling, Virginia house the majority of our in-person employees located in the United States, including members of our executive management team, and sales, marketing, certain engineering, manufacturing, finance and other administrative support functions. We also have subsidiaries and/or offices located in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Vietnam.\nKey Product Category Revenue Drivers: What We Offer\nAxon products are generally cloud-connected, designed to drive better outcomes and customer experiences, and sold via mutually reinforcing integrated subscription plans. Our key revenue drivers belong to three broad product categories:\nAxon is building a suite of cloud-based, Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solutions that integrate with our sensors and TASER devices to benefit customers and drive annual recurring revenue, which totaled\nas of December 31, 2024. We have many SaaS solutions, which can best be trisected into three categories: digital evidence management, productivity and real-time operations solutions. Axon Evidence is the world’s largest cloud-hosted public safety data repository of public safety video data and other types of digital evidence. Our productivity suite, which includes Axon Records and artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), is designed to save officers time spent writing reports and doing paperwork. Our real-time operations capabilities, which include Axon Respond, integrates location data, signal alerts and video feeds to provide a complete picture of evolving situations.\nAxon devices address many needs, including transparency, real-time situational awareness, and accurate capture and integration of evidence with software workflows. Product categories within sensors include Axon Body cameras, Axon Fleet in-car systems, drones and robotics, and other devices that work with our software. Our software solutions also support an open ecosystem of connected devices produced by other vendors.\nTASER:\nWe develop smart devices, tools and services that support public safety officers in de-escalating situations, avoiding or minimizing use of force and aiding consumer personal protection. These tools include TASER devices, VR training services and consumer devices. Research has shown that TASER devices are the most effective less-than-lethal force option, with the lowest likelihood of injury to officers and assailants. Since our inception in 1993, TASER devices have been adopted by a majority of U.S. state and local law enforcement and are used daily to help keep communities safe. Global adoption of TASER devices remains early and we are expanding into new geographies. Axon VR solutions make public safety training more accessible, relevant and affordable — with the goal of using new immersive VR technologies to better prepare officers for real-life situations in the field.\nSales and Distribution: Who We Sell To and Where We Deliver\nWe think of our core customers as falling into roughly four categories of funding sources: U.S. state and local governments, the U.S. federal government, international government customers and commercial enterprises. Additionally, the types of customers who find value in our product offerings are expanding beyond law enforcement to include customers such as attorneys, corrections, fire and emergency medical services personnel, commercial enterprise security, frontline enterprise workers, and the U.S. military.\nAxon’s sales force and strong customer relationships represent key strategic advantages. The majority of our revenues are generated via direct sales, including our online store, although we do leverage distribution partners and third-party resellers.\nNo customer represented more than 10% of total net sales\nfor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. As we diversify into new markets, we have been investing in sales personnel and strategic headcount additions to support growth in these markets.\nGovernmental agencies generally have the ability to terminate our contracts, in whole or in part, for reasons including non-appropriation of funds. We continue to monitor developments in federal government funding.\nManufacturing and Supply Chain\nWe perform light manufacturing, final assembly and final test operations at our facilities in Scottsdale, Arizona and own substantially all of the equipment required to develop, prototype, manufacture and assemble our finished products. We have continued to maintain both our ISO 9001 and our ISO 9001:2015 certifications.\nWe continue to take steps to diversify our supply chain and global manufacturing footprint, which positions us well to manage supply chain disruptions. Material availability has mostly stabilized from prior supply chain challenges while general levels of risk continue to exist in all businesses that manufacture products. Supplier decommitments remain a top\n\nCalculated as monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. Annual recurring revenue is a forward-looking performance indicator that management believes provides more visibility into the growth of our revenue generated by our highest margin, recurring services. Annual recurring revenue should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue because it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace GAAP revenue or deferred revenue, as they can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. Annual recurring revenue is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue or deferred revenue.\narea of risk. However, we have put programs in place to mitigate this risk. We proactively manage our supply chain down to third tier suppliers to mitigate and overcome material shortages. These actions align to our strategic model to help meet strong product demand while also preparing us to stagger factory work schedules as needed, which enables us to meet compressed build schedules over short periods of time. We continue to adjust strategic inventory levels in both raw materials and finished goods based on areas of risk to mitigate potential supply disruptions.\nIn light of our broad domestic and international supplier base, we are continuously monitoring our supply chain to manage through potential impacts, identifying alternate shipping and logistic sources, and working with foreign regulators to ensure that our suppliers can provide high quality parts. Despite past supply chain disruptions relating to material shortages and port constraints, we remain focused on actively managing our supply chain by strengthening strategic relationships, securing secondary and alternate sourcing, adjusting build plans, maintaining strategic inventory and utilizing flexible logistics to support growing demand while minimizing customer disruptions.\nIntellectual Property\nWe protect our intellectual property with U.S. and foreign patents, U.S. and foreign trademark registrations, and U.S. copyright registrations. Our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations and laws to protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2024, we hold over\n330 U.S. patents, over 150 U.S. registered trademarks, over 270 international patents and over 460 international registered trademarks, a\ns well as numerous pending patent and trademark applications.\nWe continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance to our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions, our strategic technology or product directions in different countries, and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions. We have the exclusive rights to many Internet domain names, primarily including “Axon.com,” “Evidence.com” and “TASER.com.” We also vigorously protect our intellectual property, including our patents and trademarks against third-party infringement.\nWe also execute non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants and key suppliers to help ensure the confidentiality of our trade secrets.\nSensors — Connected Cameras and Digital Evidence Management Software:\nThe body camera and in-car video/automatic license plate readers industry is highly competitive.

Axon’s suite includes cloud-hosted digital evidence management solutions, productivity and real-time operations software, body cameras, in-car cameras, TASER energy devices, robotic security and training solutions. Axon’s growing global customer base includes first responders across international, federal, state, and local law enforcement, fire, corrections, and emergency medical services, as well as the justice sector, commercial enterprises, and consumers.\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $2.1 billion, an increase of $521.8 million, or 33.4%, from the comparable period in the prior year. We had income from operations of $58.5 million, compared to $156.9 million for the same period in the prior year. Gross margin dollars increased $285.9 million but decreased as a percentage of revenue to 59.6% from 61.2% compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles. Excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense and intangibles amortization in costs of goods sold, adjusted gross margin increased to 63.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 61.8% for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increased mix of high-margin Axon Cloud & Services revenue and investments in TASER automation and cost-reduction initiatives. Operating expenses increased $384.2 million, reflecting an increase in salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expenses, as well as an increase in professional and consulting expenses related to transaction costs. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded net income of $377.0 million which included net realized and unrealized gains on fair value adjustments of strategic investments of $162.9 million, a net unrealized gain on marketable securities of $120.3 million, and interest income, net of $36.6 million. Net income of $175.8 million for the comparable period in the prior year reflected net unrealized losses of $80.5 million related to impairment and observable price changes for our existing investments and related warrants, interest income, net of $42.1 million, and a net unrealized gain of $38.7 million on marketable securities.\nAdditionally, in Q1 2025 we approved a plan to realign our business to better reflect our continued growth and expansion of product, software and service offerings. Previously reported within two reportable segments, TASER and Software and Sensors, we will prospectively reorganize our business in a manner that provides increased transparency and distinction between our hardware and software and services components. As a result of the reorganization, effective with the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, our financial results will be reported in two reportable segments, Connected Devices and Software & Services, which our CODM will use to regularly review information, allocate resources and assess performance. Connected Devices will include hardware products, such as CEDs, body cameras, and drones. Software & Services will include products that integrate with our suite of connected devices, such as Axon Evidence, RMS and other cloud services.\nWe are currently assessing the impact of this change on our financial reporting and related segment disclosures. We intend to recast prior period segment information to conform to the new reporting structure, as necessary, to ensure consistency and comparability across reporting periods.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents data from our consolidated statements of operations as well as the percentage relationship to total net sales of items included in our statements of operations (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nNet sales from products\nNet sales from services\nCost of product sales\nCost of service sales\nSelling, general and administrative\nResearch and development\nTotal operating expenses\nIncome from operations\nInterest income, net\nOther income (loss), net\nIncome before provision for income taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by geography (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n\nAxon Evidence and Cloud Services\nAxon Body Cameras and Accessories\nSoftware and Sensors segment\nTASER segment “Other” includes smaller categories, such as VR hardware, weapons training revenue such as revenue associated with our Master Instructor School, and TASER consumer device sales.\nSoftware and Sensors segment “Other” includes revenue from items including Signal Sidearm, Interview Room, Axon Air, partners' contra-revenue and other sensors and equipment.\nNet sales for the TASER segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $205.2 million, or 33.4%, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $119.1 million in TASER devices and an increase of $53.5 million in cartridge revenue. The increase is primarily related to continued adoption of our newest device, TASER 10. The increase in revenue from Axon Evidence and cloud services of $19.2 million was driven by an increase in the number of cloud-connected TASER devices in the field and software revenue tied to our VR solution. An increase in TASER devices in the field drove the $5.8 million increase in extended warranties, as most of those devices are sold with extended warranties. The $7.5 million increase in \"Other\" revenue is primarily driven by increased VR hardware volume.\nNet sales for the Software and Sensors segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $316.7 million, or 33.4%, as compared to the prior year, as we continued to add users and associated devices to our network. The increase in the aggregate number of users and growing adoption of our premium add-on features by existing customers drove the majority of the increase in Axon Evidence and cloud services revenue of $242.3 million. Axon Body cameras and accessories revenue increased $63.8 million due to higher unit sales. Partially offsetting the increase was a $17.0 million decrease in Axon Fleet systems revenue reflecting lower unit volumes on more normalized deployment timelines. An increase in cameras and docks in the field drove the $11.0 million increase in extended warranties, as most of those devices are sold with extended warranties. The $16.5 million increase in “Other” revenue was primarily driven by demand for other product offerings within the Software and Sensors segment.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross margin for the TASER segment decreased to 58.6% from 60.6% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and\nrespectively. The decrease was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense. Excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense, adjusted gross margin for the TASER segment is\n62.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 60.9% for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to investments in automation and cost reduction initiatives.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross margin for the Software and Sensors segment decreased to 60.2% from 61.6% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Within the Software and Sensors segment, hardware gross margin was 37.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 45.8% for the same period in 2023. Excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets, hardware adjusted gross margin decreased to 41.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 46.2% for the same period in 2023 primarily due to product mix and inventory reserve charges associated with legacy products. Service gross margin increased to 73.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 72.6% for the same period in 2023. Excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense and intangibles amortization, service adjusted gross margin increased to 75.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 73.6% for the same period in 2023, due to higher software revenue mix.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nSalaries, benefits and bonus\nStock-based compensation\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales\nSalaries, benefits and bonus expense increased $36.0 million in comparison to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to an increase in headcount and higher wages.\nSales and marketing expense increased $17.1 million in comparison to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to increased commissions of $12.4 million and an increase of $4.7 million related to in-person events.\nStock-based compensation expense increased $132.0 million in comparison to the prior year, which was primarily related to the 2024 Employee XSP and the 2024 CEO Performance Award that were approved by shareholders in the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and increased headcount.\nOther SG&A expenses increased $61.2 million in comparison to the prior year, primarily driven by the following:\nProfessional and consulting expenses increased $21.5 million, primarily driven by transaction costs related to business acquisitions and strategic investments for Fusus and Dedrone;\nTravel expenses increased $9.5 million, as a result of increased in-person meetings and lodging costs;\nOffice and building expenses increased $7.1 million relating to building rent and property taxes;\nSupplies expenses increased $6.7 million primarily due to an increase in computer licenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nSalaries, benefits and bonus\nStock-based compensation\nTotal research and development expenses\nR&D expenses as a percentage of net sales\nSalaries, benefits, and bonus expense increased $54.6 million in comparison to the prior-year comparable period, which was primarily attributable to an increase in headcount and higher wages.\nStock-based compensation expense increased $65.7 million which was primarily related to the 2024 Employee XSP that was approved by shareholders in the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and increased headcount.\nOther R&D expenses increased $17.6 million, primarily related to increased professional and consulting expenses related to the launch of new products of $6.6 million, and increased internal cloud storage and service costs related to software product development of $3.9 million.\nInterest Income, Net\nInterest income, net, was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nTotal interest income, net\nThe decrease in interest income for the year ended\nis primarily related to lowe\nr balances of available-for-sale securities during the year.

The increase in unrealized gain on marketable securities for the year ended December 31, 2024 is driven by fair value changes for our existing marketable securities.\nIn 2023, we recorded a net unrealized impairment loss of $71.9 million for an existing strategic investment and related warrants and an unrealized loss of $8.6 million related to observable price changes for our existing investments and related warrants.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate was 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to (11.9)% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily driven by higher pre-tax income, which reduced the relative impact of favorable tax adjustments. The increase in current year rate is primarily driven by a lesser percentage of allowable stock based compensation adjustment in comparison to pre-tax book income. Additionally, the R&D credit was a lesser percentage of pretax income which was offset by the reversal of nontaxable gain on investments.\nProvision for income taxes were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\nWe recorded net income of $377.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a net income of $175.8 million in 2023. Net income per basic share was\n$4.98 and diluted net income per share was $4.80\nfor 2024, compared to net income per basic share of $2.37 and diluted net income per share of $2.33 for 2023.\nWe utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted gross margin as defined below to enhance understanding of our financial results and related measures. Beginning with our first fiscal quarter of 2024, we have added adjusted gross margin to our non-GAAP financial measures. We have adjusted for expenses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. To improve comparability, prior periods have been conformed to the current period presentation. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our operating performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented below.\nEBITDA (most comparable GAAP measure: Net income) – Earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA (most comparable GAAP measure: Net income) – Earnings before interest expense; investment interest income; income taxes; depreciation; amortization; noncash stock-based compensation expense; fair value adjustments related to strategic investments and marketable securities; transaction and integration costs related to strategic investments and acquisitions including adjustments related to the foreign currency impact of acquired intercompany balances that were unsettled as of the reporting date and plan to be settled in the near term; inventory step-up amortization related to acquisitions; certain litigation costs and recoveries related to (1) antitrust cases we consider to be non-recurring and outside of our core operating results and (2) litigation matters for acquired companies that were unresolved at the date of the acquisition; and other unusual, non-recurring pre-tax items that are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance (listed in the tables below).\nAdjusted gross margin (most comparable GAAP measure: Gross margin) – Gross margin before noncash stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and inventory step-up amortization related to acquisitions.\nAlthough these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, we believe investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing our operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and s",
