Players can access our products and services through traditional single-game purchase or through subscription offerings; and certain of our products and services are available through a “free-to-play” model whereby players download the game for free and engage with services provided on an ongoing basis. For example, we develop products and services within the EA SPORTS FC franchise that allow players to engage through multiple business models, distribution channels and devices, including: (1) our annualized console and PC games and associated experiences, which can be purchased through both digital distribution and retail channels and also are available through subscription services; (2) a mobile free-to-play offering; and (3) a PC free-to-play game available in certain countries. Revenue from our EA SPORTS FC franchise, as well as revenue from our American football franchise, is material to our business and will continue to be so.\nDistribution of Products and Services\n. We primarily distribute our console products and services through partners, such as Sony and Microsoft. Under the terms of publishing agreements our products and services are developed, marketed, published, and distributed with PlayStation\nand Xbox consoles. Our direct sales to Sony and Microsoft represented approximately 39 percent and 17 percent of total net revenue, respectively, in fiscal year 2025.\n\nApplication storefront policies are determined unilaterally by the distributors and are subject to change.\nOur PC products and services can be downloaded directly through the EA app, EA’s digital storefront, as well as through third-party online download stores, such as Steam. We also have agreements with companies, such as Tencent Holdings Limited, Nexon Co., Ltd and Garena Online Private Limited, or their respective affiliates, that allow these companies to publish our mobile and PC free-to-play games in certain countries. Our players access games from the publishers’ online storefronts and are charged for additional content purchased within our game environment. The agreements generally establish the amounts that are retained by the publisher and the amounts passed through to us.\nThe market for interactive entertainment is intensely competitive and changes rapidly as new products, business models and distribution channels are introduced. We also face competition for the right to license certain intellectual property included in our products. In order to remain successful, we are required to anticipate and commit to, sometimes years in advance, the ways in which our products and services will compete in the market. We face significant competition from companies that focus on developing products and services available on consoles, PCs and/or mobile devices. In addition, we compete with large, diversified companies that have strengthened their interactive entertainment capabilities. Their greater financial and other resources may provide larger budgets to develop and market tools, technologies, products and services that gain consumer success and shift player time and engagement away from our products and services. We also continue to expect new entrants to emerge.\nMore broadly, we compete against providers of different sources of entertainment, such as movies, television, social media, online casual entertainment and music that our players could enjoy in their free time. Important competitive factors in our industry include the ability to attract creative and technical talent, game quality and ease of use, innovation, compatibility of products with certain consoles and other distribution channels, brand recognition, reputation, reliability, security, creativity, price, marketing, and quality of customer service.\n\nElectronic Arts is a global leader in digital interactive entertainment. We develop, market, publish and deliver games, content and services that can be experienced on game consoles, PCs and mobile devices.\nWe create innovative games and experiences that deliver high-quality interactive entertainment and drive engagement across our global network of hundreds of millions of players. We are focusing on building games and experiences that grow the global online communities around our key franchises; deepening engagement through connecting interactive storytelling to key intellectual property; and harnessing our communities to grow in, around, and beyond our games. We develop and publish games and experiences across diverse genres, such as sports, racing, first-person shooter, action, role-playing and simulation. We believe that our creative talent, production capabilities, broad portfolio of owned and licensed IP, and technological foundation, coupled with our network of hundreds of millions of players, provide us with strategic advantages.\nThrough our live services offerings, we offer high-quality experiences designed to provide value to players and extend and enhance gameplay. These live services include extra content, subscription offerings and other revenue generated outside of the sale of our full games. Our digital live services and other net revenue represented 73 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2025. We offer live services through our global football and American football franchises (which includes EA SPORTS College Football and EA SPORTS Madden NFL) and based on our iconic IP such as The Sims,\nand Battlefield.

With respect to our digitally-delivered products and services, the console manufacturers pay us either a wholesale price or a royalty percentage on the revenue they derive from their sales of our products and services. Our transactions for packaged goods products are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, which are accepted on a case-by-case basis. Our packaged goods games are sold directly to mass market retailers, specialty stores and through distribution arrangements. For packaged goods products, we pay the console manufacturers a per-unit royalty for each unit manufactured. Many key commercial terms of our relationships with Sony and Microsoft — such as manufacturing terms, delivery times, policies and approval conditions — are determined unilaterally, and are subject to change by the console manufacturers.\nThe publishing agreements also require us to indemnify the console manufacturers for any loss, liability and expense resulting from any claim against the console manufacturer regarding our products and services, including any claims for patent, copyright or trademark infringement brought against the console manufacturers. Each agreement may be terminated by the console manufacturers if a breach or default by us is not cured after we receive written notice from the console manufacturers, or if we become insolvent. The console manufacturers are not obligated to enter into license agreements with us for any future consoles, products or services.\n. We distribute our mobile applications and additional content through distributors such as Apple and Google. Our applications are downloaded for mobile devices from third party application storefronts. The distributor collects payment from consumers for content purchased within the application or charges consumers a one-time fee to download the application. Our distribution agreements establish the amounts that are retained by the distributor and the amounts passed through to us. These arrangements are typically terminable on short notice. The agreements generally do not obligate the distributors to market or distribute any of our applications.\n\nWe expect developments in artificial intelligence to accelerate the production of our products and services and enable new experiences for our players.\nIntellectual Property and Technology\nTo establish and protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, patents, patent applications, trade secrets, know-how, license agreements, confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions. We actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, but the laws of some countries in which we operate, particularly in Asia, either do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States or are poorly enforced. As our digital business has grown, our products and services increasingly depend on the reliability, availability and security of our technological infrastructure. In addition, we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services, including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and re-balancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered.\nGovernmental Regulation\nWe are a global company subject to various and complex laws and regulations domestically and internationally, including laws and regulations related to gaming, user privacy, data collection and retention, consumer protection, protection of minors, online safety, content, advertising, localization, information security, intellectual property, competition, sanctions, addressing climate change, taxation, and employment, among others. Many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing, and the application to, and impact on, us is uncertain. Certain of our business models, including those that utilize virtual items and virtual currency, are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations that have limited or restricted, and may continue to limit or restrict, the sale of our products and services in certain territories.\nWe have historically experienced the highest percentage of our net bookings in our third fiscal quarter.\nAs of March 31, 2025, we employed approximately 14,500 people globally, with 68% percent located internationally.

We have teams focused on developing new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of our offerings. For example, we are investing, and intend to continue to invest, in research and development to incorporate artificial intelligence into our products and services.\n\nWe aim to bring our workforce together in an environment where creativity thrives, perspectives are invited, and people feel valued. We monitor employee sentiment through regular engagement surveys that address areas such as career development, manager performance and job satisfaction.\nOur compensation programs and practices are designed ",

We develop, market, publish and deliver games, content and services that can be experienced on game consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. We create innovative games and experiences that deliver high-quality interactive entertainment and drive engagement across our global network of hundreds of millions of players. Through our live services offerings, we offer high-quality experiences designed to provide value to players and extend and enhance gameplay. These live services include extra content, subscription offerings and other revenue generated in addition to the sale of our full games. We are focusing on building games and experiences that grow the global online communities around our key franchises; deepening engagement through connecting interactive storytelling to key intellectual property; and harnessing our communities to grow in, around, and beyond our games.\nOur key financial results for our fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 were as follows:\nTotal net revenue was $7,463 million, down 1 percent year-over-year.\nLive services and other net revenue was $5,461 million, down 2 percent year-over-year.\nGross margin was 79.3 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year.\nOperating expenses were $4,400 million, up 2 percent year-over-year.\nOperating income was $1,520 million, flat year-over-year.\nNet income was $1,121 million with diluted earnings per share of $4.25.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2,079 million, down 10 percent year-over-year.\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2,248 million.\nWe returned $2,699 million to stockholders through our capital return programs, repurchasing 17.6 million shares for approximately $2,500 million and returning $199 million through our quarterly cash dividend program.\nTrends in Our Business\nLive Services Business.\nWe offer our players high-quality experiences designed to provide value to players and to extend and enhance gameplay. These live services include extra content, subscription offerings and other revenue generated in addition to the sale of our full games and free-to-play games. Our net revenue attributable to live services and other was $5,461 million, $5,547 million, and $5,489 million for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business. Within live services and other, net revenue attributable to extra content was $4,365 million, $4,463 million, and $4,277 million for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Growth in live services net revenue, including extra content may not be linear due to the competitive landscape, consumer buying patterns, and other factors. Our most popular live services are the extra content in the\nmode associated with our sports franchises.\nallows players to collect current and former players in order to build and compete as a personalized team. Live services net revenue generated from extra content purchased within\n, a substantial portion of which was derived from FC\n, is material to our business.\nDigital Delivery of Games.\nIn our industry, players increasingly purchase games digitally as opposed to purchasing physical discs. While this trend, as applied to our business, may not be linear due to a mix of products during a fiscal year, consumer buying patterns and other factors, over time we expect players to continue to purchase a higher proportion of our games digitally. As a result, we expect net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads to increase over time and net revenue attributable to sales of packaged goods to decrease.\nOur net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads was $1,478 million, $1,343 million, and $1,262 million during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively; while our net revenue attributable to packaged goods sales was $524 million,\n$672 million, and $675 million in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. In addition, as measured based on total units sold on Microsoft’s Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Sony’s PlayStation 4 and 5 rather than by net revenue, we estimate that 78 percent, 73 percent, and 68 percent of our total units sold during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, were sold digitally. Digital full game units are based on sales information provided by Microsoft and Sony; packaged goods units sold through are estimated by obtaining data from significant retail and distribution partners in North America, Europe and Asia, and applying internal sales estimates with respect to retail partners from which we do not obtain data. We believe that these percentages are reasonable estimates of the proportion of our games that are digitally downloaded in relation to our total number of units sold for the applicable period of measurement.\nIncreases in consumer adoption of digital purchase of games combined with increases in our live services revenue generally results in expansion of our gross margin, as costs associated with selling a game digitally are generally less than selling the same game through traditional retail and distribution channels.\nIncreased Competition.\nCompetition in our business is intense. Our competitors range from established interactive entertainment companies to emerging start-ups. In addition, we compete with large, diversified companies that have strengthened their interactive entertainment capabilities. Our competitors have access to certain resources such as larger budgets, tools, technologies, or IP portfolios that can lead to greater consumer success and shift player time and engagement away from our products and services. In addition, our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting our executives, as well as key creative and technical talent, resulting in retention challenges and increased cost to retain and incentivize our key people.\nConcentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Games\n. In our industry, we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from games based on a few popular titles, such as EA SPORTS FC, EA SPORTS College Football, EA SPORTS Madden NFL,\n, Battlefield, and The Sims. In particular, we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from our global football franchise, the annualized version of which is consistently one of the best-selling games in the marketplace.\n. In order to improve transparency into our business, we disclose an operating performance metric, net bookings. Net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period. Net bookings is calculated by adding total net revenue to the change in deferred net revenue for online-enabled games.\nThe following is a calculation of our total net bookings for the periods presented:\nYear Ended March 31,\nChange in deferred net revenue (online-enabled games)\nNet bookings were $7,355 million for fiscal year 2025 primarily driven by sales related to our global football, American football, and\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31.

Our results of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 contained 52 weeks and ended on March 30, 2024. For simplicity of disclosure, all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar month end.\nNet revenue consists of sales generated from (1) full games sold as digital downloads or as packaged goods and designed for play on game consoles and PCs, (2) live services which primarily includes sales of extra content for console, PC, and mobile games, (3) subscriptions that generally offer access to a selection of full games, in-game content, online services and other benefits, and (4) licensing our games to third parties to distribute and host our games and content.\nComparison of Fiscal Year 2025 to Fiscal Year 2024\nNet revenue for fiscal year 2025 was $7,463 million, primarily driven by sales related to our global football and American football franchises,\n. Net revenue for fiscal year 2025 decreased $99 million, as compared to fiscal year 2024. This decrease was driven by a $789 million decrease in net revenue primarily due to decreased sales of extra content for A\nand the prior year release of\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\n, partially offset by a $690 million increase in net revenue primarily from our American football franchises, driven by\nEA SPORTS College Football 2\nNet Revenue by Composition\nOur net revenue by composition for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended March 31,\nLive services and other\nFull Game Net Revenue\nFull game net revenue includes full game downloads and packaged goods. Full game downloads primarily include revenue from digital sales of full games on console, PC, and certain licensing revenue. Packaged goods primarily includes revenue from full games that are sold physically to mass market retailers, specialty stores and through distribution arrangements.\nFull game net revenue for fiscal year 2025 was $2,002 million, primarily driven by\nEA SPORTS FC 25, EA SPORTS College Football 25, EA SPORTS FC 24\nEA SPORTS Madden NFL 25\n. Full game net revenue for fiscal year 2025 decreased $13 million, or 1 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by the prior year release of\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\n, and legacy FIFA titles within our global football franchise, partially offset by our American football franchises driven by\nEA SPORTS College Football 25\nand our EA SPORTS FC franchise.\nLive Services and Other Net Revenue\nLive services and other net revenue primarily includes revenue from sales of extra content for console, PC, and mobile games, certain licensing revenue, subscriptions, and advertising.\nLive services and other net revenue for fiscal year 2025 was $5,461 million, primarily driven by sales of extra content for our global football and American football franchises,\n.

The decrease was primarily due to a year-over-year decrease in product related and royalty costs associated with our EA SPORTS FC franchise, a decrease in platform and online hosting fees, and a decrease in acquisition-related intangible asset amortization and impairment, partially offset by a net increase in royalty costs due to the mix of sales from other royalty bearing titles.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnel-related costs, related overhead costs, external third-party development costs, contracted services, and depreciation. Research and development expenses for our online products include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games. Research and development expenses also include expenses associated with our digital platform, software licenses and maintenance, and management overhead.\nResearch and development expenses for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were as follows (in millions):\nResearch and development expenses increased by $149 million, or 6 percent, in fiscal year 2025, as compared to fiscal year 2024.

This increase was primarily due to a $20 million increase in personnel-related costs, a $9 million increase in stock-based compensation, and a $13 million increase in IT and facility-related costs.\nProvision for income taxes for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was as follows (in millions):\nOur effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 was 30.2 percent as compared to 19.9 percent in fiscal year 2024.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, we recognized a $51 million tax charge to increase the valuation allowance on Swiss deferred tax assets as a result of various factors including our business operations, geographical income mix, and an increase in the Swiss interest rates. Excluding the effect of the change in valuation allowance, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 would have been 27.0 percent.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we recognized a $92 million tax benefit to remeasure our Swiss deferred tax assets as a result of an increase in the Swiss statutory tax rate. In addition, we recognized a lower period cost for U.S. tax on our non-U.S. earnings, including a cumulative one-time benefit, due to R&D capitalization guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury during the fiscal year. Excluding the effects of these items, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 would have been 26.7 percent.\nOur effective tax rates for future periods will continue to depend on a variety of factors, including changes in our business, such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions, our corporate structure, the geographic location of business functions or assets, the geographic mix of income, our agreements with tax authorities, appli",
