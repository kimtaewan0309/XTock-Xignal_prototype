MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following combined Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. However, none of the registrants make any representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the Subsidiary Registrants of Duke Energy other than itself.\nDUKE ENERGY\nDuke Energy, an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, operates in the U.S. primarily through its subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. Duke Energy’s consolidated financial information includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nActing on Investment Opportunities.\nWe operate in some of the most attractive jurisdictions in the country and the affordable, reliable power we provide continues to play a key role in bringing business and job growth to our region. Our service territories continue to experience accelerating investment opportunities driven by a deepening economic development pipeline and significant customer growth. To efficiently fund this growth and the related capital required in the coming years, we entered into two strategic transactions in the third quarter of 2025.\nIn August 2025, we entered into an investment agreement to receive $6 billion in exchange for a 19.7% indirect investment in Duke Energy Florida. Subject to regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to be completed through a series of closings starting in 2026 through mid-2028. In July 2025, we announced the sale of Piedmont’s Tennessee business to Spire Inc. for $2.48 billion. Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect to complete the Piedmont transaction on March 31, 2026. Proceeds from both transactions will support Duke Energy’s expanded capital plan and replaces certain originally planned long-term debt and common equity issuances through 2029.\nBoth of these transactions, along with our unwavering focus on operational excellence and value creation, demonstrate our continued ability to meet the unprecedented long-term growth anticipated across our service territories. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Dispositions,\" for further information.\nBuilding a Smarter Energy Future.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we continued to move our regulatory strategy forward and execute on investments for building a smarter energy future while maintaining our focus on safety and operational excellence, our customers, growth of our business as well as the engagement and empowerment of our employees. These priorities enable us to provide strong, sustainable value for our employees, customers, communities and shareholders.\nIn January 2025, Piedmont and Duke Energy Indiana received constructive orders on their general rate cases from the NCUC and IURC, respectively. New rates were effective in November 2024 for Piedmont and late February 2025 for Duke Energy Indiana. New rates were also effective in January 2025 for Duke Energy Florida's new three-year rate plan. In June 2025, Duke Energy Progress filed a South Carolina base rate case and Duke Energy Kentucky filed a natural gas base rate case. In July 2025, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a South Carolina base rate case. In October 2025, Duke Energy Kentucky received a constructive order on its electric base rate case filed last December and Duke Energy Progress reached a comprehensive settlement in its South Carolina base rate case. Our regulatory efforts continue to focus on securing critical investments for reliable customer service while ensuring timely cost recovery across our service territories.\nIn October 2025, Duke Energy Progress received an order from the NCUC granting the CPCN for the second CC unit in Person County and Duke Energy Indiana received an order from the IURC granting the CPCN for the Cayuga CC project. Also in October 2025, Duke Energy Carolinas filed for a CECPCN with the PSCSC for a new CC unit in Anderson County, South Carolina. These advanced natural gas plants, along with our planned CTs, will provide critical generation as we continue to modernize our energy infrastructure in the coming years.\nWe reached key milestones to recover costs related to critical storm restoration activities from the 2024 historic storm season while also seeking to minimize customer bill impacts resulting from hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton. In February 2025, the FPSC voted to approve Duke Energy Florida's storm cost recovery of approximately $1.1 billion over 12 months beginning in March 2025. During 2025, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress reached constructive settlements in Phase 2 proceedings and\nfinancing orders have been issued by both the NCUC and PSCSC. In Septe\nmber 2025, we issued North Carolina storm recovery bonds and expect to securitize the related South Carolina storm costs by the end of 2025.\nOur nuclear sites continue to positively impact the customers we serve by safely producing clean, reliable and low-cost electricity, as well as providing economic benefits for our local communities that includes thousands of well-paying jobs and significant tax benefits. During 2025, we continue to sell nuclear PTCs to further reduce the cost of electricity for our customers. Additionally, in March 2025, the NRC issued a subsequent license renewal for Oconee that allows an additional 20 years of operation through 2054. Oconee is the first Duke Energy nuclear facility to reach this significant approval milestone to permit extension of its operations to 80 years. In April 2025, we submitted an application to the NRC for Robinson to extend the plant's operations an additional 20 years through 2050.\nIn July 2025, Duke Energy Carolinas filed its final license application with the FERC to extend the operating license for the Bad Creek Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Station. Located in South Carolina, Bad Creek is designed to produce significant amounts of energy when our customers need it most, performing a vital role on the company's system since 1991. If approved, the application would extend plant operations for an additional 50 years through 2077.\nMD&A\nDUKE ENERGY\napplications with the NCUC, PSCSC and FERC to combine our utilities that operate in the Carolinas, by which Duke Energy Progress will merge into Duke Energy Carolinas. This proposed transaction would result in a single electric utility serving our\nNorth Carolina and S\nouth Carolina service territories. The single utility’s ability to plan, execute and operate resources more efficiently is expected to result in substantial cost savings to benefit customers by reducing the overall costs to serve. The targeted effective date is January 1, 2027, subject to regulatory approvals.\nOperational Excellence.\nIn June 2025, as the summer's first heat wave brought triple-digit temperatures to parts of North Carolina and South Carolina, our customers set a new summertime record for electricity usage, surpassing the previous summertime record set in July 2024. We maintain our focus on operational excellence and prepare for extreme weather by identifying potential risks, effectively maintaining adequate short-term planning reserves, leveraging outage scheduling optimization and controlling planned and emergent equipment issues.\nEconomic Development.\nIn June 2025, the governor of North Carolina announced Amazon is planning to invest an estimated $10 billion to launch a new high-tech cloud computing and artificial intelligence innovation campus in Richmond County, North Carolina. The site selected for this project was included in Duke Energy's Site Readiness Program in 2019, a program that helps state, regional and local economic development partners increase the competitiveness of potential industrial land. These new data centers will be located in Duke Energy Progress' service territory and the investment is expected to be among the largest in North Carolina's history, a testament to the impactful and ongoing work of continuing to bring economic development success to the vibrant communities we proudly serve.\nSee Notes 4 and 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Income Taxes,\" for additional information.\nMatters Impacting Future Results\nThe matters discussed herein could materially impact the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants and Business Segments.\nIn April 2024, the EPA issued the 2024 CCR Rule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule by establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities. Duke Energy is participating in legal challenges to the 2024 CCR Rule.\nCost recovery for future expenditures is anticipated and will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations. For more information, see \"Other Matters\" and Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters.\"\nFrom August through October 2024, a series of major storm events occurred that resulted in significant damage to utility infrastructure within our service territories and primarily impacted Duke Energy Carolinas', Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Florida's electric utility operations. Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented damage to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the weste"
