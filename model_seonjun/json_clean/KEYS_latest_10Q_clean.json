(“we,” “us,” “our,” “Keysight” or “the company”), incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2013, is a global innovator in the computing, communications and electronics market, committed to advancing our customers’ business success by helping them solve critical challenges in the development and commercialization of their products and services. Our mission, “accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world,” speaks to the value we provide our customers in a world of ever-increasing technological complexity. We deliver this value through a broad range of design and test solutions that address the critical challenges our customers face in bringing their innovations to market on ever-shorter schedules.\nWe invest in research and development (“R&D”) to align our business with available markets and position the company for growth. Our R&D efforts focus on the development of new software and hardware products, as well as improvements to existing products, and solutions aligned to the industries that we serve. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuous flow of innovative, high-quality software, solutions, products and services. We remain committed to investment in R&D and have focused our development efforts on strategic opportunities to capture future growth.\nImpact of U.S. government tariffs\nBeginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the U.S. government announced tariffs on products from all countries and additional reciprocal tariffs on certain countries. In response, China and other countries announced retaliatory tariffs against certain imports from the United States. There have been recent changes effective August 1, 2025, resulting in broad-based increases in tariff rates. These tariffs have impacted our financial results for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025. We continue to closely monitor and assess the potential impact of these tariffs on our results and take actions across multiple vectors to reduce the impact. This multipronged mitigation approach spans our global manufacturing footprint and sourcing strategies, as well as pricing and cost actions. For additional discussion of risks related to tariffs and trade relations, please refer to the risk factor, in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThree and nine months ended July 31, 2025 and 2024\nTotal orders for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 were $1,340 million and $3,919 million, respectively, an increase of 7 percent and 6 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025, foreign currency movements had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point and an immaterial impact on the year-over-year change, respectively. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025, acquisitions had an immaterial impact on the year-over-year change. For the three months ended July 31, 2025, orders increased in the Americas and Europe, partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific. For the nine months ended July 31, 2025, orders increased across all regions.\nRevenue for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 was $1,352 million and $3,956 million, respectively, an increase of 11 percent and 7 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025, foreign currency movements had a favorable impact of 2 percentage points and an immaterial impact on the year-over-year change, respectively. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025, acquisitions had an immaterial impact on the year-over-year change. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025, revenue increased in both the Communications Solutions Group (“CSG”) and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (“EISG”). Revenue from CSG and EISG represented 70 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of total revenue for the three months ended July 31, 2025. Revenue from CSG and EISG represented 69 percent and 31 percent, respectively, of total revenue for the nine months ended July 31, 2025.\nNet income for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 was $191 million and $617 million, respectively, compared to $389 million and $687 million, respectively, for the same periods last year. The decrease in net income for the three months ended July 31, 2025 was primarily driven by a prior year income tax benefit due to one-time discrete tax items, higher people related costs, net\nlosses on derivative instruments and higher acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by higher revenue and net gains on our equity investments. The decrease in net income for the nine months ended July 31, 2025 was primarily driven by a prior year income tax benefit due to one-time discrete tax items, higher people related costs, higher acquisition and integration costs and net\n, partially offset by higher revenue and net gains on our equity investments and derivative instruments.\nOur first-to-market solutions strategy enables customers to develop new technologies and accelerate innovation and provides a platform for Keysight's long-term growth. Our customers are expected to continue to make R&D investments in certain next-generation technologies and applications, including evolution of 5G, early 6G, high-speed data center networks and infrastructure, satellite networks, Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), industrial internet of things (“IoT”), defense modernization, and next generation electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. We continue to engage actively with our customers and closely monitor the current macroeconomic environment, including tariffs, trade restrictions and tightening of export control regulations, monetary and fiscal policies, and geopolitical tensions. We remain confident in the long-term secular growth trends of our markets and our ability to outperform in a variety of market conditions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.\nCurrency Exchange Rate Exposure\nOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating, investing and financing activities. We hedge revenues, expenses, and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short-term and anticipated basis. The result of the hedging has been included in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and condensed consolidated statement of operations. We experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the condensed consolidated balance sheet and condensed consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our cash flow hedging program is designed to hedge short-term currency movements based on a rolling period of up to twelve months. Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.\nResults from Operations - Three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 and 2024\nA summary of our results is as follows:\n\n(in millions, except percentages)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 was lower than the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by U.S. taxes on those earnings and the impact of Pillar Two minimum taxes.\nIn July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted into law in the U.S. The OBBBA includes numerous provisions that affect corporate taxation, including changes to bonus depreciation, the expensing of domestic research costs, and modifications to certain U.S. international tax rules. The company has analyzed the impacts of the OBBBA and reflected them in the current period. These impacts do not have a material effect on the tax rate for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025. The majority of the tax law changes will take effect in future years.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) reached agreement among certain member countries to implement a global minimum tax framework, commonly referred to as Pillar Two, which established a minimum 15 percent income tax rate. Various countries have passed legislation to comply with the Pillar Two model rules. A subset of these rules became effective for Keysight in the current fiscal year. While we expect to meet transitional safe harbor requirements in most jurisdictions, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where we expect Pillar Two taxes to apply. The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 included the effects of Pillar Two taxes.\nThe income tax expense for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 was higher compared to the same periods last year primarily due to the inclusion of one-time discrete tax benefits from U.S. amended tax return filings in relation to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax regulations and the settlement of a Malaysia uncertain tax position in the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024. The income tax expense for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 included a net discrete expense of $\nmillion, respectively. The income tax expense"
