  "item2_clean": "Fiscal 2026 First Quarter Results\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, results reflected a decrease in net sales, with organic (excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange) decreases in our Grocery & Snacks and International segments, partially offset by increases in our Refrigerated & Frozen and Foodservice segments, in each case compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Overall gross profit decreased primarily due to the impacts of lower net sales, input cost inflation, and a reduction in profit from divested businesses, partially offset by productivity. Excluding items impacting comparability, overall segment operating profit decreased in our Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, and Foodservice segments, slightly offset by an increase in our International segment compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Corporate expenses and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were nearly flat compared to the prior year. We recognized lower interest expense and higher income tax expense, in each case compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Excluding items impacting comparability, our effective tax rate was higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nDiluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025 was $0.34 and $0.97, respectively. Diluted earnings per share was affected by lower net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. See\n“Items Impacting Comparability”\nbelow as several items affected the comparability of year-over-year results.\nTrends Impacting Our Business\nOur industry continues to be impacted by shifting consumer behavior, commodity cost fluctuations, labor cost inflation, input cost inflation, supply chain pressures, exchange rate volatility, and other global macroeconomic challenges. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we saw a modest impact to our financial results due to increased costs resulting from recent changes to trade policies, which we largely mitigated. In addition, we continued to experience an elevated amount of input cost inflation, which we were able to partially offset through our on-going productivity initiatives.\nWe expect inflation and tariffs to negatively impact our\ncosts of goods sold in fiscal 2026. While we continue to expect consumer trends to improve over time, in the near-term, we expect weak consumer sentiment to continue to negatively impact our volumes during fiscal 2026. We will continue to evaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment and take action to mitigate negative impacts on our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.\nItems Impacting Comparability\nSegment presentation of gains and losses from derivatives used for economic hedging of anticipated commodity input costs and foreign currency exchange rate risks of anticipated transactions is discussed in further detail in Note 8,\n“Derivative Financial Instruments”\n, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. We had $2.2 million and $1.3 million of derivative losses in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively, which were included in general corporate expenses and reflected as items impacting comparability.\nOther items of note impacting comparability for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 included the following:\nA net gain of $42.4 million ($20.4 million after-tax loss) associated with the divestiture of our\nand frozen fish businesses and\ncharges totaling $4.4 million ($3.3 million after-tax) in connection with our restructuring plans.\nItems of note impacting comparability for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 included the following:\nan income tax benefit of $211.4 million primarily associated with the release of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets based upon interactions with the taxing authorities,\na gain of $17.0 million ($12.8 million after-tax) associated with insurance proceeds from the previous fire that occurred at one of our manufacturing facilities,\ncharges totaling $4.3 million ($3.2 million after-tax) in connection with our restructuring plans, and\nnet charges totaling $3.4 million ($2.6 million after-tax) related to legacy legal matters.\nSEGMENT REVIEW\nWe reflect our results of operations in four reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, and Foodservice.\n\nbusiness, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The first quarter of fiscal 2026 included inorganic net sales of $10.6 million associated with the acquisitions of Sweetwood Smoke & Co. in August 2024 and a contract manufacturer in July 2024 through the respective one-year anniversary of each acquisition.\nNet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment reflected an increase in organic volume of 0.5%, when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Organic price/mix decreased by 0.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025 included $4.9 million and $17.4 million, respectively, of net sales related to our frozen fish business, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Additionally, we estimate that net sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were impacted by approximately $24 million due to temporary manufacturing disruptions in our\nbusiness during the key grilling season.\nNet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 in our International segment reflected a 5.2% decrease in organic volumes, a 1.7% increase in organic price/mix, and a 1.3% decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, in each case compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The decrease in volume was driven by lower consumption trends which were seen in our regions. The unfavorable foreign exchange rates were primarily due to the strength of the US dollar relative to the Mexican Peso in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The first quarter of fiscal 2025 included $23.6 million of net sales related to our ownership stake in Agro Tech Foods Limited (“ATFL”), which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. In addition, the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025 included $1.1 million and $13.6 million, respectively, of net sales related to our\n\nbusiness, partially offset by productivity. In addition, we recognized a benefit of $3.3 million in the first quarter fiscal 2025 related to insurance proceeds for lost sales from our fiscal 2023 brand recall on\n. The decrease in operating profit also included an increase in SG&A expenses primarily related to incentive compensation.\nSegment operating profit in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment for the first quarter fiscal 2026 reflected a decrease in gross profits of $42.4 million compared to the first quarter fiscal 2025. The decrease was driven by the impacts of input cost inflation, unfavorable operating leverage, and a reduction in profit associated with the sale of our frozen fish business, partially offset by productivity. In addition, we estimate that gross profits during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were negatively impacted by approximately $10 million, primarily due to lost profits, abnormal manufacturing variances, and certain inventory write-offs resulting from the temporary manufacturing disruptions in our\nSegment operating profit in our International segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 reflected a decrease in gross profits of $5.4 million when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The decrease was driven by a reduction in profit associated with the sale of our ownership stake in ATFL and the impacts of input cost inflation, partially offset by productivity. The decrease in gross profits was more than offset by lower SG&A expenses and favorable foreign exchange rates.\nSegment operating profit in our Foodservice segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 reflected a decrease in gross profits of $6.6 million when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The decrease in gross profits was driven by the impacts of input cost inflation, unfavorable operating leverage, and a reduction in profit from divested businesses, partially offset by productivity.\n\nPension and Postretirement Non-service Income (Expense)\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, pension and postretirement non-service income was $6.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The first quarter of fiscal 2026 reflected lower interest costs as a result of the partial transfer of our U.S. defined benefit pension plan obligation to a third-party insurance provider through the purchase of an annuity contract in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\nInterest Expense, Net\nNet interest expense was $93.8 million and $105.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively.

See Note 12,\n, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for a discussion on the change in effective tax rates.\nDiluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025 was $0.34 and $0.97, respectively.
