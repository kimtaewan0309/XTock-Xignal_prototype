These conditions are commonly referred to as a soft market. Market conditions further softened in the third quarter of 2025, which continued a multi-year trend of declining freight volumes and transportation rates. This followed a brief period of improvement driven by seasonal produce and beverage demand that led to temporary regional rate spikes. Despite carriers continuing to exit the market, the level of attrition has not held pace with the decline in industry freight volumes. Industry volumes, as measured by the Cass Freight Index, declined approximately 7.0 percent in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024, adding to the oversupply of capacity and contributing to the sustained downward pressure on transportation rates. One of the key metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our Managed Solutions business. This metric measures the average number of carriers contacted before securing a transportation provider. Routing guide depth of 1 would be perfect performance and 2 would be extremely poor. In the third quarter of 2025, the average routing guide depth returned to 1.2 which is consistent with levels observed throughout 2023 and 2024 following a temporary increase to 1.3 in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nThe global forwarding market remained highly volatile throughout the third quarter of 2025, influenced by shifting tariff policies, softening demand, and carriers' strategic use of blank sailings to stabilize market conditions. Early in the quarter, the market experienced a brief rebound in freight volumes and a temporary surge in pricing, as shippers accelerated activity ahead of the expiration of the U.S. and China 90-day tariff pause. While the tariff landscape continues to evolve, market conditions have largely stabilized although pricing has rapidly declined across many trade lanes, driven by excess capacity and weak consumer sentiment. The air freight market has also stabilized at lower levels of pricing, as the excess capacity resulting from the end of the de minimis threshold has largely been rationalized. Depressed ocean freight rates and weak consumer demand have prompted more shippers to accept longer transit times by opting for the cost-efficiency of ocean freight. While shifting tariff policies, seasonal impacts, and other volatile market conditions can be expected to create ongoing volatility, freight pricing is likely to remain depressed until industry freight volumes show meaningful improvement.\nBUSINESS TRENDS\nOur surface transportation business continued to navigate the soft market conditions discussed in the market trends section during the third quarter of 2025. Our average truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 1.5 percent during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024, reflecting the downward pressure from market rates. Our average truckload linehaul rate charged to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, also decreased approximately 1.5 percent during the third quarter of 2025 resulting in our truckload adjusted gross profit per transaction in the third quarter of 2025 holding consistent compared to the same period in 2024. Our less than truckload (“LTL”) adjusted gross profits per transaction showed strong improvement driven by the continued advancement of our dynamic pricing and costing capabilities. Despite the challenging soft market conditions, our combined North American Surface Transportation (“NAST”) truckload and LTL volume significantly outperformed the Cass Freight Index, increasing 3.0 percent in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024.\nOur global forwarding results in the third quarter of 2025 reflected the continued impact of the volatile market conditions and shifting trade policies outlined in the market trends section above. Our ocean freight shipments decreased 7.0 percent compared to the third quarter of 2024, as elevated inventory levels and weak consumer sentiment contributed to sluggish demand across many trade lanes. While the beginning of the period saw a brief rebound in ocean freight volumes and pricing ahead of the expiration of the U.S. and China 90-day tariff pause it was short-lived, and volume and pricing fell rapidly during the remainder of the third quarter of 2025. Adjusted gross profit per ocean shipment declined 27.5 percent compared to the elevated levels in the third quarter of 2024, driven by excess capacity and depressed pricing across many trade lanes. Our air freight results also reflected these market dynamics as air freight volumes declined, with overall tonnage down 10.0 percent compared to the third quarter of 2024.\nAs part of our enterprise strategy to drive focus on profitable growth in our four core modes—North American truckload and LTL and global ocean and air—as engines to ignite growth and create the most value for our stakeholders we divested our Europe Surface Transportation business. The sale closed effective February 1, 2025. Europe Surface Transportation provided transportation and logistics services, including truckload and LTL transportation services across Europe, and represented the majority of our Other Surface Transportation operations included in All Other and Corporate.\nSELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS\nThe following summarizes select third quarter 2025 year-over-year operating comparisons to the third quarter 2024:\nTotal revenues decreased 10.9 percent to $4.1 billion, primarily driven by lower pricing and volume in our ocean services, the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business, and lower pricing in our truckload services. This was partially offset by higher volume in our truckload services.\nGross profits decreased 4.4 percent to $691.7 million. Adjusted gross profits decreased 4.0 percent to $706.1 million, primarily driven by lower adjusted gross profit per transaction and volume in our ocean services and the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business. This was partially offset by higher adjusted gross profit per transaction in our LTL and customs services and higher volume in our truckload services.\nPersonnel expenses decreased 3.4 percent to $349.3 million, primarily due to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business, cost optimization efforts and productivity improvements. This was partially offset by higher restructuring charges related to workforce reductions. Average employee headcount decreased 10.8 percent.\nOther selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased 29.8 percent to $135.9 million primarily due to a $57.0 million loss in the prior year related to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business.\nIncome from operations increased 22.6 percent to $220.8 million, due to the decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by the decrease in adjusted gross profit.\n\nAdjusted operating margin of 31.3 percent increased 680 basis points.\nInterest and other income/expense, net totaled $15.6 million of expense, consisting primarily of $15.8 million of interest expense, which decreased $6.3 million compared to last year due to a lower average debt balance and lower variable interest rates.\nThe effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.6 percent compared to 32.4 percent in the third quarter last year.\nNet income totaled $163.0 million, an increase of 67.6 percent from a year ago.\nDiluted earnings per share increased 67.5 percent to $1.34.\nCash flow from operations increased $368.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily driven by an increase in net income and rapidly declining ocean freight rates.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nPurchased transportation and related services\nPurchased products sourced for resale\nOther selling, general, and administrative expenses\nTotal costs and expenses\nIncome from operations\nInterest and other income/expense, net\nIncome before provision for income taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nDiluted net income per share\nAverage employee headcount\nAdjusted gross profit margin percentage\nTotal adjusted gross profit margin\n________________________________\nAdjusted gross profit margin is a non-GAAP financial measure explained above.\nA reconciliation of our reportable segments to our consolidated results can be found in Note 8,\n\nConsolidated Results of Operations—Three Months Ended September 30, 2025, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nTotal revenues and direct costs.\nTotal transportation reve"
