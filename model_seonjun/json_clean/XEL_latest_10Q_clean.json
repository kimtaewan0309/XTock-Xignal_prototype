It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements. Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy’s operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.\nThe demand for electric power and natural gas is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. In general, peak sales of electricity occur in the summer months, and peak sales of natural gas occur in the winter months. As a result, the overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Additionally, Xcel Energy’s operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted EPS. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that adjusts measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nXcel Energy’s management uses non-GAAP measures for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining performance-based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures.\nEarnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)\nGAAP diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.’s diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method.\nOngoing earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP earnings (net income) for certain items. Ongoing diluted EPS for Xcel Energy is calculated by dividing net income or loss, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss for such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of Xcel Energy’s core earnings and underlying performance. For instance, to present ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted EPS, we may adjust the related GAAP amounts for certain items that are non-recurring in nature. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP earnings (net income) to ongoing earnings:\nThree Months Ended Sept. 30\nNine Months Ended Sept. 30\n(Millions of Dollars)\nSherco Unit 3 2011 outage refunds\nMarshall Wildfire litigation\nSherco Unit 3 2011 Outage Refunds —\nNSP-Minnesota’s Sherco Unit 3 experienced an extended outage following a 2011 incident which damaged its turbine. In October 2024 following contested case procedures, the MPUC ordered a customer refund of $46 million for replacement power incurred during the outage, which is presented as a non-recurring charge to electric revenues.\nMarshall Wildfire Litigation\nIn the third quarter of 2025, PSCo recognized a non-recurring $287 million charge as a result of a settlement reached with the plaintiffs in the Marshall Wildfire litigation.\nResults of Operations\nThe only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Xcel Energy Inc. Diluted earnings and EPS of each subsidiary discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such subsidiary but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole.\nXcel Energy’s third quarter GAAP diluted earnings were $0.88 per share compared with $1.21 per share in the same period in 2024 and ongoing earnings were $1.24 compared with $1.25 per share in 2024. The change in ongoing earnings per share was primarily driven by higher depreciation, interest charges and O&M expenses partially offset by increased recovery of infrastructure investments. Fluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes in fuel and purchased power and/or natural gas sold and transported generally do not significantly impact earnings (changes in costs are offset by the related variation in revenues).\nSummarized diluted EPS for Xcel Energy:\nThree Months Ended Sept. 30\nNine Months Ended Sept. 30\nDiluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share\nSPS\nEarnings from equity method investments — WYCO\nXcel Energy Inc. and Other\nSherco Unit 3 2011 outage refunds\nMarshall Wildfire settlement\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\n— GAAP earnings increased $0.08 per share and ongoing earnings increased\nfor the third quarter. Year-to-date GAAP earnings increased $0.11 per share and ongoing earnings increased\nper share. The year-to-date ongoing earnings increase was driven by higher recovery of electric infrastructure investments, which was partially offset by increased O&M expenses, depreciation and interest charges.\n— GAAP earnings decreased $0.37 per share and ongoing earnings decreased $0.01 for the third quarter of 2025. Year-to-date GAAP earnings decreased $0.27 and ongoing earnings increased $0.09. The year-to-date ongoing earnings increase was driven by higher recovery of electric and natural gas infrastructure investments, which was partially offset by increased depreciation and interest charges.\nSPS\n— GAAP and ongoing earnings decreased $0.04 per share for the third quarter and decreased $0.03 year-to-date. The year-to-date change was driven by unfavorable weather, increased interest charges and O&M expenses, partially offset by higher recovery of electric infrastructure investments and sales growth.\n— GAAP and ongoing earnings per share were flat for the third quarter of 2025 and year-to-date. The year-to-date change was driven by higher recovery of electric and natural gas infrastructure investments, which was offset by increased depreciation and O&M expenses.\nXcel Energy Inc. and Other\n— Primarily includes financing costs and interest income at the holding company and earnings from investment funds, which are accounted for as equity method investments. The change in earnings was largely due to gains on debt repurchases, partially offset by higher interest rates and debt levels and the performance of the equity method investments, which primarily invest in energy technology companies.\nChanges in GAAP and Ongoing EPS\nComponents significantly contributing to changes in 2025 EPS compared to 2024:\nDiluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share\nThree Months Ended Sept. 30\nNine Months Ended Sept. 30\nGAAP EPS — 2024\n\nCost of electric fuel and purchased power and natural gas sold and transported are generally recovered through regulatory recovery mechanisms and offset in revenue.\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nStatement of Income Analysis\nThe following summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated statements of income.\nEstimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings\n—Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related operating expenses that could result due to storm activity or vegetation management requirements.\nAs a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy’s financial performance. Gas decoupling mechanisms (and electric sales true-up in 2024) in Minnesota predominately mitigate the positive and adverse impacts of weather in that jurisdiction.\nDegree-day or THI data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day’s average temperature and humidity. HDD is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65° Fahrenheit. CDD is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65° Fahrenheit.\nEach degree of temperature above 65° Fahrenheit is counted as one CDD, and each degree of temperature below 65° Fahrenheit is counted as one HDD. In Xcel Energy’s more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor to CDD. HDD, CDD and THI are most likely to impact the usage of Xcel Energy’s residential and commercial customers. Industrial customers are less sensitive to weather. Typically, sales are not impacted in the first or fourth quarter due to THI or CDD.\nNormal weather conditions are defined as either the 10, 20 or 30 y"
