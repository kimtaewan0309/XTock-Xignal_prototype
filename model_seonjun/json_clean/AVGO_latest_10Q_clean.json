Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Broadcom,” “we,” “our,” and “us” mean Broadcom Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Our semiconductor solutions include a broad portfolio of complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices, analog III-V based products, network interface cards and other modules, switches, subsystems and, in some cases, racks that are used in a wide array of environments, end products and applications such as artificial intelligence (“AI”) and enterprise data centers, servers, networking and connectivity equipment, storage systems, home connectivity devices, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Our portfolio of infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking (“FC SAN”) products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.\nWe have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Our semiconductor solutions segment includes all of our semiconductor-based product lines and intellectual property (“IP”) licensing. Our infrastructure software segment includes our private and hybrid cloud, application development and delivery, software-defined edge, application networking and security, mainframe, distributed and cybersecurity solutions, and our FC SAN business.\nQuarterly Highlights\nHighlights during the fiscal quarter ended August 3, 2025 include the following:\nWe generated $7,166 million of cash from operations.\nWe paid $2,786 million in cash dividends.\nWe issued $6,000 million of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds to repay the outstanding balance of our floating rate unsecured term loan.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue recognition, business combinations, valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets, and income taxes.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nWe are subject to risks and exposures from the evolving macroeconomic environment, including uncertainty and volatility in financial markets, efforts of governments to stimulate or stabilize the economy and other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, as well as an increase in trade tensions and related tariffs with U.S. trading partners. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these risks and exposures may cause our net revenue to fluctuate significantly and disrupt supply chain operations, and we continuously monitor the broader impacts of these circumstances on our business, our supply chain and our results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Quarter and Three Fiscal Quarters Ended August 3, 2025 Compared to Fiscal Quarter and Three Fiscal Quarters Ended August 4, 2024\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented:\nFiscal Quarter Ended\n(As a percentage of net revenue)\nStatements of Operations Data:\nSubscriptions and services\nCost of products sold\nCost of subscriptions and services\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nRestructuring charges\nTotal cost of revenue\nResearch and development\nSelling, general and administrative\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nRestructuring and other charges\nTotal operating expenses\nThree Fiscal Quarters Ended\n(As a percentage of net revenue)\nStatements of Operations Data:\nSubscriptions and services\nCost of products sold\nCost of subscriptions and services\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nRestructuring charges\nTotal cost of revenue\nResearch and development\nSelling, general and administrative\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nRestructuring and other charges\nTotal operating expenses\nA relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. Direct sales to one semiconductor solutions customer, which is a distributor, accounted for 32% and 30% of our net revenue for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended August 3, 2025, respectively, and 26% and 27% of our net revenue for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended August 4, 2024, respectively.\nWe believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 40% of our net revenue for each of the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended August 3, 2025, and 35% and 40% of our net revenue for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended August 4, 2024, respectively. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders, causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. This is particularly true of our products used in AI and wireless applications as fluctuations may be magnified by the timing of customer deployments, as well as product launches and seasonal variations for wireless applications. For infrastructure software, the transition to subscription licenses, as well as whether or not a customer has the right to terminate, causes variations in revenue recognized in each period.\nThe following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented:\nFiscal Quarter Ended\nThree Fiscal Quarters Ended\nNet Revenue by Segment\n(Dollars in millions)\nSemiconductor solutions\nInfrastructure software\nFiscal Quarter Ended\nThree Fiscal Quarters Ended\nNet Revenue by Segment\n(As a percentage of net revenue)\nSemiconductor solutions\nInfrastructure software\nNet revenue from our\nsemiconductor solutions segment increased in the fiscal quarter and\nthree fiscal quarters\nAugust 3, 2025 compared to the prior year fiscal periods due to strong demand for our networking products, primarily custom AI accelerators and AI networking solutions.\nNet revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased\nin the fiscal quarter and\nthree fiscal quarters\nAugust 3, 2025 compared to the prior year fiscal periods primarily due to strong demand for our VMware Cloud Foundation (“VCF”) product, including additional license revenue recognized on contracts where customers do not have the right to terminate and the transition to a subscription license model.\nGross margin was $10,703 million for the fiscal quarter ended August 3, 2025 compared to $8,356 million for the fiscal quarter ended August 4, 2024, and $31,045 million for the three fiscal quarters ended August 3, 2025 compared to $23,507 million for the three fiscal quarters ended August 4, 2024. The increases were primarily due to higher software revenue and strong product demand for our AI-related semiconductor solutions.\nAs a percentage of net revenue, gross margin was 67% and 68% of net revenue for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended August 3, 2025, respectively, and 64% and 63% for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended August 4, 2024, respectively. The increases were primarily due to higher software revenue mix and lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets as a percentage of revenue.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased $697 million, or 30%, and $920 million, or 13%, for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended August 3, 2025, respectively, compared to the prior year fiscal periods. The increases were primarily due to higher stock-based compensation.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $28 million, or 3%, and $845 million, or 21%, for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended August 3, 2025, respectively, compared to the prior year fiscal periods. The decreases were primarily due to lower compensation resulting from a decrease in headcount and lower VMware acquisition-related costs. The decrease in the fiscal quarter ende"
