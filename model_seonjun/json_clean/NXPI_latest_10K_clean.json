Our most important raw materials are the raw, or substrate, silicon wafers we use to make our semiconductors. We purchase these wafers, which must meet exacting specifications, from a limited number of suppliers in the geographic region in which our fabrication facilities are located. At our wholly owned fabrication plants, we use raw wafers ranging from 6 inches to 8 inches in size. Our SSMC wafer fab facility, which produces 8 inch wafers, is jointly owned by TSMC and ourselves. Emerging fabrication technologies employ larger wafer sizes and, accordingly, we expect that our production requirements will in the future shift towards larger substrate wafers.\nWe typically source our other raw materials in a similar fashion as our wafers, although our portfolio of suppliers is more diverse. Some of our suppliers provide us with materials on a just-in-time basis, which permits us to reduce our procurement costs and the negative cash flow consequences of maintaining inventories, but exposes us to potential supply chain interruptions. We purchase most of our raw materials on the basis of fixed price contracts.\nIn recent years, as a result of constraints in the semiconductor supply chains, there has been a tendency towards longer term supply contracts with suppliers in exchange for capacity. From an operational perspective, all of our manufacturing facilities continue to operate around the world in accordance with guidance issued by local and national government authorities.\nNXP also has equity investments in the following joint venture manufacturing companies:\nEuropean Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) GmbH will build and operate a new 300mm semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility in Dresden, Germany. ESMC is 70% owned by TSMC, with Bosch, Infineon, and NXP each owning 10%. NXP is entitled to 10% of the fab facility capacity. Initial production at ESMC is currently targeted to begin in 2027.\nVisionPower Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Pte. Ltd. (VSMC) will build and operate a new 300mm semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility in Singapore. VSMC is 60% owned by Vanguard International Semiconductor Corporation and 40% owned by NXP. NXP is entitled to 40% of the fab facility capacity. Initial production at VSMC is currently targeted to begin in 2027.\nSales, Marketing and Customers\nWe market our products and solutions worldwide to a variety of OEMs, Electronic Manufacturing Service customers (EMSs) and Distributors. We generate demand for our products by delivering product solutions to our customers, and supporting their system design-in activities by providing application architecture expertise and local field application engineering support.\nOur sales and marketing teams are organized into six regions, which are EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), the Americas, Japan, South Korea, China and South Asia Pacific. These sales regions are responsible for managing customer relationships and creating demand for our solutions through the full ecosystem development. In addition, our sales and marketing teams in the regions partner with our distributors and our large number of mass market customers.\nOur sales and marketing strategy focuses on key defined verticals in Automotive, Industrial & IoT, Communication Infrastructure, and Mobile deepening our relationship with our top OEMs and EMSs, expanding our reach to our mass market customers, startups and our distribution partners and becoming their preferred supplier, which we believe assists us in reducing sales volatility in challenging markets. We have long-standing customer relationships with most of our customers. Our 10 largest OEM end customers, some of whom are supplied by distributors, in alphabetical order, are Apple, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Harman Auto, Hyundai, LGE Automotive, Samsung and Visteon. We also have a strong position with our distribution partners, including our five largest in alphabetical order, Arrow, Avnet, Nexty, WT Micro and World Peace.\nOur revenue is primarily the sum of our direct sales to OEMs, EMSs plus our distributors’ resale of NXP products. Avnet accounted for 22% of our revenue in 2024 and 21% in 2023. No other distributor accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue. No OEM for which we had direct sales to accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2024 or 2023.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to both improve our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets. We direct our research and development efforts largely to the development of new semiconductor solutions where we see significant opportunities for growth. We target applications that require stringent overall system and subsystem performance. As new and challenging applications proliferate, we believe that many of these applications will benefit from our solutions. We have assembled a global team of highly skilled semiconductor and embedded software design engineers with expertise in RF, analog, power management, interface, security and digital processing.\nWith the intent to outpace market growth we invest in research and development to extend or create leading market positions, with an emphasis on fast growing sizable market segments, such as ADAS, in-vehicle networks and power management, as well as Edge computing to support the successful deployment in the IoT with our cross-over processing technology, but also in emerging markets, such as massive MIMO in RF Power and mmWave for 5G. In addition, we invest a few percent of our total research and development expenditures in research activities that develop fundamental new technologies or product categories that could contribute significantly to our company's growth in the future.\nWe annually perform a fundamental review of our business portfolio and our related new product and technology development opportunities in order to decide on changes in the allocation of our research and development resources. For products targeting established markets, we evaluate our research and development expenditures based on clear business need and risk assessments. For break-through technologies and new market opportunities, we look at the strategic fit and synergies with the rest of our portfolio and the size of the potential addressable market. Overall, we allocate our research and development to maintain a healthy mix of emerging growth and mature businesses.\nSubsidies and Grants\nWe receive subsidies and grants from governments in some countries in the form of direct grants as well as tax credits for R&D activities. Such funding is generally provided to encourage R&D activities, industrialization and local economic development and is generally available to all companies. The conditions for the receipt of government grants and subsidies may include eligibility restrictions, approval by relevant authorities, annual budget appropriations, compliance with relevant regulations or contingent return provisions, as well as specifications regarding objectives and results. The approval process for such funding may last up to several years. Certain specific contracts require compliance with extensive regulatory requirements and set forth certain conditions relating to the funded programs. There could be penalties if these objectives are not fulfilled.\nOur direct grants include those awarded under the European 2nd Important Project of Common European Interest on Microelectronics and Communication Technologies (“IPCEI ME/CT”). During 2023 and 2024, the Company was granted IPCEI ME/CT government assistance in multiple EU member states. The duration of the IPCEI ME/CT grants is planned to run until the end of 2029. The conditions to receive the IPCEI ME/CT government assistance include restrictions on eligible expenditures, employment retention, annual budget appropriations by the member states, compliance with member states’ regulations and project objectives and results, as well as repayment conditions. Our dedicated R&D teams across the involved member states under the IPCEI ME/CT program seek to innovate in core technologies across automotive, industrial and cybersecurity. This includes 5nm, advanced driving assistance and battery management systems in automotive, 6G and Ultra-Wideband as well as artificial intelligence (AI), RISC-V and post-quantum cryptography.\nIntellectual Property\nThe creation and use of intellectual property is a key aspect of our strategy to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by obtaining patents, trademarks, domain names, retaining trade secrets and defending, enforcing and utilizing our intellectual property rights, where appropriate. We believe this strategy allows us to preserve the advantages of our products and technologies, and helps us to improve the return on our investment in research and development. We have a broad portfolio of approximately 9,600 patent families (each patent family includes all patents and patent applications originating from the same invention). To protect confidential technical information and software, we rely on copyright and trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements as applicable. In situations where we believe that a third party has infringed on our intellectual property, we enforce our rights through all available legal means to the extent that we determine the benefits of such actions to outweigh the costs and risks involved.\nWe own a number of trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. Where we consider it desirable, we develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection. Our trademarks allow us to further distinguish our company and our products and are important in our relationships with customers, suppliers, partners and end-users.\nWhile our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights constitute valuable assets, we do not view any individual right or asset as material to our operations as a whole. We believe it is the combination of our proprietary technology, patents, know-how and other intellectual property rights and assets that creates an advantage for our business.\nIn addition to obtaining our own patents and other intellectual property rights, we have entered into licensing agreements and other arrangements authorizing us to use intellectual property rights, confidential technical\ninformation, software and other technology owned by third parties. We also engage, in certain instances, in licensing and selling of certain of our technology, patents and other intellectual property rights.\nWe compete with many different semiconductor companies on a global basis, including with both integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”) as well as fabless companies. Nearly all our competitors invest extensively in research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities across a broad spectrum of product lines. Many of our competitors are focused on single applications or market segments. Most of our competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our product lines.\nOur primary key public competitors in alphabetical order include, but are not limited to, Analog ",

Revenue through NXP’s third party direct OEM and EMS customers was $1,321 million, consistent with the previous period.\nFrom a geographic perspective, revenue increased in the Asia Pacific and China regions, partly offset by declines in the EMEA and the Americas regions.\nThe gross profit percentage for the fourth quarter of 2024 decreased to 53.9% from 57.4% in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to an impairment of capital assets and higher restructuring costs for specific targeted actions under the new global restructuring programs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nOperating cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was $391 million compared to $779 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, a decrease of $388 million or 50.2% quarter-on-quarter.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents the composition of operating income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\nResearch and development\nSelling, general and administrative\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nOther income (expense)\nOperating income (loss)\nFinancial income (expense)\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\nResults relating to equity-accounted investees\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to stockholders\nDiluted earnings per share\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $12,614 million compared to $13,276 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $662 million or 5.0% year-on-year.\nRevenue by end market was as follows:\n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\nCommunication Infrastructure & Other\nRevenue by sales channel was as follows:\n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\nOEM/EMS\nRevenue by geographic region, which is based on the customer’s shipped-to location, was as follows:\n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\nAPAC, excluding China\nEMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa)\nChina includes Mainland China and Hong Kong\nFrom an end market perspective, NXP experienced growth in its Mobile end market, which was offset by declines in the Communication Infrastructure & Other, Automotive and Industrial & IoT end markets versus the year ago period.\nRevenue in the Automotive end market was $7,151 million, a decrease of $333 million or 4.4% versus the year ago period, with processor and connectivity products contributing to the decline partly offset with growth in advanced analog and ADAS – Safety products.\nRevenue in the Industrial & IoT end market was $2,269 million, a decrease of $82 million or 3.5% versus the year ago period, with processor products contributing to the decline partly offset with growth in advanced analog and connectivity products.\nRevenue in the Mobile end market was $1,497 million, an increase of $170 million or 12.8% versus the year ago period, with mobile wallet products contributing to the growth.\nRevenue in the Communication Infrastructure & Other end market was $1,697 million, a decrease of $417 million or 19.7% versus the year ago period, with the entire product portfolio contributing the decline.\nWhen aggregating all end markets and reviewing sales channel performance, revenue through NXP’s third party distribution partners was $7,203 million, consistent with the year ago period with an increase of $8 million or 0.1%. Revenue through direct OEM and EMS customers was $5,291 million, a decrease of $672 million or 11.3% versus the year ago period.\nFrom a geographic perspective, revenue increased in the China region and declined in the EMEA, Americas, and Asia Pacific regions versus the year ago period.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $7,119 million, or 56.4% of revenue, compared to $7,553 million, or 56.9% of revenue, relatively consistent with revenue and costs, both of which had comparable decreases year on year, with 2024 experiencing a slightly lower year on year utilization.\n\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $3,647 million, or 28.9% of revenue, compared to $3,877 million, or 29.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development (R&D) costs primarily consist of engineer salaries and wages (including share based compensation and other variable compensation), engineering related costs (including outside services, fixed-asset, IP and other licenses related costs), shared service center costs and other pre-production related expenses.\n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\nResearch and development\nAs a percentage of revenue\nR&D costs for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased by $71 million, or 2.9%, when compared to last year primarily driven by lower bonus of $85 million and higher received government assistance due to subsidies and R&D tax credits of $60 million, partly offset by higher engineer salaries and wages of $25 million, higher share-based compensation costs of $22 million and higher licensing fees of $12 million.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs primarily consist of personnel salaries and wages (including share based compensation and other variable compensation), communication and IT related costs, fixed-asset related costs and sales and marketing costs (including travel expenses).\n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\nSelling, general and administrative\nAs a percentage of revenue\nSG&A costs for the year ended December 31, 2024 remained relatively flat, an increase of $5 million, or 0.4%, when compared to last year primarily driven by higher personnel salaries and wages, including social securities of $32 million, higher share-based compensation costs of $23 million and higher restructuring costs for specific targeted actions under global restructuring programs of $11 million, offset by lower bonus of $43 million and lower legal expenses of $26 million.\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n($ in millions, unless otherwise stated)\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nAs a percentage of revenue\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets decreased by $164 million, or 54.7%, when compared to last year mainly from the effect of certain acquisition-related intangibles becoming fully amortized (with regard to the previous Marvell and Freescale acquisitions).\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) includes results from manufacturing service arrangements (“MSA”) and transitional service arrangements (“TSA”) that are put into place when we divest a business or activity, as well as other activity. These arrangements are expected to decrease as the divested business or activity becomes more established. Other income (expense) reflects a loss of $55 million for 2024, compared to a loss of $15 million in 2023. Included in 2024 is a $40 million charge for a vacated deposit on an exited technology.\nFinancial Income (Expense)\nFor the years ended December 31,\nTotal other financial income (expense)\nFinancial income (expense) was an expense of $318 million in 2024, compared to an expense of $309 million in 2023. The change in financial income (expense) is attributable to a decrease in interest income of $27 million as a result of lower cash level in 2024, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest expense decreased by $40 million as a result of redemption of debt. Other financial expenses increased due to adjustments in our investments as well as interest related to prior tax positions.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $545 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which reflects an effective tax rate of 17.6% compared to an expense of $523 million (15.6%) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nStatutory income tax in the Netherlands\nRate differential local statutory rates versus statutory rate of the Netherlands\nNet change in valuation allowance\nNon-deductible expenses/losses\nNetherlands tax incentives\nForeign tax incentives\nChanges in estimates of prior years’ income taxes\nPillar 2 income taxes\nThe effective tax rate reflects the impact of tax incentives, a portion of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates different than the Netherlands statutory tax rate, changes in estimates of prior years' income taxes, change in valuation allowance non-deductible expenses and withholding taxes. The impact of these items results in offsetting factors that attribute to the change in the effective tax rate between the two periods, with the significant drivers outlined below:\nThe Company benefits from certain tax incentives, which reduce the effective tax rate. The dollar amount of the incentive in any given year is commensurate with the taxable income in that same period. In 2024, the foreign tax incentives are lower compared to 2023 primarily due to less qualifying income.\nAs from 2024 a new alternative minimum tax law is applicable in The Netherlands, which is based on the OECD global anti-base erosion model rules (also known as Pillar Two). In accordance with this law, NXP N.V. recorded an additional tax expense in 2024.\nThe higher favorable changes in estimates of prior years' income taxes in 2023 is primarily as a result of new guidance released by the Internal Revenue Service to clarify the treatment of specified research and experimental expenditures under Section 174.\nThe other differences are mainly relating to excess tax benefits, unrecognized tax benefits, FX-effects and taxes due on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusions in the U.S. GILTI is recognized as a current period expense when incurred.\nResults Relating to Equity-accounted Investees\nResults relating to equity-accounted investees amounted to a loss of $12 million in 2024, whereas in 2023 results relating to equity-accounted investees amounted to a loss of $7 million.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests are related to the third-party share in the resu",
