  "item1_clean": "Our insurance platform focuses on providing full investment management services for insurance and reinsurance accounts, seeking to deliver customized and diversified portfolios consisting primarily of investment grade credit, including through Blackstone’s private credit origination capabilities. Through this platform, we provide our clients tailored portfolio construction, strategic asset allocation, and specialized analytical tools. While focusing on policyholder protection, we seek to achieve risk-managed, liability-matched and capital-efficient returns, as well as diversification and capital preservation. We also provide similar services to clients through SMAs or by\nassets for certain insurance-dedicated funds and special purpose vehicles.\nMulti-Asset Investing\nOur Multi-Asset Investing segment (“BXMA”) has approximately 240 employees managing $84.2 billion of Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2024. BXMA, the world’s largest discretionary allocator to hedge funds, seeks to grow investors’ assets through investment strategies designed to deliver, primarily through the public markets, compelling risk-adjusted returns.\nBXMA is organized into two primary platforms: Absolute Return and Multi-Strategy. Absolute Return is designed to pursue consistent, efficient and diversifying returns across multiple market environments. Absolute Return manages a broad range of commingled and customized fund solutions, a seeding business and registered funds that provide alternative asset solutions through daily liquidity products. Multi-Strategy aims to generate strong risk-adjusted returns through opportunistic, asset-class agnostic investing, including structured risk transfer and equity capital markets strategies.\nBXMA also includes a platform managed by Harvest Fund Advisors LLC (“Harvest”), which primarily invests in publicly traded energy infrastructure, renewables and master limited partnerships holding midstream energy assets in North America.\nEach of our business segments currently includes Perpetual Capital assets under management, which refers to assets under management with an indefinite term, that are not in liquidation and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows or where required redemptions are limited in quantum. In recent years, we have continued to meaningfully increase our assets under management in such vehicles. Perpetual Capital strategies represent a significant and growing portion of our overall business, and the management fees and performance revenues we receive. Perpetual Capital strategies include, without limitation, (a) in our Real Estate segment, Core+ real estate (including BREIT and BEPIF) and BXMT, (b) in our Private Equity segment, BIP, BXPE, BXINFRA and vehicles in GP Stakes, and (c) in our Credit & Insurance segment, BXSL and BCRED. In addition, assets managed for certain of our insurance clients are Perpetual Capital assets under management.\nPrivate Wealth Strategy\nBlackstone’s business historically focused on the provision of investment products, such as traditional drawdown funds, to institutional investors. Blackstone’s business now also includes a substantial number of investment products that are offered through various distribution channels to certain\nand mass affluent individual investors in the U.S. and other jurisdictions around the world. We expect to continue to expand the number and type of such products that we offer. Our Private Wealth Solutions business is dedicated to building out our distribution capabilities in the private wealth channel to provide certain individual investors with access to Blackstone products across a broad array of alternative investment strategies. In recent years, capital from the private wealth channel has represented an increasing portion of our Total Assets Under Management, and we expect this trend to continue as we continue to undertake initiatives focused on this market segment.\n\nStrategic Partners is a total fund solutions provider. As a secondary investor, it acquires interests in high-quality private funds from original holders seeking liquidity. Strategic Partners focuses on a range of opportunities in underlying funds such as private equity, real estate, infrastructure, venture and growth capital, credit and other types of funds, as well as general\ntransactions and primary investments and\nwith financial sponsors. Strategic Partners also provides investment advisory services to separately managed account clients investing in primary and secondary investments in private funds and\nGP Stakes targets minority investments in the general partners of private equity and other private market alternative asset management firms globally, with a focus on delivering a combination of recurring annual cash flow yield and long-term capital appreciation.\nBIP targets a diversified mix of core+, core and public-private partnership investments across all infrastructure sectors, including energy infrastructure, transportation, digital infrastructure and water and waste. BIP applies a disciplined, operationally intensive investment approach to investments, seeking to apply a long-term\nstrategy to large-scale infrastructure assets with a focus on delivering stable, long-term capital appreciation together with a predictable annual cash flow yield.\nBXLS invests across the life cycle of companies and products within the life sciences sector. BXLS primarily focuses on investments in life sciences products in late-stage clinical development within the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical technology sectors.\nBXG seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in dynamic, growth-stage businesses, with a focus on the consumer, consumer technology, enterprise solutions, financial services and healthcare sectors.\nBXPE invests primarily in privately negotiated, equity-oriented investments, leveraging Blackstone’s private equity talent and investment capabilities to create an attractive portfolio of alternative investments diversified across geographies and sectors.\nBXINFRA invests primarily in infrastructure equity, secondaries and credit strategies, leveraging Blackstone’s infrastructure talent and investment capabilities to create an attractive portfolio of alternative infrastructure investments.\nOur Credit & Insurance segment (“BXCI”) has approximately 685 employees and manages $375.5 billion of Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2024. BXCI offers its clients and borrowers a comprehensive solution across corporate and asset based credit, including investment grade and\ngrade. BXCI is one of the largest credit managers and CLO managers in the world. The investment portfolios BXCI’s credit platform manages or\nconsist primarily of loans and securities of\nand investment grade companies spread across the capital structure including senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred stock and common equity.\nBXCI is organized into three overarching credit investing strategies: private corporate credit, liquid corporate credit and infrastructure and asset based credit. The private corporate credit strategies include mezzanine and direct lending funds, private placement strategies, stressed/distressed strategies and SMAs. The direct lending funds include Blackstone Private Credit Fund (“BCRED”) and Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (“BXSL”), both of which are business development companies (“BDCs”). The liquid corporate credit strategies consist of CLOs, closed-ended funds, open-ended funds, systematic strategies and SMAs. The infrastructure and asset based credit strategies include energy strategies (including our sustainable resources platform) and asset based finance strategies focused on privately originated, income-oriented credit assets secured by physical, financial or residential real estate collateral.\n\nThe asset management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. We compete both globally and on a regional, industry and sector basis. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including investment performance, transaction execution skills, access to capital, access to and retention of qualified personnel, reputation, range of products and services, innovation and price.\nWe face competition in the pursuit of institutional and individual investors for our investment funds. Although over time many institutional and individual investors have increased the amount of capital they commit to alternative investment funds, such increases may create increased competition with respect to fees charged by our funds. Certain institutional investors have demonstrated a preference to\ntheir own investment professionals and to make direct investments in alternative assets without the assistance of private equity advisers like us. We compete for investments with such institutional investors and such institutional investors could cease to be our clients. In the private wealth and insurance channels, the market for capital is highly competitive, requires significant investment and is highly regulated, which could create competitive challenges for us. In the private wealth channel, the willingness of our competitors to pay higher or differing types of distributor fees increases competition for fundraising.\nWe also face competition in the pursuit of attractive investment opportunities for our funds. Depending on the investment, we face competition primarily from sponsors managing other funds, investment vehicles and other pools of capital, other financial institutions and institutional investors (including sovereign wealth and pension funds), corporate buyers and other parties. Several of these competitors have significant amounts of capital and many of them have investment objectives similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources or other resources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments. Corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings with regard to an investment or be perceived by sellers as otherwise being more desirable bidders, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment.\nIn all of our businesses, competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.\nFor additional information concerning the competitive risks that we face, see “—Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — The asset management business is intensely competitive.”\n\nBlackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager. We seek to deliver compelling returns for institutional and individual investors by strengthening the companies and assets in which we invest. Our more than $1.1 trillion in Total Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2024 include global investment strategies focused on real estate, private equity, infrastructure, life sciences, growth equity, credit, real assets, secondaries and hedge funds.\nOur businesses use a solutions-oriented approach to drive better performance. We believe our scale, diversified business, long record of investment performance, rigorous investment process and strong client relationships position us to continue to perform well in a variety of market conditions, expand our assets under management, and innovate.\nWe invest across ass",
  "item7_clean": "For a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, see “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of Exhibit 99.1 of Blackstone’s Current Report on\nfiled on November 25, 2024.\nBlackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager. Our business is organized into four segments: Real Estate, Private Equity, Credit & Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing. For more information about our business segments, see “Part I. Item 1. Business — Business Segments.”\nWe generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies, and from capital markets services. We also invest in the funds we manage and we are entitled to a\nshare of the income of the fund (a\nallocation”). In addition to a\nallocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, we are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners, commonly referred to as carried interest (“Performance Allocations”). In certain structures, we receive a contractual incentive fee from an investment vehicle based on achieving certain investment returns (an “Incentive Fee,” and together with Performance Allocations, “Performance Revenues”). The composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. Net investment gains and investment income generated by the Blackstone Funds are driven by the performance of the underlying investments as well as overall market conditions. Fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of our portfolio companies and other investments, the industries in which they operate, the overall economy and other market conditions.\nBusiness Environment\nBlackstone’s businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world.\nGlobal markets experienced volatility in 2024, due to significant movement in Treasury yields, a strong U.S. Dollar, global geopolitical instability and macroeconomic uncertainty. The\nTreasury yield increased 86 basis points from the beginning of 2024 to an intraday high of 4.74% in April, declined 114 basis points to an intraday low of 3.6% in September, and subsequently rose again to end the year at 4.57%. Short-term rates decreased in 2024 with three-month SOFR down 103 basis points to 4.31%. The U.S. Dollar appreciated against major currencies in the fourth quarter and full year, including the Pound Sterling, Euro, Canadian Dollar, and Indian Rupee.\nMost major equity markets appreciated in the fourth quarter of 2024. The S&P 500 delivered a total return of 2.0% in the fourth quarter and 25.0% for the full year. All sectors gained during the year, led by the telecom sector, which rose 40.2%. In credit markets, the S&P leveraged loan index increased 9.0% in 2024 while the Credit Suisse high yield bond index rose 7.9%. High yield spreads tightened 57 basis points in 2024, while issuance increased 64% year-over-year. Base rates were volatile during the year. Equity market volatility increased, with the CBOE Volatility Index up 39% year-over-year. Oil prices were largely unchanged, with the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil up 0.1% in 2024 to $71.72 per barrel. The Henry Hub Natural Gas spot price increased 45% year-over-year to $3.63.\n\nNet Interest and Dividend Income (Loss) is presented on a segment basis and is equal to Interest and Dividend Revenue less Interest Expense, adjusted for the impact of consolidation of Blackstone Funds, and interest expense associated with the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nTaxes and Related Payables represent the total GAAP tax provision adjusted to include only the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes and including the Payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Further, the current tax provision utilized when calculating Taxes and Related Payables and Distributable Earnings reflects the benefit of deductions available to the company on certain expense items that are excluded from the underlying calculation of Segment Distributable Earnings and Total Segment Distributable Earnings, such as equity-based compensation charges and certain Transaction-Related and\nItems where there is a current tax provision or benefit. The economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are the same as those methodologies and assumptions used in calculating the current income tax provision for Blackstone’s Consolidated Statements of Operations under GAAP, excluding the impact of divestitures and accrued tax contingencies and refunds which are reflected when paid or received. Management believes that including the amount payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement and utilizing the current income tax provision adjusted as described above when calculating Distributable Earnings is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects earnings that are available for distribution to stockholders.\nSegment Distributable Earnings\nSegment Distributable Earnings is Blackstone’s segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across Blackstone’s four segments. Blackstone believes it is useful to stockholders to review the measure that management uses in assessing segment performance. Segment Distributable Earnings represents the net realized earnings of Blackstone’s segments and is the sum of Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations for each segment. Blackstone’s segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates Blackstone Funds, eliminates\nownership interests in Blackstone’s consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes Transaction-Related and\nItems. Transaction-Related and\nItems arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and\ngains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and\ngains, losses or other charges that affect\ncomparability and are not reflective of Blackstone’s operational performance. Segment Distributable Earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See “—\nFinancial Measures” for our reconciliation of Segment Distributable Earnings.\nNet Realizations is presented on a segment basis and is the sum of Realized Principal Investment Income and Realized Performance Revenues (which refers to Realized Performance Revenues excluding Fee Related Performance Revenues), less Realized Performance Compensation (which refers to Realized Performance Compensation excluding Fee Related Performance Compensation and Equity-Based Performance Compensation).\nRealized Performance Compensation reflects an increase in the aggregate Realized Performance Compensation paid to certain of our professionals above the amounts allocable to them based upon the percentage participation in the relevant performance plans previously awarded to them. In the year ended December 31, 2024, Realized Performance Compensation increased by an aggregate of $83.1 million and Fee Related Compensation decreased by a corresponding amount. In the year ended December 31, 2023, Realized Performance Compensation increased by an aggregate of $65.0 million and Fee Related Compensation decreased by a corresponding amount. These changes to Realized Performance Compensation and Fee Related Compensation reduced Net Realizations, increased Fee Related Earnings and had a neutral impact to Income Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes and Distributable Earnings in the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nSegment Distributable Earnings were $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $127.5 million, compared to $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to decreases of $113.3 million in Fee Related Earnings and $14.2 million in Net Realizations.\nThe performance of funds in our Real Estate segment in 2024 was negatively impacted by volatility in the\nTreasury yield, including a sharp increase in the fourth quarter, and a strong U.S. dollar. However, we believe a commercial real estate recovery is underway. Although the pace of such recovery is uncertain, the underpinnings are firmly in place, including a healthy economic backdrop that supports cash flow growth, meaningful improvements in the cost and availability of capital and a material decrease in construction starts. Subject to inflation subsiding, this should set the stage for a multi-year recovery. The constraints on future new supply, including in certain sectors in which our global opportunistic and Core+ real estate portfolios are concentrated, such as logistics and rental housing, should also support real estate values over time.\nWe additionally continue to believe that, despite recent speculation about data center demand, there will continue to be significant demand for digital infrastructure as artificial intelligence and other technological innovation is increasingly adopted and developed. Our Real Estate segment is well positioned to benefit from this trend. In certain markets and sectors with elevated near-term supply, including U.S. logistics and multifamily, however, growth has slowed and may moderate further. Life science office and traditional office valuations have also been negatively impacted by challenging sector dynamics and capital markets. While our NYSE-listed REIT, Blackstone Mortgage Trust (“BXMT”), is mostly focused in sectors with strong long-term fundamentals, its office exposure is higher than in our real estate equity business. Although this has posed challenges for the vehicle, its office exposure has been meaningfully reduced through loan resolutions and repayments. Given our conviction that a recovery is underway, our Real Estate funds deployed $25.3 billion in 2024, a nearly 70% increase year over year. While we expect our real estate realization activity to remain muted as commercial real estate continues to recover, we believe the market for realizations will strengthen over time. In BREIT, improving investor sentiment throughout 2024 has contributed to favorable trends in net flows, with a 97% decline in net repurchase requests in December 2024 relative to their peak in January 2023.\nFee Related Earnings\nFee Related Earnings were $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $113.3 million, compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease of $90.8 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues and an increase of $55.3 million in Other Operating Expenses, partially offset by an increase of $31.9 million in Management Fees, Net.\nFee Related Performance Revenues were $203.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $90.8 million, compared to $294.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower Fee Related Performance Revenues in BPP and\nOther Operating Expenses were $380.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $55.3 million, compared to $325.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher\nfees and professional fees.\nManagement Fees, Net were $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $31.9 million, compared to $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in Transaction and Other Fees, Net, partially offset by a decrease in Base Management Fees. Transaction and Other Fees, Net increased $96.5 million primarily due to an increase in acquisition fees paid to the advisor of our BREP funds. Base Management Fees decreased $77.2 million primarily due to a decrease in\nAssets Under Management in BREIT.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nSegment Distributable Earnings were $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $744.9 million, compared to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to an increase of $769.5 million in Fee Related Earnings, partially offset by a decrease of $24.6 million in Net Realizations.\nOur Private Equity segment demonstrated resilience across all strategies in 2024. In addition to particular strength in Corporate Private Equity and Life Sciences, our Infrastructure business was a notable driver of Fee Related Performance Revenues in the fourth quarter due to a significant scheduled crystallization event. We continue to believe our Infrastructure business is well positioned to benefit from the expected increase in demand for investment in infrastructure, including digital infrastructure, over time. In Corporate Private Equity, our operating companies saw stable revenue growth and margin expansion during the year. Realization activity in the segment meaningfully increased toward the end of 2024, concentrated in Corporate Private Equity, and we see a more constructive environment for realizations in the segment through the course of 2025. Improved market sentiment has created positive momentum for deployment in the segment, which nearly doubled year-over-year, and for fundraising, including in our perpetual capital strategies.\nFee Related Earnings\nFee Related Earnings were $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $769.5 million, compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $1.2 billion in Fee Related Performance Revenues and $190.7 million in Management and Advisory Fees, Net, partially offset by an increase of $544.6 million in Fee Related Compensation.\n\nFee Related Performance Revenues were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $1.2 billion, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to crystallization of performance revenues in BIP and BXPE.\nManagement and Advisory Fees, Net were $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $190.7 million, compared to $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by increases in Base Management Fees and Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net. Base Management Fees increased $123.9 million primarily due to an increase in\nAssets Under Management in BIP and BXPE, as well as the investment period commencement and subsequent fee holiday expirations of BCP IX and BETP IV. Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net increased $67.6 million primarily due to increased volume of deal activity in BXCM.\nFee Related Compensation were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $544.6 million, compared to $619.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in Fee Related Performance Revenues and Management and Advisory Fees, Net, both of which impact Fee Related Compensation.\nNet Realizations were $811.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $24.6 million, compared to $835.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Net Realizations was attributable to an incre",
