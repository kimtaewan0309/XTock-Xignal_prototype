It is the Company's competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders. The ITW Business Model is comprised of three unique elements:\nprocess is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company and its customers. Through the application of data driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the \"80\") and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the \"20\"). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;\nCustomer-back Innovation\nhas fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company's unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 Front-to-Back process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their \"80\" customers. ITW's innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in \"80\" markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 20,900 granted and pending patents;\nDecentralized, Entrepreneurial Culture\nenables ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. ITW colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the Company's strategy and values. As a result, the Company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services and solutions adapted to each business' customers and end markets.\nENTERPRISE STRATEGY: 2012 - 2023\nIn late 2012, ITW began its strategic framework transitioning the Company to fully leverage the unique and powerful set of capabilities and operating practices of the ITW Business Model. The Company undertook a complete review of its performance, focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations. ITW determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders.\nKey initiatives in the Company's enterprise strategy included portfolio management, business structure simplification, strategic sourcing and the diligent re-application of ITW's proprietary 80/20 Front-to-Back process.\nAs part of the Portfolio Management initiative, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions.\nBusiness Structure Simplification was implemented to simplify and scale up ITW's operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. ITW now has 86 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.\nThe Strategic Sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at ITW, delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year since 2013 and continues to be a key contributor to the Company's ongoing enterprise strategy.\nWith the initial portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely completed, the Company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth, reapplying the 80/20 Front-to-Back process to optimize its scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.\nSince implementing the Company's enterprise strategy in 2012, the Company has demonstrated the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model and superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company's operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. At the same time, these 80/20 initiatives may also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.\nOUR NEXT PHASE: 2024 - 2030\nIn the Next Phase of the Company’s evolution, the ITW Business Model and the Enterprise Strategy framework will be as formidable of a competitive advantage and performance differentiator as it has been over the last decade, if not more so. Volatility, risk and the pace of change in the global operating environment will continue to increase, and a decentralized entrepreneurial culture allows the Company to be a fast adaptor – to read, react, respond and evolve. The Company’s ability to consistently execute and invest through the ups and downs of the business cycle is now a defining competitive advantage.\nThroughout the Next Phase, the Company's focus is to build organic growth into a core ITW strength on par with the Company’s world-class financial performance and operational capabilities. Throughout this phase, the Company",

In the short-term, PLS may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. In the long-term, PLS is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns.\nUnless otherwise stated, the changes in financial results in the consolidated results of operations and the results of operations by segment represent the current year period versus the comparable period in the prior year.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the United States and several other countries imposed economic and other sanctions on Russia. The Company has four immaterial Russian subsidiaries with total assets of approximately $22 million as of December 31, 2024. The revenue for these four subsidiaries for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was approximately $24 million. These subsidiaries were not material to the Company's results of operations or financial position.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest two businesses, including one business in the Polymers & Fluids segment and one business in the Food Equipment segment. These two businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, both of these businesses were divested. On October 3, 2022, the business in the Polymers & Fluids segment was sold for $220 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $156 million. On December 1, 2022, the business in the Food Equipment segment was sold for $59 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $41 million. The pre-tax gains were included in Other income (expense) in the Statement of Income. Income taxes on the gains were mostly offset by the utilization of capital loss carryforwards of $32 million. Operating revenue related to these divested businesses that was included in the Company's results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was $106 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, plans were approved to divest one business in the Specialty Products segment. This business was presented as held for sale beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. This business was sold on April 3, 2023, with no significant gain or loss upon sale. Operating revenue related to this business that was included in the Company's results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $9 million and $37 million, respectively. Refer to Note 3. Divestitures in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding the Company's divestitures.\nOn January 2, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of one business in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment for $57 million, net of cash acquired. On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of one business in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment for $59 million, net of cash acquired. The purchase price for both acquisitions was subject to certain closing adjustments. These acquisitions were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The allocation of purchase price for these acquisitions will be completed as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2.\nAcquisitions in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding the Company's acquisitions.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company changed the method used to determine the cost of inventory at certain U.S. businesses from the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method to the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method, as the Company believes the FIFO method is preferable because it provides a more consistent method for valuing inventory across the Company’s operations, improves comparability with peers, and better reflects the current value of inventories at the balance sheet date. The LIFO provision for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $6 million of expense and $7 million of income, respectively, and was not material to the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Therefore, the Company recorded the pre-tax cumulative effect of this change in accounting method of $117 million as a reduction of Cost of revenue in the first quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding this change in accounting method and the Company’s inventory balances.\nOn August 5, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with affiliates of CD&R for the sale of the Company’s noncontrolling equity interest in Wilsonart. The transaction closed immediately after the execution of the purchase agreement. Proceeds from the transaction, net of transaction costs, were $395 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $363 million which was included in Other income (expense) in the Statement of Income. Income taxes on the gain were more than offset by a discrete tax benefit of $107 million in the third quarter of 2024 related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards upon the sale of Wilsonart. The sale of the Company’s equity interest in Wilsonart is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results in subsequent periods. Refer to Note 5. Other Income (Expense) and Note 6. Income Taxes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding this transaction.\nIn a challenging and dynamic environment, the Company delivered solid financial results in 2024 primarily due to the continued successful execution of enterprise initiatives and continued focus on the highly differentiated ITW Business Model.\nRefer to the \"Results of Operations for Total Company\" and the \"Results of Operations by Segment\" sections for discussion of changes in operating revenue for 2024 compared to 2023 and 2023 compared to 2022.\nPercent of operating revenue\nSelling, administrative, and research and development expenses\nPercent of operating revenue\nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets\nPercent of operating revenue\nCost of revenue was $8.9 billion in 2024, $9.3 billion in 2023 and $9.4 billion in 2022. Cost of revenue was 4.9% lower in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower revenue and the first quarter 2024 LIFO accounting method change, which reduced cost of revenue by 3.1% and 1.3%, respectively. Cost of revenue as a percent of operating revenue improved in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the LIFO accounting method change and benefits from the Company's enterprise initiatives, partially offset by higher employee-related expenses. Cost of revenue was 1.2% lower in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the impact of divestiture activity in the second quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, which reduced cost of revenue by 1.0%.

Expenses in 2024 increased 1.4% compared to 2023 primarily driven by higher employee-related expenses and the impact of acquisitions in 2024. Selling, administrative, and research and development expenses as a percent of operating revenue were higher in 2024 compared to 2023, as higher employee-related expenses and the unfavorable impact of acquisitions in the first and second quarters of 2024 were partially offset by benefits from the Company's enterprise initiatives. Expenses in 2023 increased 2.3% compared to 2022 driven by a 3.0% increase resulting from higher organic revenue, partially offset by the impact of divestiture activity which reduced expenses by 0.7%. Selling, administrative, and research and development expenses as a percent of operating revenue were slightly higher in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher employee-related expenses and research and development expenses, partially offset by positive operating leverage and benefits from the Company's enterprise initiatives.\nAmortization and impairment of intangible assets was $101 million in 2024, $113 million in 2023 and $134 million in 2022.
