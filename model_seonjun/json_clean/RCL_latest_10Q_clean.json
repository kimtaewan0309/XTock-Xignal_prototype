Demand has historically been strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have historically focused on deployment to the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period.\nFinancial Presentation\nDescription of Certain Line Items\nOur revenues are comprised of the following:\nPassenger ticket revenues\n, which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air\n\nrepresents Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.\nis a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA (as defined below) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful whe\nn assessing our profitability on a comparative basis. For the periods presented\n, these items included (i) other expense (income), (ii) equity investment impairment, recovery of losses, and other, (iii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses, and (iv) impairment losses.\nA reconciliation of Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nrepresents Gross Margin, adjusted for payroll and related, food, fuel, other operating, and depreciation and amortization expense. Gross Margin is calculated pursuant to GAAP as total revenues less total cruise operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\nis a non-GAAP measure that represents Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included (i) loss on extinguishment of debt and inducement expense, (ii) the amortization of the Silversea intangible assets resulting from the Silversea acquisition, (iii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses, (iv) equity investments impairment, recovery of losses, and other, (v) impairment losses, (vi) gain on sale of noncontrolling interest, and (vii) tax on the sale of PortMiami noncontrolling interest. A reconciliation of Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is provided below under Results of Operations.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nrepresents operating income including income from equity investments and income taxes but excluding certain items for which we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. We use this non-GAAP measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below).\nAvailable Passenger Cruise Days\n“APCD”\n) is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary.\nConstant Currency is a significant measure for our revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, the value of these revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollar will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses, it can be an important element. For this reason, we also monitor our revenues and expenses in \"Constant Currency\" - i.e., as if the current period's currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period's rates. For the 2025 period presented, we calculate \"Constant Currency\" by applying the average for 2024 period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months, so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods. We do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods. It should be emphasized that the use of Constant Currency is primarily used by us for comparing short-term changes and/or projections. Over the longer term, changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency-based fluctuations.\nEBITDA\nis a non-GAAP measure that represents Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. A reconciliation of Net\nIncome attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. t\no EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations.\nrepresent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses.\nrepresent Gross Margin per APCD.\nrepresents the most recent five-quarter average of total debt (i.e., Current portion of long-term debt plus Long-term debt) plus the most recent five-quarter average of Total shareholders' equity. We use this measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below).\nruise Costs Excluding Fuel\nare non-GAAP measures that represent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses, and onboard and other expenses and, in the case of Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel, fuel expenses (each of which is described above under the Description of Certain Line Items heading). In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.\nA reconciliation of Gross Cruise Costs to Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel is provided below under Results of Operations.\nFor the periods presented, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel excludes\n(i) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses, and (ii) impairment losses\nrepresent Adjusted Gross Margin per APCD. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin and Net Yields to manage our business on a day-to-day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs, which are commissions, transportation and other expenses, and onboard and other expenses.\nOccupancy (\"Load factor\")\n, in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days (as defined below) by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.\nPassenger Cruise Days (\"PCD\")\nrepresent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.\nrefers to the multi-year Adjusted EPS and ROIC goals we are seeking to achieve by end of 2027. Under our Perfecta Program, we are targeting 20% compound annual growth rate in Adjusted EPS compared to 2024 and ROIC of 17% or higher by the end of 2027.\nReturn on Invested Capital (\"ROIC\")\nrepresents Adjusted Operating Income divided by Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.\nThe use of certain significant n\non-GAAP measures, such as Net Yields, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel, allows us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard GAAP based financial measures. There are no specific rules or regulations for determining non-GAAP measures, and as such, they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry.\nResults of Operations\n\nNet Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for the third quarter of 2025 was $1.6 billion, respectively, compared to Net Income and Adjusted Net Income of $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024.\nNet Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $3.5 billion, respectively, compared to Net Income and Adjusted Net Income of $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, for the nine months end"
