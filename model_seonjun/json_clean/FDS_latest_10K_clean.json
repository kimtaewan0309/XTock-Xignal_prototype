This approach allows us to better manage resources, target solutions and interact with clients effectively.\nTo execute our strategy, we are focused on three core pillars and primary areas of investment:\nExpanding our data offerings and delivery capabilities:\nWe continue to scale up our data ecosystem to provide a comprehensive inventory of industry, proprietary and third-party data. This includes granular data for key industry verticals, real-time market data, fund data and sustainable finance. In addition to using our growing data catalog to drive our AI-powered workstation products, we aim to continue to expand our data delivery capabilities in the cloud and through other methods to advance our position as an enterprise data provider for our clients.\nEmbedding deeper in client workflows:\nThrough continued innovation, we aim to deepen our integration into our clients' workflows.

These outcomes accelerate decision making for our clients and will differentiate FactSet from our competitors and drive growth.\nExecutive Leadership Transition\nOn September 8, 2025, Sanoke Viswanathan assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer and joined FactSet’s Board of Directors. Mr. Viswanathan succeeds F. Philip Snow, who retired from these roles effective on Mr. Viswanathan's start date. To support a smooth leadership transition, Mr. Snow is continuing employment with FactSet in an advisory capacity until December 31, 2025.\nRevenues and Annual Subscription Value (\"ASV\")\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from client access to our multi-asset solutions powered by our platform of connected data and technology that is available over the contractual term. We offer expansive data, sophisticated analytics, and flexible technology through our platform.\nWe believe ASV reflects our ability to grow recurring revenues and generate positive cash flows, and thus serves as a key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy. ASV at any point in time represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients. Organic ASV at any point in time represents ASV excluding ASV from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency movements.\nFactSet Clients and Users\nWe had 8,996 clients and 237,324 professionals using FactSet as of August 31, 2025. Our client count includes clients with ASV of $10,000 and above and our user count does not reflect users associated with our fiscal 2025 acquisitions. For the year ended August 31, 2025, annual ASV retention was greater than 95% and, when expressed as a percentage of clients, annual retention was 91%.\nBuy-side clients continue to shift toward multi-asset class investment strategies and investing in their front- and middle office solutions, where we are well-positioned to be a partner of choice.

  "item7_clean": "Related to a resolved matter with the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. Refer to Note 12,\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAdjusted operating margin is calculated as Adjusted operating income divided by Revenues.\nFor purposes of calculating Adjusted net income and Adjusted Diluted EPS, all adjustments were taxed at an adjusted tax rate of 26.0% and 26.5% for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of August 31, 2025, Cash and cash equivalents were $337.7 million and restricted cash was $14.0 million, compared with Cash and cash equivalents of $423.0 million as of August 31, 2024. Refer to\nSummary of Cash Flows\nwithin this section below, for more information on cash flows during fiscal 2025 and 2024. Our Cash and cash equivalents as of August 31, 2025 are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with $169.8 million in EMEA (with the largest balance held in the UK), $106.1 million in the Americas and the remaining $61.8 million in Asia Pacific (with the largest balance held in the Philippines).\n, we had $486.9 million of undistributed foreign earnings of which $69.1 million are permanently reinvested. It is our intent to permanently reinvest all foreign undistributed earnings, except in jurisdictions where earnings can be repatriated substantially free of tax. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability that would be payable if these earnings were repatriated to the U.S.\nOur cash flows provided by operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, supplemented with our debt borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of our remaining available cash flows have been used to, among other things, service our existing and future debt obligations, satisfy our working capital requirements and fund various activities, including our capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our sources of liquidity, including the available capacity under our existing revolving credit facility and other financing alternatives, will provide us the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. We are exposed to credit risk for our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash held in financial institutions in the event of a default, to the extent that such amounts are in excess of applicable insurance limits; however, we do not believe our concentration of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presents a significant credit risk as the counterparties to the instruments consist of multiple high-quality, credit-worthy financial institutions.\nSources of Liquidity\nDebt and Swap Agreements\n2025 Credit Agreement\nOn April 8, 2025, we entered into a credit agreement (the \"2025 Credit Agreement\") and borrowed $500.0 million under a senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the \"2025 Term Facility\"). We used the proceeds from the 2025 Term Facility borrowing to repay the outstanding balance under the 2022 Revolving Facility (as defined below). The 2025 Credit Agreement also provides for a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"2025 Revolving Facility\"). The 2025 Revolving Facility, together with the 2025 Term Facility, are referred to as the \"2025 Credit Facilities\".\nThe 2025 Term Facility matures on April 8, 2028, and the 2025 Revolving Facility matures on April 8, 2030. The 2025 Revolving Facility provides for up to $100.0 million in the form of letters of credit and up to $100.0 million in the form of swingline loans. We may seek additional commitments of up to $1.0 billion under the 2025 Revolving Facility from lenders or other financial institutions.\nThe 2025 Term Facility is subject to scheduled quarterly principal payments, commencing on August 31, 2025, with each quarterly principal payment equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount of the 2025 Term Facility. The 2025 Credit Facilities are not otherwise subject to any other mandatory repayments. We may voluntarily prepay loans under the 2025 Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty. Prepayments of the 2025 Term Facility shall be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled quarterly principal payments in direct order of maturity.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we repaid $125.0 million under the 2025 Term Facility. This included $68.8 million to satisfy all scheduled quarterly principal payments from loan inception through maturity, eliminating any future mandatory quarterly principal payment requirements. The remaining $56.2 million was made as a voluntary prepayment. From the effective date of the 2025 Revolving Facility through August 31, 2025, we have had no borrowings under the 2025 Revolving Facility.\nFrom the borrowing date through August 31, 2025, the outstanding borrowings under the 2025 Credit Facilities bore interest at a rate equal to the applicable one-month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus a 0.975% spread (comprised of a 0.875% interest rate margin, based on a pricing grid determined by reference to our senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term debt rating and our total leverage ratio, plus a 0.1% credit spread adjustment).\nWe pay a commitment fee on the daily unused amount of the 2025 Revolving Facility using a pricing grid based on our senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term debt rating and our total leverage ratio. The commitment fee remained consistent at 0.1% through August 31, 2025.\nDebt issuance costs related to the 2025 Credit Facilities were $3.4 million. These debt issuance costs are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability for the 2025 Term Facility and within Other assets for the 2025 Revolving Facility. Debt issuance costs are amortized to Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the debt (which approximates the effective interest method for the 2025 Term Facility).\nThe 2025 Credit Agreement contains usual and customary event of default provisions for facilities of this type, which are subject to usual and customary grace periods and materiality thresholds. If an event of default occurs under the 2025 Credit Agreement, the lenders may, among other things, terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable.\nThe 2025 Credit Agreement contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of this type, including a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a total leverage ratio of no greater than 3.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (subject to an increase to 4.25 to 1.00 for five consecutive fiscal quarters in connection with certain material acquisitions). We were in compliance with all covenants and requirements of the 2025 Credit Agreement as of August 31, 2025.\n2022 Credit Agreement\nOn March 1, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the \"2022 Credit Agreement\") and borrowed $1.0 billion under a senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the \"2022 Term Facility\") and $250.0 million of the available $500.0 million under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"2022 Revolving Facility\"). The 2022 Revolving Facility, together with the 2022 Term Facility, are referred to as the \"2022 Credit Facilities\". On January 31, 2025, we entered into a joinder agreement to our 2022 Credit Agreement pursuant to which commitments under the 2022 Revolving Facility were increased by $100.0 million, to a total of $600.0 million. All other terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement remained unchanged.\nThe 2022 Term Facility, originally due to mature on March 1, 2025, was repaid in full following $125.0 million of repayments made during the six months ended February 28, 2025. During fiscal 2025, we borrowed $305.0 million and repaid $555.0 million under the 2022 Revolving Facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement was terminated on April 8, 2025, concurrent with entering into the 2025 Credit Agreement.\nBorrowings previously outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facilities bore interest at a rate equal to the applicable one-month Term SOFR plus a spread, using a debt leverage pricing grid and a credit spread adjustment (with total spread ranging from 0.975% to 1.1% over the term of the debt).\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nWe leverage interest rate swap agreements to manage our floating interest rate exposure with a fixed interest rate. Our interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges at inception.\nOn April 24, 2025, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (\"2025 Swap Agreement\") with a notional amount of $200.0 million to hedge a portion of our outstanding floating SOFR debt with a fixed interest rate of 4.086%. The notional amount of the 2025 Swap Agreement declines by $50.0 million on a quarterly basis beginning May 31, 2025 and matures on February 28, 2026. As of August 31, 2025, the notional amount of the 2025 Swap Agreement was $100.0 million.\nOn March 1, 2024, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (\"2024 Swap Agreement\") with a notional amount of $200.0 million to hedge a portion of our outstanding floating SOFR debt with a fixed interest rate of 5.145%. The notional amount of the 2024 Swap Agreement declined by $50.0 million on a quarterly basis beginning May 31, 2024. The 2024 Swap Agreement matured on February 28, 2025.\nOn March 1, 2022, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (\"2022 Swap Agreement\") with a notional amount of $800.0 million to hedge a portion of our outstanding floating SOFR debt with a fixed interest rate of 1.162%. The notional amount of the 2022 Swap Agreement declined by $100.0 million on a quarterly basis beginning May 31, 2022. The 2022 Swap Agreement matured on February 28, 2024.\nRefer to Part II, Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOn March 1, 2022, we completed a public offering issuing $500.0 million of 2.900% Senior Notes due March 1, 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\") and $500.0 million of 3.450% Senior Notes due March 1, 2032 (the \"2032 Notes\" and, together with the 2027 Notes, the \"Senior Notes\"). The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 1, 2022, by and between us and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the \"Trustee\"), as supplemented by the supplemental indenture, dated as of March 1, 2022, between us and the Trustee (the \"Supplemental Indenture\").\nThe Senior Notes were issued at an aggregate discount of $2.8 million and we incurred approximately $9.1 million in debt issuance costs during fiscal 2022. Debt discounts and debt issuance costs are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a net direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. The debt discounts and debt issuance costs are amortized to Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the contractual term of the debt, leveraging the effective interest method.\nInterest on the Senior Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year.\nWe may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at specified redemption prices, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture), we must offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\nReturning Value to Stockholders\nWe returned $460.4 million and $385.9 million to our stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends during fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nShare Repurchase Program\nWe may repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program from time-to-time in the open market or via privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 684,960 shares for $300.5 million and 537,800 shares for $235.2 million, respectively.\nThere is no defined number of shares to be repurchased over a specified timeframe through the life of our share repurchase program. On September 17, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $300 million in aggregate, which was available during fiscal 2025. This authorization expired upon the conclusion of fiscal 2025 and was not available for share repurchases after that date.\nOn June 17, 2025, our Board of Directors authorized up to $400 million for share repurchases on or after September 1, 2025 through September 30, 2026.\nRefer to Part III, Item 12,\nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\nDuring fiscal 2025 and 2024, we paid dividends of $160.0 million and $150.7 million, respectively. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, our Board of Directors approved a 6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $1.04 to $1.10 per share. Fiscal 2025 marked the 26th consecutive fiscal year we have increased dividends on a stock split-adjusted basis, highlighting our continued commitment to returning value to our stockholders. Future cash dividend payments are subject to final determination by our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other relevant factors.\nCapital Expenditures\nFor the year ended August 31, 2025, capital expenditures increased by 27.0% to $108.8 million, compared with $85.7 million in fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily due to higher capitalized costs related to the development of our internal-use software.\nOur acquisitions with the most significant cash flows from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2025 included Liquid Holdings, LLC (\"LiquidityBook\") and Platform Group Limited (\"Irwin\"). Refer to Part II, Item 8. Note 5,\nOn February 7, 2025 we completed the acquisition of LiquidityBook for a purchase price of $243.2 million, net of cash acquired, and inclusive of preliminary working capital adjustments. The purchase price includes contingent consideration of $11.9 million, which reflects the acquisition date fair value of potential future payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain specified milestones.\nLiquidityBook provides cloud-native trading solutions to hedge fund, asset and wealth management, outsourced trading, and sell-side middle office clients. LiquidityBook operates a proprietary FIX network that enables streamlined connectivity to over 200 brokers and order routing to more than 1,600 destinations across 80 markets globally. This acquisition adds technology-forward order management and investment book of record capabilities and enhances FactSet’s ability to serve the integrated workflow needs of clients across the portfolio life cycle.\nOn November 5, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Irwin for a purchase price of $120.2 million, net of cash acquired, and inclusive of working capital adjustments. The purchase price includes contingent consideration of $9.6 million, which reflects the acquisition date fair value of potential future payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain specified milestones. We finalized the purchase accounting for the Irwin acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal 2025.\nIrwin is a leading investor relations and capital markets platform for public companies and their advisors. This acquisition builds on a recent successful partnership between FactSet and Irwin, and expands our ability to address the holistic workflow needs of investor relations professionals with an integrated, modern solution.\nContractual Obligations\nPurchase obligations represent our legally-binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities at determinable prices.
