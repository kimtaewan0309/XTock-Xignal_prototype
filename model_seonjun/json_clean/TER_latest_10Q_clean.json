A few customers drive significant demand for our products both through direct sales and sales to the customer’s supply partners. We expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.\nArtificial Intelligence applications and data center power demand drove strong third quarter performance with our customers accelerating development and ramping production for a wide range of devices. We expect this acceleration to continue and even expand into the fourth quarter and into 2026 and are currently investing in sales, engineering, and support to pursue these, and additional, market opportunities in Semiconductor Test. Robotics revenue in the third quarter was flat with second quarter sales due to ongoing business environment challenges. Our focus in the Robotics segment remains on operating expense management and our channel transformation strategy as we transition toward serving large direct customers and building a Robotics organization that can grow profitably over the mid-term.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, we entered into a credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") providing a three-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of $400.0 million. On December 10, 2021, the Credit Agreement was amended to extend the senior secured revolving credit facility to December 10, 2026. On October 5, 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended to increase the amount of the credit facility to $750.0 million from $400.0 million. On November 7, 2023, the Credit Agreement was amended to allow for the purchase of the shares of Technoprobe. On September 4, 2025, and September 19, 2025, we borrowed a combined $200.0 million under the Credit Agreement to fund out capital allocation strategy. As of October 30, 2025, there is $250.0 million outstanding from the Credit Facility.\nWe believe our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings. As of September 28, 2025, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nEquity Compensation Plans\n\nDuring the three months ended September 28, 2025, we recorded $4.8 million of severance charges, $3.6 million of which is related to headcount reductions in Robotics. During the three months ended September 28, 2025, we made $1.1 million of Robotics severance payments. We expect all Robotics severance payments to be made prior to the end of the third quarter of 2026.\nDuring the three months ended September 29, 2024, we recorded restructuring and other charges primarily related to $1.3 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions principally in Robotics.\n\nThe decrease in operating assets was primarily due to decreases in other assets and inventory of $61.4 million and $11.1 million,\nrespectively, partially offset by a $65.3 million increase in accounts receivable, driven by higher sales in the third quarter.\nThe decrease in operating liabilities was due to a $32.3 million decrease in accrued employee compensation, $25.9 million\ndecrease in accounts payable, $18.9 million decrease in income taxes, $4.2 million decrease in retirement plans, and $5.5 million\ndecrease in accrued other, partially offset by a $3.6 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advances.\nInvesting activities during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, used cash of $554.9 million due to $527.1 million used\nfor the purchases of investment, $140.7 million used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, $35.1 million used for the\npurchase of marketable securities, partially offset by $90.3 million in proceeds from the sale of a business, $23.6 million and $33.2\nmillion in proceeds from the sales and maturities and marketable securities, respectively, and $0.9 million in proceeds from life\n\nWe are a leading global provider of automated test equipment and robotics products. Our automated test systems are used to test semiconductors, wireless products, data storage, silicon photonics, and complex electronics systems in many industries including consumer electronics, wireless, automotive, industrial, computing, communications, and aerospace and defense industries. Our robotics product offerings consist primarily of collaborative robotic arms and autonomous mobile robots used by global manufacturing, logistics and industrial customers to improve quality and increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency, while reducing costs. In the first quarter of 2025, we identified opportunities for operational synergies amongst our production board test, defense and aerospace, and wireless test businesses leading to the creation of the Product Test division as a new segment effective March 2025. Our automated test equipment and robotics products and services include:\n\nIn January 2024, May 2024, and August 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share. Dividend payments for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, were $19.6 million and $57.0 million, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 28, 2025, we repurchased 5.1 million shares of common stock for $518.7 million, which excludes related excise tax, at an average price of $102.01 per share. We intend to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of common stock in 2025 and 2026, subject to market conditions. The cumulative repurchases under the 2023 repurchase program as of September 28, 2025, were 10.8 million shares of common stock for $1,113.8 million, which excludes related excise tax, at an average price per share of $104.21. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of common stock for $55.1 million, which excludes related excise tax, at an average price of $111.32 per share.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 28, 2025, we recorded $18.5 million of severance charges, $13.5 million of which is related to the Robotics restructuring which impacted approximately 150 employees, $2.2 million of which is related to Product Test and $1.4 million of which is related to Semiconductor Test. During the nine months ended September 28, 2025, we made $9.2 million of Robotics severance payments. We expect all Robotics severance payments to be made prior to the end of the third quarter of 2026. Additionally, we recorded $2.0 million of acquisition and divestiture expenses related primarily to the Quantifi Acquisition and $1.5 million of charges related to lease terminations.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2025, and September 29, 2024, was 15.8% and 7.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from the three months ended September 29, 2024, to the three months ended September 28, 2025, is primarily attributable to decreases in benefits related to reserves for uncertain tax positions, tax credits and the international provision of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. These were partially offset by an increase in benefit from a projected shift in the geographic distribution of income.\nNine Months 2025 Compared to Nine Months 2024\n\nOn May 31, 2025, we acquired privately held Quantifi Photonics (\"Quantifi\"), a leader in PIC test solutions for a total purchase price of approximately $127.2 million. This acquisition enables the delivery of scalable PIC test solutions and is included in our Product Test segment. Over time, we also intend to leverage the engineering expertise and technology to enhance functionality and create additional differentiation in our Semiconductor Test business, specifically with integration into our UltraFlexPlus platform.\nOn January 31, 2025, we acquired Infineon Technologies AG's (\"Infineon\") automated test equipment technology and associated development team (\"AET\") based in Regensburg, Germany for a total purchase price of 17.6 million Euros, equivalent to $18.3 million. AET adds resources and expertise to our company and strengthens the relationship between Teradyne and this key customer. AET is included in our Semiconductor Test segment.\nWhile revenues in our test businesses are predominantly in U.S. dollars, the majority of our Robotics revenue is denominated in foreign currencies. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar has, and will continue to, negatively affect Robotics revenue throughout 2025.\n\nOn July 4, 2025, H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" (“OBBBA”), was signed into law, enacting significant changes to U.S. corporate tax law. The OBBBA modified and made permanent several provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including reductions in scheduled increases for the rate of taxation of foreign income, immediate deductibility of U.S. research and development expenses, and reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property. As of September 28, 2025, the condensed consolidated financial statements were not materially impacted by the OBBBA. Teradyne continues to evaluate the provisions of the OBBBA and will incorporate any necessary adjustments as further guidance becomes available.\nWhile it is difficult to quantify the exact impact, current trade restrictions are limiting our ability to be competitive particularly in certain markets, where other companies are not subjected to "
