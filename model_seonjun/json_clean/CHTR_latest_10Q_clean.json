(“Cox Enterprises”) entered into a Transaction Agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) pursuant to which (i) Cox Enterprises will sell and transfer to Charter 100% of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries of Cox Communications, Inc. (“Cox Communications”) that conduct Cox Communications’ commercial fiber and managed IT and cloud services businesses (the “Equity Sale”), (ii) Cox Enterprises will contribute the equity interests of Cox Communications and certain other assets (other than certain excluded assets) primarily related to Cox Communications’ residential cable business to Charter Holdings (the “Contribution”), and (iii) Cox Enterprises will pay $1.00 to Charter (collectively, the “Cox Transactions”). Under the Transaction Agreement, Charter and Cox Enterprises may designate one or more wholly owned subsidiaries to take actions with respect to Charter and Cox Enterprises, respectively.\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, at the closing of the Cox Transactions (the “Closing”):\nin consideration of the Equity Sale, Charter will pay $3.5 billion in cash to Cox Enterprises;\nin consideration of the Contribution, Charter Holdings will (i) pay to Cox Enterprises $500 million in cash and (ii) issue to Cox Enterprises convertible preferred units of Charter Holdings with an aggregate liquidation preference of $6.0 billion, which will pay a 6.875% dividend per annum, and approximately 33.6 million Charter Holdings common units. The Charter Holdings convertible preferred units will be convertible into Charter Holdings common units, with an initial conversion price of $477.41, subject to certain adjustments. The Charter Holdings common units will be exchangeable by the holder, in certain circumstances, for cash or, at the election of Charter, Charter Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments; and\nin consideration of the $1.00 payment from Cox Enterprises to Charter, Charter will issue to Cox Enterprises one share of the newly created Charter Class C common stock. The Charter Class C common stock will be equivalent, economically, to the outstanding Charter Class A common stock and the Charter Class B common stock but will have a number of votes per share that reflect the voting power of the Charter Holdings common units and the Charter Holdings convertible preferred units held by Cox Enterprises on an as-converted, as-exchanged basis.\nThe combined entity will assume Cox Communications’ approximately $12.4 billion in outstanding net debt and finance leases.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, we added 493,000 mobile lines and video losses improved as compared to the prior year period. Internet losses remained relatively flat as compared to the prior year period. Sales were challenged by the competitive environment offset by lower customer churn. However, we remain focused on improving customer results through our pricing and packaging strategy launched in September 2024 and our brand platform, Life Unlimited. Life Unlimited emphasizes the power of our advanced network and cutting-edge connectivity products and services, and our simplified pricing and packaging strategy better utilizes our seamless connectivity and entertainment products to offer lower promotional and persistent bundled pricing to drive growth. Our Internet and mobile product bundles provide a differentiated connectivity experience by bringing together Spectrum Internet, Advanced WiFi and Unlimited Spectrum Mobile to offer consumers fast, reliable and secure online connections on their favorite devices at home and on the go in high-value packages. We have completed deals with every\n\nmajor programmer to deliver better flexibility and greater value to our customers by including seamless entertainment applications with our Spectrum TV services at no additional cost. In July 2025, we began launching the sale of these seamless entertainment applications to customers à la carte and just recently launched the Spectrum App Store, a digital storefront that helps customers activate, upgrade, buy and manage their streaming applications in one place. We also continue to evolve other elements of our video product and are deploying Xumo stream boxes to new video customers.\nOur new customer commitments focus on reliable connectivity, transparency, exceptional service and always improving. By continually improving our product set and offering consumers the opportunity to save money by switching to our services, we believe we can continue to penetrate our expanding footprint and sell additional products to our existing customers. We see operational benefits from the targeted investments we made in employee wages and benefits to build employee skill sets and tenure, as well as the continued investments in digitization of our customer service platforms, all with the goal of improving the customer experience, reducing transactions and driving customer growth and retention.\nWe spent $582 million and $1.6 billion on our subsidized rural construction initiative during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and activated approximately 124,000 and 336,000 subsidized rural passings, respectively. And we are upgrading our network to deliver symmetrical and multi-gigabit speeds across our footprint as part of our network evolution initiative.\nWe realized revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers; minor differences may exist due to rounding):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nIncome from operations\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Charter shareholders plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, other income (expenses), net and other operating (income) expenses, net, such as special charges, merger and acquisition costs and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. See “Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow” for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.\nTotal revenues decreased slightly during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and remained relatively constant during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the corresponding periods in 2024 primarily due to lower customers and lower advertising sales offset by mobile line growth and higher average revenue per customer. Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations were also impacted by an increase in marketing and residential sales expense.\n\nThe following table summarizes our customer statistics for Internet, mobile, video and voice as of September 30, 2025 and 2024 (in thousands except per customer data and footnotes).\nCustomer Relationships\nTotal Customer Relationships\nMonthly Residential Revenue per Residential Customer\nMonthly Small Business Revenue per Small Business Customer\nTotal Internet Customers\nTotal Video Customers\nTotal Voice Customers\nMid-Market & Large Business Primary Service Units (\"PSUs\")\nWe calculate the aging of customer accounts based on the monthly billing cycle for each account in accordance with our collection policies. On that basis, as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, customers include approximately 87,100 and 127,300 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 60 days past due, approximately 10,500 and 11,900 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 90 days past due and approximately 13,200 and 11,800 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 120 days past due. Past due totals as of September 30, 2025 reflect in part certain revisions to customer account balances generated by changes to our collection procedures initiated in the third quarter of 2025, which were made to better align with industry practices.\nCustomer relationships include the number of customers that receive one or more levels of service, encompassing Internet, mobile, video and voice services, without regard to which service(s) such customers receive. Customers who reside in residential multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”) and that are billed under bulk contracts are counted based on the number of billed units within each bulk MDU. Total customer relationships exclude mid-market & large business and mobile-only customer relationships.\nMonthly residential revenue per residential customer is calculated as total residential quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average residential customer relationships during the respective quarter and excludes mobile-only customers.\nMonthly small business revenue per small business customer is calculated as total small business quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average small business customer relationships during the respective quarter and excludes mobile-only customers.\nMobile lines include phones and tablets which require one of our standard rate plans (e.g., \"Unlimited\" or \"By the Gig\"). Mobile lines exclude wearables and other devices that do not require standard phone rate plans.\n\nOther revenues consist of revenue from mobile and video device sales, processing fees, regional sports and news channels (excluding intercompany charges or advertising sales on those channels), Rural Development Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”) subsidy revenue, home shopping, wire maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues increased $80 million and $307 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2024 primarily due to higher mobile device sales.\nOperating costs and expenses\nThe change in our operating costs and expenses, exclusive of items shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations, are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\nOther costs of revenue\nField and technology operations\nMarketing and residential sales\nProgramming costs we"
