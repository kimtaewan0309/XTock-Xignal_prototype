  "item1_clean": "Eversource Energy (Eversource), headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut, is a public utility holding company subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. We are engaged primarily in the energy delivery business through the following wholly-owned utility subsidiaries:\nThe Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut;\nNSTAR Electric Company (NSTAR Electric), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of eastern and western Massachusetts and owns solar power facilities, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Harbor Electric Energy Company (HEEC), also a regulated electric utility that distributes electric energy to its sole customer;\nPublic Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of New Hampshire;\nNSTAR Gas Company (NSTAR Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Massachusetts;\nEversource Gas Company of Massachusetts (EGMA), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Massachusetts;\nYankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut; and\nAquarion Company (Aquarion), a utility holding company that owns five separate regulated water utility subsidiaries and collectively serves residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal and fire protection customers in parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Eversource is currently in the process of selling its Aquarion water distribution business. For further information, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Pending Sale of Aquarion\" in the accompanying Item 7,\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH also serve New England customers through Eversource's electric transmission business. Along with NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas, each is doing business as Eversource Energy in its respective service territory.\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each report their financial results separately. We also include information in this report on a segment basis for Eversource. Eversource has four reportable segments: electric distribution, electric transmission, natural gas distribution and water distribution. These segments represent substantially all of Eversource's total consolidated revenues. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH do not report separate business segments.\nEversource’s previous offshore wind business included 50 percent ownership interests in each of North East Offshore and South Fork Class B Member, LLC. In the third quarter of 2024, Eversource sold its interest in these entities, and in doing so, sold its interests in the Revolution Wind project, the South Fork Wind project, and the Sunrise Wind project. Eversource’s current offshore wind business is now comprised only of a noncontrolling tax equity investment in South Fork Wind. For more information, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Offshore Wind Business\" in the accompanying Item 7,\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT\nEversource's electric distribution segment consists of the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, which are engaged in the distribution of electricity to retail customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively, and the solar power facilities of NSTAR Electric.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – CONNECTICUT – THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY\nCL&P's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers. As of December 31, 2024, CL&P furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 1.30 million customers in 157 cities and towns in Connecticut. CL&P does not own any electric generation facilities.\nCL&P is subject to regulation by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA), which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities. CL&P's present general rate structure consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial and industrial services.\nUnder Connecticut law, all of CL&P's customers are entitled to choose their energy suppliers, while CL&P remains their electric distribution company. For those customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier, CL&P purchases power on behalf of, and passes the related cost without mark-up through to, those customers under standard service (SS) rates for customers with less than 500 kilowatts of demand (residential customers and small and medium commercial and industrial customers), and supplier of last resort service (LRS) rates for customers with 500 kilowatts or more of demand (larger commercial and industrial customers). CL&P charges customers only the amount that it pays generators for producing electricity and does not earn a profit on the cost of electricity.\nCL&P's retail rates include an energy supply component and a delivery service component, which includes distribution, transmission, conservation, renewable energy programs and other public benefit charges that are assessed on all customers. The rates established by PURA for CL&P, which are grouped by the customer bill components, are comprised of the following:\nCost of electricity from suppliers based on competitive procurements.\nAn electric generation service charge, which recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers. The generation service charge is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nCost to build, maintain, repair and operate the distribution grid, including the poles, lines, and meters that deliver power from the substation. It also includes the cost of resiliency and reliability improvements.\nA distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers, as well as ongoing operating costs to maintain the infrastructure.\nA revenue decoupling adjustment that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by PURA.\nAn Electric System Improvements (ESI) charge, which collects the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers above the level recovered through the distribution charge. The ESI also recovers costs associated with CL&P’s system resiliency program. The ESI is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers. In 2023, the state of Connecticut enacted a law that prohibits CL&P’s ESI capital tracking mechanism from being reauthorized in the next general distribution proceeding. The ESI will therefore remain in place until base distribution rates are adjusted in CL&P’s next general distribution rate proceeding.\nA Competitive Transition Assessment (CTA) charge, assessed to recover stranded costs associated with electric industry restructuring such as various IPP contracts. The CTA is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nCost to support energy programs mandated by the state and federal government for financial assistance and energy efficiency programs, purchasing renewable and carbon-free electricity, and funding solar and electric vehicle incentives.\nA Federally Mandated Congestion Charge (FMCC), which recovers any costs imposed by the FERC as part of the New England Standard Market Design, including locational marginal pricing, locational installed capacity payments, any costs approved by PURA to reduce these charges, as well as other costs approved by PURA. These costs include costs associated with ISO-NE, costs to avoid congestion on the transmission system, purchase contracts with zero-carbon energy generators (including the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear contracts) and with renewable energy generators, costs for capacity and gas peaker plants, renewable energy credits, and other initiatives required by state law. The non-bypassable component of the FMCC is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers. CL&P is required by regulation to purchase electric generation from Millstone and Seabrook under PURA-approved PPAs entered into in 2019. CL&P does not have legislative authority to use this purchased output to serve its customer load and therefore sells the energy into the wholesale market and uses the proceeds from the energy sales to offset the contract costs. The net cost or net sales amount is recovered from, or refunded to, customers in the non-bypassable component of the FMCC rate with no company profit.\nA Systems Benefits Charge (SBC), established to fund expenses associated with various hardship and low-income programs. The SBC is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nA Renewable Energy Investment Charge, which is used to promote investment in renewable energy sources. Amounts collected by this charge are deposited into the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund and administered by the Connecticut Green Bank.\nA Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) charge established to implement cost-effective energy conservation programs and market transformation initiatives. The CAM charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers through an approved adjustment to the following year’s energy conservation spending plan budget.\nCost to maintain high voltage towers and lines, including building, maintaining and operating the regional transmission system that brings electricity from power generators to the local distribution system.\nA transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market. The transmission charge is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nDistribution Rate Case and Settlement Agreement\n: CL&P's distribution rates were established in an April 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective May 1, 2018, and incremental step adjustments effective May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2020. In accordance with a 2021 settlement agreement, CL&P agreed that its current base distribution rates would be frozen, subject to certain customer credits, until no earlier than January 1, 2024. The rate freeze applied only to base distribution rates (including storm costs) and not to other rate mechanisms such as the retail rate components, rate reconciling mechanisms",
  "item7_clean": "On October 17, 2024, PURA issued a proposed final decision on recovery of the costs for AMI implementation. Written exceptions to the proposed final decision were filed on October 31, 2024, and oral arguments were presented on November 7, 2024. CL&P’s written exceptions focused on three main aspects of the proposed decision, which include (1) clarifying the prudence standard to be used in evaluating AMI investments, (2) timing of prudency reviews, and (3) cost recovery related to incremental O&M expenses. On December 4, 2024, PURA issued a final decision on the recovery of costs for AMI implementation. On December 9, 2024, CL&P filed a petition for reconsideration because PURA had not fully resolved the issues CL&P raised in its October 31, 2024 written exceptions. On January 3, 2025, PURA stated it will evaluate the merits of CL&P’s petition for reconsideration. Under state law, PURA is expected to issue its decision within 90 days of January 3, 2025.\nYankee Gas Distribution Rate Case:\nOn November 12, 2024, Yankee Gas filed an application with PURA to amend its existing distribution rates for effect on November 1, 2025. Yankee Gas’s rate application requested approval of a distribution rate increase of $209 million, which included a base distribution rate increase of $274 million, partially offset by a reduction of $65 million in the combined Gas System Improvements and System Expansion Reconciliation rates. In addition, Yankee Gas requested approval to implement a rate credit of $37.4 million to offset the PGA rate for non-firm margin credits over one year beginning November 1, 2025. As part of the rate case, Yankee Gas proposed to implement a multi-year performance-based rate making plan with a four-year initial term from November 1, 2025 to October 31, 2029 that would adjust rates annually and includes performance metrics. A final decision by PURA is expected in October 2025.\nAquarion Water Company of Connecticut Distribution Rate Case:\nOn August 29, 2022, Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut (AWC-CT) filed an application with PURA to amend its existing rate schedules to address an operating revenue deficiency. AWC-CT’s rate application requested approval of rate increases of $27.5 million, an additional $13.6 million, and an additional $8.8 million, effective March 15, 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. On March 15, 2023, PURA issued a final decision that rejected this request. In this decision, PURA ordered a decrease to total authorized revenues of $4.0 million effective March 15, 2023. The decision allows an authorized regulatory ROE of 8.70 percent. On March 30, 2023, AWC-CT filed an appeal on the decision and requested a stay of the decision with the State of Connecticut Superior Court. On April 5, 2023, the Court temporarily granted AWC-CT’s request to stay and on May 25, 2023 granted a permanent stay of certain orders affecting base rates, which would keep existing rates in place until the appeal is completed. The stay included the condition that AWC-CT place any revenue received from customers above the rates and amounts authorized in the March 15, 2023 decision in a separate, interest bearing account until further order. On March 25, 2024, the State of Connecticut Superior Court issued a decision on the appeal which dismissed nine, remanded back to PURA two, and partially remanded one of AWC-CT’s twelve claims of error in its appeal. On March 28, 2024, AWC-CT filed an appeal of the Connecticut Superior Court decision to the Connecticut Appellate Court, and that appeal was subsequently transferred to the Connecticut Supreme Court for review. A ruling on the appeal is pending.\nOn April 18, 2024, PURA initiated a docket to address the matters on remand. On July 31, 2024, PURA issued a final decision in this docket and increased AWC-CT’s approved revenue requirement by $0.1 million above the amount authorized in the March 15, 2023 decision. Rates went into effect on July 31, 2024. On September 13, 2024, AWC-CT filed an appeal of PURA’s July 31, 2024 final decision to the Connecticut Superior Court. A ruling on the appeal is pending.\nAs a result of the State of Connecticut Superior Court’s March 2024 decision on the appeal, AWC-CT recorded the impacts of the PURA rate case decision from the effective date of the order on March 15, 2023 through December 31, 2024. The impacts primarily include a reduction to depreciation expense to reflect lower depreciation rates ordered by PURA in its final decision, partially offset by lower authorized revenues. These adjustments resulted in an after-tax benefit of $11.6 million in 2024.\nNSTAR Electric Distribution Rates\n: NSTAR Electric’s PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation, exogenous events and future capital additions based on a historical five-year average of total capital additions. On September 16, 2024, NSTAR Electric submitted its annual PBR Adjustment filing for a $55.8 million increase to base distribution rates, for effect on January 1, 2025. The requested base distribution rate increase is comprised of a $35.3 million inflation-based adjustment and a $20.5 million adjustment for capital additions based on the difference between the historical five-year average of total capital additions and the base capital revenue requirement. On December 23, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nNSTAR Electric CIP Filing:\nOn December 30, 2022, the DPU approved a provisional system planning tariff for the recovery of costs associated with a capital investment project (CIP) proposal submitted by NSTAR Electric for one of six geographic study areas in its service territory in accordance with DPU’s directives. The DPU established a new, provisional framework for planning and funding upgrades to the electric power system to foster development and interconnection of distributed energy facilities. Under the DPU program, NSTAR Electric has filed infrastructure upgrade proposals to be built within a four-year construction timeframe that allocate the costs of interconnection upgrades between the interconnecting distributed generation facility and distribution customers based on a technical analysis of capacity benefits. Payments made by the distributed generation facility will be applied against the total capital investment made by NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Electric will earn a return on the net investment. The amount allocated to distribution customers will be recovered through a reconciling mechanism, the Provisional System Planning Tariff. The DPU approved the first of these provisional system planning projects, the Marion-Fairhaven group study area, which will enable 141 MW of distributed energy resources (DER) to be interconnected at a total estimated cost of $120 million. Of the total $120 million, $66 million will be allocated to distribution customers, once the enabled distributed energy facilities capacity is fully subscribed by distributed energy facilities interconnecting customers. Additionally, NSTAR Electric will proceed with construction of approximately $54 million of transmission upgrades necessary to improve local reliability and integrate distribution energy resources in the Marion-Fairhaven area and recover the amount through local transmission rates.\nOn June 4, 2024, the DPU approved four of the remaining five CIPs that were originally submitted by NSTAR Electric. These included the Plainfield-Blandford CIP, which will enable 40 MW of DER to be interconnected at a total estimated distribution investment of $37 million, the Dartmouth-Westport CIP which enables 60 MW of DER for a total distribution investment of $58 million, the Plymouth CIP which enables 380 MW of DER for a total distribution investment of $152 million and the Cape Cod CIP which enables 296 MW of DER for a total distribution investment of $170 million. Of the total $417 million for these four recently approved CIPs, $183 million will be allocated to distribution customers, once the enabled distributed energy facilities capacity is fully subscribed by distributed energy facilities interconnecting customers. Additionally, NSTAR Electric will proceed with construction of approximately $64 million of transmission upgrades necessary to improve local reliability and integrate distribution energy resources in the four CIP areas and recover the amount through local transmission rates. On January 27, 2025, NSTAR Electric filed a petition with the DPU to withdraw the sixth CIP project, Freetown, that was originally submitted.\nNSTAR Electric’s Electric Sector Modernization Plan (ESMP) Filing\n: On January 29, 2024, in accordance with Massachusetts state law, NSTAR Electric filed its ESMP with the DPU. The law required each electric distribution company to develop and file a comprehensive distribution system plan to proactively upgrade the distribution system (and, where applicable, the associated transmission system) to: (i) improve grid reliability, communications and resiliency; (ii) enable increased, timely adoption of renewable energy and distributed energy resources; (iii) promote energy storage and electrification technologies necessary to decarbonize the environment and economy; (iv) prepare for future climate-driven impacts on the transmission and distribution systems; (v) accommodate increased transportation electrification, increased building electrification and other potential future demands on distribution and, where applicable, the transmission system; and (vi) minimize or mitigate impacts on Massachusetts ratepayers, thereby helping the state realize its statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits and sublimits under the law. NSTAR Electric’s plan meets these requirements by providing a comprehensive view of all the investments required to build a safer, more reliable, more resilient electric distribution system to enable an affordable, equitable clean energy transition taking into account the needs of environmental justice communities. For the five-year period from 2025 through 2029, the proposed incremental distribution capital investment is $608 million and the incremental distribution expense amount is $211 million. On August 29, 2024, the DPU approved the overall ESMP for a five-year period commencing July 1, 2025.\nOn November 21, 2024, the DPU opened a second phase of the proceeding to consider a short-term ESMP-focused cost recovery mechanism and metrics. In issuing the notice of proceeding, the DPU limited the review of investment in this docket and excluded NSTAR Electric’s ESMP proposals regarding the EV Phase II extension, low and moderate income solar and the new CIPs. These investments will be reviewed in separate proceedings. This reduced the amount of company-proposed incremental capital investment to $295 million and the incremental expense to $44 million related to resiliency and grid modernization. NSTAR Electric filed its proposed tariff and testimony on December 18, 2024, and is currently in the discovery process, which will be followed by hearings and briefing with completion of the proceeding and final orders expected prior to the start of the plan in July 2025.\nNSTAR Gas Distribution Rates:\nNSTAR Gas’ PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation and exogenous events. On September 16, 2024, NSTAR Gas submitted its annual PBR Adjustment filing for a $12.7 million increase to base distribution rates for effect on November 1, 2024. On October 30, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nEGMA Distribution Rates:\nOn November 4, 2024, EGMA submitted a revised filing for its first rate base reset for rates to be effective November 1, 2024, in accordance with an October 7, 2020 EGMA Rate Settlement Agreement approved by the DPU. The compliance filing was ordered by the DPU on October 31, 2024. The rate base reset occurring on November 1, 2024 adjusted distribution rates to account for capital additions (including the roll-in of GSEP capital additions), depreciation expense, property taxes, and return on rate base for capital additions placed into service through December 31, 2023. The total revenue requirement calculated for the first rate base reset is an increase to base distribution rates of $147.8 million, of which $34.0 million is associated with GSEP investments through December 31, 2023. Under the terms of the Rate Settlement Agreement, EGMA applied a cap on the revenue change effective November 1, 2024, and the amount in excess of the cap will be deferred for recovery through the Local Distribution Adjustment Clause (LDAC) on May 1, 2025, including carrying charges. After adjusting for the cap, the increase to base distribution rates is $85.6 million effective November 1, 2024 (of which $8.8 million is offset by a reduction in the GSEP revenue requirement and GSEP rate also taking effect on November 1, 2024 for a net distribution rate change on November 1, 2024 of $76.8 million). Base distribution rates will be increased effective November 1, 2025 to incorporate the $62.2 million remaining revenue requirement. On November 7, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nFuture of Gas Docket:\nIn October 2020, the DPU opened Docket “DPU 20-80 The Future of Gas” to examine the role of Massachusetts natural gas local distribution companies (LDCs) in helping to meet the state’s 2050 climate goals. In December 2023, the DPU issued an order for this docket. The DPU will consider and, in some cases, require new processes and analysis for traditional natural gas investments, which may require significant changes to the LDC planning process and business models. The DPU intends to put policies and structures in place that would protect customers as Massachusetts works to decarbonize the building sector, which may involve subsequent dockets and regulatory proceedings and potentially recasting the role of LDCs in Massachusetts. The DPU preserved customer choice for energy needs and encouraged further development of decarbonized alternatives, such as the networked geothermal systems that NSTAR Gas is piloting in Framingham, Massachusetts.\nOn December 29, 2023, Eversource and other LDCs sought formal clarity from the DPU to fully understand the resulting impact to their natural gas businesses and the associated timing of any impacts. On April 2, 2024, the DPU issued an order responding to the request for clarification indicating that the LDCs shall implement the inclusion of a Non-Gas Pipeline Alternatives (NPA) analysis on all project authorizations effective immediately. Existing NPA analysis processes will be used until such time a formal stakeholder-based NPA analysis framework is established and approved by the DPU. Eversource, along with the other LDCs, have engaged a consultant to inform the development of the required NPA framework by conducting a stakeholder engagement process as mandated by the order. Another component of the order is the submission of climate compliance plans every five years beginning April 1, 2025. The climate compliance plan filings will include the NPA frameworks, along with energy transitions plans including details on the management of embedded infrastructure investments and cost recovery. Eversource along with the LDCs, have also contracted a consultant to model and investigate statewide cost recovery scenarios including under accelerated depreciation rates.\nThe DPU also indicated that NSTAR Gas and EGMA are not required to provide climate compliance performance metrics in the next PBR filing, however would be expected to propose metrics at the latest in the next base distribution rate proceeding. GHG emissions reporting was not changed from the order, however, effective November of 2024, reporting requirements have changed per the MA DEP and these requirements implement registration and GHG emissions reporting requirements for companies selling and distributing heating fuels to homes and businesses in Massachusetts, including suppliers of natural gas, fuel ",
