  "item1_clean": "We sell our products to cloud service providers, computer manufacturers and OEMs, resellers, distributors and retailers throughout the world. We maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Our international sales, which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies but do not include sales to U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies, represented\n58% and 57% of our net revenue for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our sales are subject to certain risks, including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations. For a discussion of such risks, see Part I, Item 1A,\nWe perform our marketing and advertising functions both internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and end-user markets. We also maintain customer relationships through direct communication and by providing information and support through our website. In accordance with standard storage industry practice, we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing expenditures. We also provide distributors, resellers and OEMs with other sales incentive programs.\nFor 2025, three customers accounted for 17%, 12%, and 10%, respectively, of our net revenue. For 2024 and 2023, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue.\nCyclicality and Seasonality\nOur business is subject to variability of sales because it is largely dependent on the buying patterns of our large Cloud customers, driven by their needs for deploying our technology in their data center buildouts, as well as on their ability to procure other products that go into such buildouts. Our business is also impacted by cyclicality in the industry, as well as macroeconomic factors. For a discussion of associated risks, see Part I, Item 1A,\nService and Warranty\n\nWe generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of sale depending on the type of product, with a small number of products having a warranty ranging up to ten years or more. Our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement. We have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing, processing or recertification of returned products for our customers. For additional information regarding our service and warranty policy, see Part II, Item 8, Note 1,\nOrganization and Basis of Presentation,\nSupplemental Financial Statement Data,\nOur people strategy supports our vision of unleashing the power and value of data and our mission to be the market leader in data storage, delivering solutions for now and the future. At the end of 2025, we employed approximately 40,000 people worldwide. Our diverse team spans 24 countries with approximately 88% of our employees in Asia Pacific, approximately 11% in the Americas and less than 1% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nTalent Growth and Engagement\nWe invest in developing our people to lead us into the future. To help our employees reach their full potential, we aim to cultivate an environment that encourages learning, development and career growth. Our performance framework includes setting goals to establish clear expectations and receiving feedback and coaching to achieve them. Our on-demand learning management system offers learning activities to help employees map their career journey, access learning online and track progress against development goals. We also provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities to our factory employees through on-the-job training, technical classes, workshops and partnerships with universities and colleges.\nWe make it a priority to recruit exceptional talent across the organization. We continue to foster the next generation of talent through our intern and new college graduate recruitment programs, and we converted about 40% of our eligible global intern population to employees in 2025. We have a U.S. Department of Labor approved apprenticeship program, serving as a career pathway for veterans and other underserved populations, which helps us build a workforce that mirrors the communities that we serve.\nWe believe employee engagement is key to performance and retention and that by listening to our employees we can better understand how we enable them to do their best work. We use a combination of our employee survey and listening sessions at all levels to understand what we are doing well and identify opportunities to strengthen employee engagement in support of our business strategy.\nWe strive to cultivate an inclusive environment where every individual feels valued, respected, and appreciated, thereby enabling them to contribute effectively to the organization and excel in their roles. Our initiatives celebrate the diversity of our workforce and ensure that all voices are heard. Our Employee Resource Groups are employee-led and foster connections based on a shared identity or background and are open to all employees who want to join.\nWe continued our commitment to conducting business in an ethical way around the world. In 2025, we were named one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere for the seventh consecutive year. Our employees also regularly participate in philanthropy to support the communities in which they work and live. In 2025, more than half of our employees around the world gave their time to participate in company-sponsored volunteer events.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe believe that recognition is crucial for retaining and motivating our employees, and we are committed to rewarding performance with competitive compensation consisting of base salary and short-term and long-term incentives. We also offer a global recognition program to celebrate the contributions of employees who bring to life our core values: Customers, Results, Connection, Excellence, and Innovation.\nWe invest in the physical, mental and financial well-being of our people through a dynamic and differentiated Total Rewards program that aligns to our culture and values. We provide competitive benefits (which vary by country or region), including health coverage, life and disability insurance, retirement plans, paid time off, employee assistance program and employee stock purchase plan.\nWe benchmark our compensation and benefits programs annually using market data from reputable third-party consultants. We also conduct internal focus groups and employee surveys to inform programs and identify opportunities. To ensure that our pay practices are fair, we conduct regular pay equity assessments to promote equal pay for equal work, as well as regularly engaging in a living wage analysis.\nWe are committed to creating a safe work environment everywhere we operate. We provide extensive health and safety resources and training to all employees, especially those working in our manufacturing facilities, where we use an integrated management system to manage health and safety standards.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, the environment, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position and overall business. See Part I, Item 1A,\nfor a discussion of these potential impacts.\nCorporate Responsibility and Sustainability\nAt Western Digital, sustainability is about innovating with technology to positively impact our future. We believe that sustainability can create value for everyone in our value chain and serves as a competitive differentiator, while minimizing our environmental footprint, influencing our ecosystem, empowering and connecting our stakeholders and embedding sustainability in our decision-making processes. Our sustainability strategy is reflected through sustainability-focused initiatives as well as day-to-day activities, including our adoption of sustainability-focused policies and procedures, fostering an inclusive workplace, our constant drive toward more efficient use of materials and energy, our careful and active management of our supply chain, our community-focused volunteerism programs and philanthropic initiatives and our impactful, globally-integrated ethics and compliance program.\nWe work to minimize our impact on the environment by reducing emissions, water withdrawal and waste to landfills, and by evaluating and enhancing our climate resiliency.\nWe strive to innovate in ways that reduce the energy used by our products, the energy used to manufacture them and the amount of new materials required to manufacture them.\nWe actively collaborate with customers, suppliers, industry associations, governments, academics, standards organizations and industry partners to generate value, reduce emissions across the ecosystem, and increase circularity to reduce raw materials extraction.\nWe seek to foster a workplace of inclusion by hiring and developing team members with different experiences and creating opportunities for connections across the company through our Employee Resource Groups.\nWe are guided by our global pillars centered on hunger relief, environmental quality and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education and activate employees locally to have an impact on their community.\nWe seek to protect the human rights and civil liberties of our employees through policies, procedures and programs that avoid risks of compulsory and child labor, both within our company and throughout our supply chain.\nWe educate our employees annually on relevant ethics and compliance topics, publish accessible guidance on ethical issues and related company resources in our Global Code of Conduct and encourage reporting of ethical concerns through any of several global and local reporting channels.\nWe set new environmental goals post-Separation to expand our focus to include carbon-free energy alternatives, add an upstream direct emissions reduction goal and goals for increasing recycled content in products and packaging for our enterprise HDD portfolio.\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain an Internet website at\nwww.westerndigital.com\nwww.westerndigital.com\nthat contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, including us.\n\nWestern Digital was founded\n1970 and is a Standard & Poor’s 500 (“S&P 500”) company headquartered in San Jose, California. We are a leading developer, manufacturer, and provider of data storage devices and solutions based on hard disk drive (“HDD”) technology. HDDs are critical components in the worldwide data infrastructure market, powering the digital economy. HDDs provide reliable, cost-effective, high-capacity storage needs for a wide range of applications, ranging from cloud data centers, enterprise storage systems, edge computing, and video surveillance to client and consumer devices.\nOn February 21, 2025 (the “Separation Date”), we completed the separation of our HDD and Flash business units (the “Separation”) to create two independent public companies, with Western Digital focusing on our existing HDD business and Sandisk Corporation (“Sandisk”), formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, holding the Flash business. We believe the Separation better positions each business unit to execute innovative technology and product development, capitalize on unique growth opportunities, extend respective leadership positions, operate more efficiently with distinct capital structures, and pursue capital allocation strategies that maximize long-term shareholder value.\nAs glo",
  "item7_clean": "Net cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\nInvesting activities\nFinancing activities\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\nWe had previously reached a final agreement with the IRS and received notices of deficiency with respect to years 2008 through 2012, and in February 2024, we also reached a final agreement for resolving the notices of proposed adjustments with respect to years 2013 through 2015. During the year ended June 27, 2025, we made payments of $130 million for interest with respect to years 2008 through 2012 and $32 million for tax and interest with respect to years 2013 through 2015, resulting in no remaining liability as of June 27, 2025 related to all years from 2008 through 2015.\nIn connection with settlements for the years 2008 through 2015, we expect to realize reductions to our mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations and tax savings from interest deductions in future years aggregating to $166 million. Of this amount, $65 million of interest savings from the interest paid with respect to years 2008 through 2015 is classified as a deferred tax asset due to interest expense limitation rules. See Part II, Item 8, Note 13,\nAs a result of the Separation, we no longer have any capital expenditure requirements for the Flash business or its joint ventures with Kioxia Corporation. We expect our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2026 to be between 4% to 6% of our net revenue.\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents and our available 2027 Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt, dividend and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. We believe we can also access the various debt and equity capital markets to further supplement our liquidity position if necessary. Our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in Part I, Item 1A,\nA total of $0.98 billion and\nof our cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the U.S. as of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. There are no material tax consequences that were not previously accrued for on the repatriation of this cash.\nOur cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government agency securities. In addition, from time to time, we also invest directly in certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and corporate and municipal notes and bonds.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by or used in operating activities primarily consists of net income or loss, adjusted for non-cash charges, plus or minus changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities was\nfor 2025, as compared to $307 million of net cash used for such changes for 2024, which largely reflects an increase in net operating assets and liabilities resulting from the increase in the volume of our business as well as the timing and amount of tax payments. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities are largely affected by our working capital requirements, which are dependent on our volume of business and the effective management of our cash conversion cycle as well as timing of payments for taxes. Our cash conversion cycle measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales. At the end of the respective fourth quarters, the cash conversion cycles were as follows (in days):\nDays sales outstanding\nDays payables outstanding\nCash conversion cycle\nChanges in days sales outstanding (“DSO”) are generally due to the timing of shipments to and collections from customers. Changes in days in inventory (“DIO”) are generally related to the timing of inventory builds and shipments to customers. Changes in days payables outstanding (“DPO”) are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period. From time to time, we make payment term modifications with vendors through negotiations with them or by granting to, or receiving from, our vendors payment term accommodations. We make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our cash balances.\nIn 2025, DSO decreased by 4 days over the prior year, reflecting timing of shipments and customer collections. DIO decreased by 21 days over the prior year, primarily reflecting improvements in inventory management. DPO increased by 2 days over the prior year, primarily due to more favorable payment terms and routine variations in the timing of purchases and payments during the period.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2025 primarily consisted of $401 million in net proceeds from our sale of a majority interest in one of our subsidiaries and $148 million in net notes receivable proceeds from Flash Ventures, partially offset by $412 million in capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities in 2024 primarily consisted of $487 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by $239 million in net notes receivable proceeds from Flash Ventures and $195 million in proceeds from the sale-leaseback of property, plant and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring 2025, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of $2.09 billion used for the partial repayment of the 2026 Notes, repayment of borrowings on the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility, and scheduled principal payments on our Term Loan A-2 and Term Loan A-3; $1.37 billion of cash transferred to Sandisk at the Separation; $149 million in share repurchases; $113 million for taxes paid on vested stock awards; $73 million in debt issuance costs; and $44 million in dividends on our common stock and our Series A Preferred Stock. These uses were partially offset by $2.00 billion of proceeds from drawing on the Sandisk credit facilities in connection with the Separation, $150 million from the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility, and $77 million from issuances of shares under our employee stock plans. During 2024, net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of $3.00 billion in proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, the drawdown of a delayed draw term loan and draws on the revolving credit facility. These sources were partially offset by $2.10 billion used for the repayment of draws on the revolving credit facility, repayments of a delayed draw term loan, scheduled payments on the Term Loan A-2, and settlement of our remaining 1.50% convertible senior notes due February 1, 2024 (the “2024 Convertible Notes”); $505 million used to repurchase a portion of the 2024 Convertible Notes; and $155 million for the purchase of capped calls to hedge the potential dilution impact of the conversion feature of the 2028 Convertible Notes.\nA discussion of our cash flows for 2023, including a comparison of such cash flows to 2024, is included in Part II, Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than certain indemnification provisions (see “Short- and Long-term Liquidity –\nPurchase Obligations and Other Commitments\n” below), we do not have any other material off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any other obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any variable interest entities.\nShort- and Long-term Liquidity\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe following is a summary of our known material cash requirements, including those for capital expenditures, as of June 27, 2025. In addition, see the discussions further below related to unrecognized tax benefits, litigation matters, cash dividend program, dividend rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, foreign exchange contracts and indemnifications.\n2-3 Years (2027-2028)\n4-5 Years (2029-2030)\nMore than 5 Years (Beyond 2030)\nLong-term debt, including current portion\nPurchase obligations and other commitments\nMandatory deemed repatriation tax\nPrincipal portion of debt, excluding issuance costs.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAs of June 27, 2025, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties) was approximately $569 million. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in liabilities for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of June 27, 2025, were approximately $82 million. Of these amounts, approximately $498 million could result in potential cash payments, of which $332 million is reasonably expected to be paid within the next twelve months. This potential cash payment is expected to be netted with offsetting favorable tax receivables totaling $148 million, including a reduction to our mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations related to the settlement for the years 2008 through 2015, for a potential net cash payment of $184 million.\nAs noted above, we had previously reached a final agreement with the IRS regarding notices of deficiency with respect to years 2008 through 2012 and in February 2024, we also reached a final agreement for resolving the notices of proposed adjustments with respect to years 2013 through 2015. During the year ended June 27, 2025, we made payments of $130 million for interest with respect to years 2008 through 2012 and $32 million for tax and interest with respect to years 2013 through 2015, resulting in no remaining liability as of June 27, 2025 related to all years from 2008 through 2015.\nIn connection with settlements for the years 2008 through 2015, we expect to realize reductions to our mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations and tax savings from interest deductions in future years aggregating to approximately $166 million. Of this amount, $65 million of interest savings from the interest paid with respect to years 2008 through 2015 is classified as a deferred tax asset due to interest expense limitation rules. See Part II, Item 8, Note 13,\nFor additional information on our litigation matters, see Part II, Item 8, Note 17,\nCash Dividend Program\nOn April 29, 2025, our Board of Directors authorized the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend program. Under the cash dividend program, holders of our common stock will receive dividends when and as declared by our Board of Directors. During the year ended June 27, 2025, we paid cash dividends of $0.10 per share of our outstanding common stock, totaling $36 million, including payment to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with their participation rights.\nSubsequent to year-end, on July 29, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share of our common stock, which will be paid on September 18, 2025 to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 4, 2025.\nWe may modify, suspend, or cancel our cash dividend program in any manner and at any time. The amount of future dividends under our cash dividend program, and the declaration and payment thereof, will be based upon all relevant factors, including our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements and restrictions under our Loan Agreement and other financing agreements, and shall be in compliance with applicable law.\nAs of June 27, 2025, 235,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock remained outstanding. These shares are entitled to cumulative preferred dividends and will also participate in any dividends declared for common shareholders on an as-converted equivalent basis. See Part II, Item 8, Note 12,\nShareholders’ Equity and Convertible Preferred Stock\nAs described in “Key Developments –\nCapital Allocation Actions\n” above, we undertook several financing actions during 2025, including the amendment of our Credit Facility in connection with the Separation and the exchange of a portion of our retained interest in Sandisk shares to reduce a portion of our TLA-3 loan balance.\nThe Company issued $1.60 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes in November 2023, which bear interest at an annual rate of 3.00% and mature on November 15, 2028 (the “2028 Convertible Notes”). The 2028 Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of any holder beginning August 15, 2028 at a conversion price of approximately $37.82 per share of common stock (which conversion price has been adjusted from approximately $52.20 in accordance with the indenture as a result of the Separation). Prior to August 15, 2028, if the trading price of our common stock remains above 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the end of a calendar quarter, holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes would have the right to convert the 2028 Convertible Notes during the next succeeding calendar quarter. The 2028 Convertible Notes are also convertible prior to August 15, 2028 upon the occurrence of certain corporate events. Upon any conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we will pay cash for the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted.\nThe sale price conditional conversion feature of the 2028 Convertible Notes was triggered during the calendar quarter ended June 30, 2025 and, accordingly, the holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes have the right to convert the notes during the succeeding calendar quarter ending September 30, 2025. As a result, the 2028 Convertible Notes were classified as Short-term debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 27, 2025. The Company will continue to evaluate the conversion feature quarterly to determine if the 2028 Convertible Notes become convertible in future periods.\nIn addition to our outstanding debt, as of June 27, 2025, we had $1.25 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility maturing in January 2027 (the “2027 Revolving Credit Facility”), subject to customary conditions under the Loan Agreement. The agreements governing our credit facilities each include limits on secured indebtedness and certain types of unsecured subsidiary indebtedness and require us and certain of our subsidiaries to provide guarantees and collateral to the extent the conditions providing for such guarantees and collateral are met. The loan agreement governing our 2027 Revolving Credit Facility and our Term Loan A-3 (as amended, the “Loan Agreement”) requires us to comply with a financial leverage ratio covenant. As of June 27, 2025, we were in compliance with the financial covenant. Additional information regarding our indebtedness, including information about availability under our 2027 Revolving Credit Facility and the principal repayment terms, interest rates, covenants, collateral and other key terms of our outstanding indebtedness, is included in Part II, Item 8, Note 8,\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into an amendment with our existing lenders under the Loan Agreement governing our Term Loan Facility and the 2027 Revolving Credit Facility that, among other changes, (a) permitted the Separation, (b) provided for the automatic release, in connection with the Separation, of guarantees and liens on collateral provided by Sandisk and Sandisk Technologies, Inc. under the Loan Agreement, (c) provided for",
