Our technology enables voice and multimedia collaborations across two-way radio, WiFi and public and private broadband networks. We are a global leader in the two-way radio category, including Project 25 (P25), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (“TETRA”) and Digital Mobile Radio (DMR), as well as other PCR solutions. We also deliver LTE solutions for public safety, government and commercial users, including devices operating in both low-band and mid-band frequencies, including Citizens’ Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) frequencies. We also offer High Frequency (HF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) communications technology to military, government and relief agency customers who require dynamic and mobile point-to-point voice communications in remote environments without the need for fixed infrastructure.\nWe believe that public safety agencies and enterprises continue to trust LMR communications systems and devices because they are purpose-built and designed for reliability, availability, security and resiliency to help keep people connected even during the most challenging conditions.\nBy extending our two-way radios with broadband data capabilities, we strive to provide our customers with greater functionality and multimedia access to the information and data they need in their workflows. Examples include application services such as GPS location to better protect lone workers, job dispatch to assign tasks and work orders and over-the-air programming to optimize device uptime. Our view is that complementary data applications such as these enable government, public safety and enterprise customers to work more efficiently and safely, while maintaining their mission-critical voice communications to remain connected and working in collaboration with others.\nPrimary sources of revenue for this technology come from selling devices and building communications systems, including the installation and integration of our infrastructure equipment within our customers’ technology environments. The LMR technology within the Products and Systems Integration segment represented 83% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nOur Video technology includes video management infrastructure, AI-powered security cameras including fixed and certain mobile video equipment, as well as on-premises and cloud-based access control solutions. We deploy video security and access control solutions to thousands of government and enterprise customers around the world, including schools, transportation systems, healthcare centers, public venues, commercial real estate, utilities, prisons, factories, casinos, airports, financial institutions, government facilities, state and local law enforcement agencies and retailers. Organizations such as these utilize video security and access control to verify critical events or incidents in real-time and to provide data to investigate an event or incident after it happens.\nOur view is that government and public safety customers are increasingly turning to video security technologies, including fixed and mobile cameras, to increase visibility, accountability and safety for communities and first responders alike.\nThe Video technology within the Products and Systems Integration segment represented 17% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nSoftware and Services Segment\nIn 2024, the segment’s net sales were $3.9 billion, representing 36% of our consolidated net sales.\nLMR Communications services include support and managed services, which offer a broad continuum of support for our customers. Support services include repair and replacement, technical support and preventative maintenance, and more advanced offerings such as system monitoring, software updates and cybersecurity services. Managed services range from partial to full operational support of customer-owned or Motorola Solutions-owned communications systems. Our customers’ systems often have multi-year or multi-decade lifespans that help drive demand for software upgrades, device and infrastructure refresh opportunities, as well as additional services to monitor, manage, maintain and secure these complex networks and solutions. We strive to deliver services to our customers that help improve performance across their systems, devices and applications for greater safety and productivity.\nGiven the mission-critical nature of our customers’ operational environments, we aim to design the LMR networks they rely on for availability, security and resiliency.

For example, body cameras and in-car video systems can be paired with either on-premises or cloud-based digital evidence management software and complementary command center products. Our cloud solutions are also sold as-a-service, available as single-year to multi-year hosted services, supporting our customers with upgrades and software enhancements to help ensure system performance and technological advancement.\nThe Video technology within the Software and Services segment represented 20% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nOur Command Center portfolio consists of cloud-native, on-premises and hybrid software solutions that support the complex process of the public safety workflow from \"911 call to case closure.\" From the moment a person contacts 911, an array of individuals engage to gather information, coordinate a response and manage the incident to resolution. These individuals include call takers who answer and triage 911 calls; dispatchers who route calls to police, fire and emergency medical services to manage the response; first responders who support on scene; intelligence analysts who support the incident; records and evidence specialists who preserve information and evidence; detectives who manage cases; crime analysts who identify patterns and accelerate investigations; and corrections officers who oversee jail and inmate management.\nTo help ensure that individuals within the public safety workflow can work as efficiently, effectively and safely as possible, we believe it’s important that individuals within enterprises and communities can communicate and collaborate directly with public safety agencies, particularly during emergencies. Our Command Center portfolio offers solutions that are designed to help community members, enterprises and public safety agencies work together and share information in an effort to help prevent critical events from escalating and better inform an emergency response when an incident unfolds.\nOur Command Center software is designed to support an emergency response. In the 911 communications center, we offer call-taking and management software (including multimedia communication capabilities and AI-powered call transcription and language translation), and voice and computer-aided dispatch software to assign first responders to incidents. For emergency management teams, we offer mass notification and alerting (including panic button mobile applications), and incident collaboration software that aids in coordinating a multi-disciplinary response. In the field, we offer mobile applications that help first responders to collaborate with each other, remain connected to the information they need, manage an incident, capture critical information to support investigations, and remotely file reports. For information and support services teams, we offer integrated records and evidence management software, as well as solutions for managing tips and publishing crime maps to aid community engagement. For intelligence and investigations teams, we offer software that can unify voice, video and data in order to increase situational awareness from a single map-based view during a real-time incident response, and investigative tools to help uncover connections across records to generate leads and help close cases. For enterprises, we provide incident management and business resilience solutions that help secure people and facilities, as well as share information with public safety when an incident necessitates it.\nAnother area of public safety evolution is the increasing adoption of Next Generation 911 Core Services (“NGCS”), a group of products and services needed to create infrastructure connectivity in order to process a 911 call using Next Generation (“NG”) technology. The NG infrastructure is an Emergency Service IP Network (\"ESInet\"), which can carry voice, data and multimedia. ESInet enables 911 call takers at public safety answering points to respond to text, video and data. Our NGCS can be offered as a managed service and includes call routing, ESInet, location services, geographic information services, cybersecurity and our continuous communications network and security operations center dedicated to public safety.\nCommand Center also includes interoperability solutions that provide connectivity across LMR and broadband networks to help ensure that communication is not limited by coverage area, ",

Additionally, Command Center includes push-to-talk (\"PTT\") devices that deliver voice communications over LTE and Wi-Fi, and advanced back-end systems that enable and manage interoperable communications, capable of scaling from small enterprises to nationwide cellular networks. For example, a two-way radio network can connect with an LTE network, assisting individuals in communicating securely and more easily across technologies. These solutions can provide our public safety customers with the critical interoperability between multiple agencies' networks, facilitating a coordinated response.\nFinally, as the Command Center market continues to evolve from on-premises to hybrid and cloud technologies to improve their operations, we offer both cloud-native applications and cloud features that enhance on-premises applications. We believe this flexibility helps our customers to optimize their investments and enhance their systems with the technologies of their choice.\nThe Command Center technology within the Software and Services segment represented\nof the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\n2024 Financial Results\nNet sales were $10.8 billion in 2024 compared to $10.0 billion in 2023.\nOperating earnings were $2.7 billion in 2024 compared to $2.3 billion in 2023.\nNet earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. were $1.6 billion, or $9.23 per diluted common share in 2024, compared to earnings of $1.7 billion, or $9.93 per diluted common share in 2023.\nOur operating cash flow was $2.4 billion in 2024 compared to $2.0 billion in 2023.\nWe returned approximately $898 million of capital to shareholders, in the form of $654 million in dividends and $244 million in share repurchases in 2024. Additionally, we repurchased the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 1.75% senior convertible notes issued to Silver Lake Partners and scheduled to mature in 2024 (\"the Silver Lake Convertible Debt\"), for $1.59 billion in cash, inclusive of the conversion premium.\nWe increased our quarterly dividend by 11% to $1.09 per share in November 2024.\nWe ended 2024 with a backlog position of $14.7 billion, up $438 million compared to 2023.\nSegment Financial Highlights\nIn the Products and Systems Integration segment, net sales were $6.9 billion in 2024, an increase of $641 million, or 10%, compared to $6.2 billion in 2023. On a geographic basis, net sales increased in both the North America and International regions. Operating earnings were $1.7 billion in 2024, compared to $1.2 billion in 2023. Operating margins increased in 2024 to 24.3% from 19.9% in 2023 primarily due to higher sales and favorable mix, partially offset by higher employee incentive costs, including share-based compensation, higher expenses related to legal matters, including Hytera-related expenses, and higher expenses associated with acquired businesses.\nIn the Software and Services segment, net sales were $3.9 billion in 2024, an increase of $198 million, or 5%, compared to $3.7 billion in 2023. On a geographic basis, net sales increased in the North America region and decreased in the International region. Operating earnings were $1.0 billion in 2024, compared to $1.1 billion in 2023. Operating margins decreased in 2024 to 25.7% from 28.1% in 2023 primarily driven the revenue reduction on Airwave services in accordance with the Charge Control, higher employee incentive costs, including share-based compensation, higher expenses associated with acquired businesses and higher expenses related to legal matters, partially offset by higher sales and a reduction in intangible amortization expenses.\nU.K. Home Office Update\nIn October 2021, the Competition and Markets Authority (\"CMA\") opened a market investigation into the Mobile Radio Network Services market. This investigation included Airwave, our private mobile radio communications network that we acquired in 2016. Airwave provides mission-critical voice and data communications to emergency services and other agencies in Great Britain.\nIn 2023, the CMA imposed a legal order on Airwave which implemented a prospective price control on Airwave (the \"Charge Control\"). After the Competition Appeal Tribunal (\"CAT\") dismissed our appeal of the CMA's final decision, we appealed the CAT's judgment to the United Kingdom Court of Appeal. On January 30, 2025, the United Kingdom Court of Appeal denied our application for permission to appeal the CAT's judgment. Since August 1, 2023, revenue under the Airwave contract has been, and will continue to be, recognized in accordance with the Charge Control.\nOn March 13, 2024, we received a notice of contract extension (the “Deferred National Shutdown Notice”) from the Home Office of the United Kingdom (the \"Home Office\"). The Deferred National Shutdown Notice extends the “national shutdown target date” of the Airwave service from December 31, 2026 to December 31, 2029, at the Charge Control rates. Our backlog for Airwave services contracted with the Home Office through December 31, 2026 was previously reduced by $777 million to align with the Charge Control. In 2024, as a result of the Home Office's notice of a contract extension pursuant to their Deferred National Shutdown Notice, we recorded additional backlog of $748 million to reflect the incremental three years of services. On April 11, 2024, we filed proceedings in the U.K. High Court challenging the decision of the Home Office to issue the Deferred National Shutdown Notice as being in breach of applicable U.K. procurement and public law. The hearing on this matter has been set to commence on April 22, 2025. The backlog related to the incremental years of service contemplated in the Deferred National Shutdown Notice could change depending on the outcome of the proceedings.\nOn December 5, 2024, a proposed class representative filed a claim with the CAT to bring collective proceedings against us, alleging that users of Airwave services during the period January 1, 2020 through July 31, 2023 suffered financial harm as a result of the pricing in effect during such time (the \"Collective Proceeding\"). The initial stage of the Collective Proceeding will involve \"Certification\" of the claim by the CAT, which we expect to be heard in 2025.\nSoftware and Services\nProvider of control room software solutions.\n$22 million and share-based compensation of $4 million\nSoftware and Services\nProvider of cloud-based business continuity planning, operational resilience and critical event management software.\n$91 million and share-based compensation of $19 million\nSoftware and Services\nVideo Security and Access Control\nUnnamed vehicle location and management solutions business\nProvider of vehicle location and management solutions.\n$132 million and share-based compensation of $3 million\nProducts and Systems Integration\nVideo Security and Access Control\nProvider of specialized, long-range cameras.\nProducts and Systems Integration\nVideo Security and Access Control\nCreator of a multifunctional safety and security device.\n$170 million and share-based compensation of $5 million\nSoftware and Services\nProvider of mass notification and incident management services.\n$553 million and share-based compensation of $2 million\nProducts and Systems Integration\nProvider of radio coverage extension solutions.\nProducts and Systems Integration\nBarrett Communications\nProvider of specialized radio communications.\nProducts and Systems Integration\nVideo Security and Access Control\nProvider of ruggedized video security solutions.\n$23 million and share-based compensation o",
