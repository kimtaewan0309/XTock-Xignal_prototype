  "item1_clean": "ITEM 1 – BUSINESS\nNORTH AMERICA\nSales in our North America segment accounted for approximately 77 percent of our total sales in 2024. This segment serves residential and commercial end markets with a broad range of products including:\n. Our residential and commercial water heaters primarily come in sizes ranging from 40 to 80 gallon models, however, we also offer sizes as low as 2.5 gallon (point-of-use) and as high as 2,500 gallon products with varying efficiency ranges. We offer electric, natural gas and liquid propane tank-type models as well as tankless (gas and electric), heat pump and solar tank units. Typical applications for our water heaters include residences, restaurants, hotels, office buildings, laundries, car washes, schools and small businesses.\nOur residential and commercial boilers range in size from 45,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) to 6.0 million BTUs. Boilers are closed loop water heating systems used primarily for space heating or hydronic heating. Our boilers are primarily used in applications in commercial settings for hospitals, schools, hotels and other large commercial buildings while residential boilers are used in homes, apartments and condominiums.\nWater treatment products.\nWith the acquisition of Aquasana, Inc. (Aquasana) in 2016 we entered the water treatment market. We expanded our product offerings and geographic footprint with the acquisitions of Hague Quality Water International (Hague) in 2017, Water-Right, Inc. (Water-Right) in 2019, Master Water Conditioning Corporation (Master Water) in 2021, Atlantic Filter Corporation (Atlantic Filter) in 2022, Water Tec of Tucson, Inc (Water Tec) in 2023 and Impact Water Products (Impact) in 2024. Our water treatment products range from point-of-entry water softeners, solutions for problem well water, whole-home water filtration products and point-of-use carbon and reverse osmosis products. We also offer a comprehensive line of commercial water treatment and filtration products. Typical applications for our water treatment products include residences, restaurants, schools and offices.\nIn our North America segment, we also manufacture expansion tanks, commercial solar water heating systems, swimming pool and spa heaters, related products and parts.\nA significant portion of our North America sales is derived from the replacement of existing products.\nWe believe we are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in North America with a leading share in both the residential and commercial portions of the market. We expanded our presence in North America with our acquisition of Giant Factories, Inc. (Giant), a Canada-based manufacturer of residential and commercial water heaters, which we acquired in late 2021. In the commercial segments of the market for both water heating and space heating, we believe our comprehensive product lines and our high-efficiency products give us a competitive advantage. Our wholesale distribution channel, where we sell our products primarily under the A. O. Smith and State brands, includes approximately 900 independent wholesale plumbing distributors serving residential and commercial end markets. We also sell our residential water heaters through the retail and maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) channels. In the retail channel, our customers include four of the six largest national hardware and home center chains, including a long-standing exclusive relationship with Lowe’s where we sell A. O. Smith branded products.\nOur Lochinvar brand is one of the leading residential and commercial boiler brands in North America. Approximately 45 percent of Lochinvar branded sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 55 percent of Lochinvar branded sales consist primarily of boilers and related parts. Our commercial boiler distribution channel is primarily comprised of manufacturer representative firms with the remainder of our Lochinvar branded products being distributed through wholesale channels.\nIn our water treatment business we sell through a variety of channels. We sell our A. O. Smith branded water treatment products primarily through our water quality, dealer network and Amazon. Our Aquasana branded products are primarily sold directly to consumers through e-commerce channels. Our water softener products and problem well water solutions, which\ninclude the Hague, Water-Right, Master Water, Atlantic Filter, Impact, and Water Tec brands, are sold through water quality dealers and contractors. Our water softener products are also sold through home center retail chains.\nOur energy-efficient product offerings continue to be a sales driver for our business. Our condensing commercial water heaters and boilers continue to be an option for commercial customers looking for high-efficiency water and space heating with a short payback period through energy savings. We offer residential heat pumps, condensing tank-type and tankless water heaters in North America, as well as other higher efficiency water heating solutions to round out our energy-efficient product offerings. We recently launched our newly designed ADAPT condensing gas tankless water heater and VERITUS air source commercial heat pump water heater to align with greenhouse gas emission reduction trends across the U.S.\nWe sell our products in highly competitive markets. We compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design, reliability, quality of products and services, advanced technologies, energy efficiency, maintenance costs and price. Our principal water heating and boiler competitors in North America include Rheem, Bradford White, Rinnai, Aerco and Navien. Numerous other manufacturing companies also compete. Our principal water treatment competitors in the U.S. are Culligan, Kinetico, Pentair, Franklin Electric and Ecowater as well as numerous regional assemblers.\nREST OF WORLD\nSales in our Rest of World segment accounted for approximately 23 percent of our total sales in 2024, a majority of which were in China. We have operated in China for nearly 30 years. In that time, we have established A. O. Smith brand recognition in the residential and commercial markets. We manufacture and market residential water heater and water treatment products, primarily incorporating reverse osmosis technology, and commercial dispensing water treatment products. The Chinese water heater market is predominantly comprised of electric wall-hung, gas tankless, combi-boiler, heat pump and solar water heaters. We believe we are one of the market leaders of water heaters and reverse osmosis water treatment products to the residential market in China in dollar terms. We also design and market kitchen products (range hoods, cooktops, steam ovens, and dishwashers) and connected product technology in China.\nWe sell our products in approximately 9,400 points of sale in China, of which approximately 4,400 are retail outlets in tier one through tier three cities and approximately 1,600 exclusively sell our products. We also sell our products through e-commerce channels. Our primary competitors in China in the water heater market segment are Haier/Casarte, Midea/COLMO, and Rinnai. Our principal competitors in the water treatment market are Angel, Haier/Casarte, Midea/COLMO, Truliva, and Xiaomi.\nIn 2008, we established a sales office in India and began importing products specifically designed for India. We began manufacturing water heaters in India in 2010 and water treatment products in 2015. In 2024, we expanded our product offerings and geographic footprint with the acquisition of Pureit, a Unilever PLC business. Pureit offers a broad range of residential water purification solutions in India and other South Asian markets. We continue to increase our product offerings and sales in this country, primarily through wholesale, e-commerce and retail channels. Our primary competitors in India are Racold, Bajaj and Havells in the water heater market and Eureka Forbes and Kent in the water treatment market.\nWe also sell water heaters in the European, Middle East, and Far East markets and water treatment products in Vietnam, all of which combined comprised less than 14 percent of total Rest of World sales in 2024.\nRAW MATERIALS\nRaw materials for our manufacturing operations, primarily consisting of steel, are generally available in adequate quantities. A portion of our customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in steel prices. There has been volatility in steel costs over the last several years. In addition tariffs could potentially increase volatility in steel and other input materials.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nTo improve our competitiveness by generating new products and processes, we conduct research and development at our Corporate Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, our Global Engineering Center in Nanjing, China, and our operating locations. Our total expenditures for research and development in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $101.7 million, $97.5 million and $89.0 million, respectively.\nPATENTS AND TRADEMARKS\nWe invest, own and use in our businesses various trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and licenses. We monitor our intellectual property for infringements. Although we believe our trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets, and licenses to constitute a valuable asset in the aggregate, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent on any\nsingle trademark, trade name, patent, trade secret, license or any group of related such rights. Our trade name is important with respect to our products, particularly in China, India, and North America.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nWe employed approximately 12,700 employees as of December 31, 2024 with approximately 7,200 in North America and 5,500 in Rest of World. A small portion of our workforce in the U.S. is represented by a labor union, while outside the U.S., we have employees in certain countries that are represented by employee representative organizations, such as an employee association, union, or works council.\nOur Guiding Principles and Values\n\nThe safety of our people is always at the forefront of what we do. We provide safety training in our production facilities, designed to empower our employees with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe choices and mitigate risks. In addition to traditional training, we use standardized signage and visual management throughout our facilities. Since 1954, we have annually awarded the Lloyd B. Smith President's Safety Award, which acknowledges an A. O. Smith facility that demonstrates the most improvement over one year in the area of workplace safety.\nBACKLOG\nDue to the short-cycle nature of our businesses, our operations do not normally sustain significant backlogs.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nOur operations, including the manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, advertising and sale of our products, are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. In the U.S., many of our products are regulated by the Department of Energy, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission. State and local governments, through laws, regulations, and building codes, also regulate our water heating and water treatment products. Whether at the federal, state, or local level, these laws are intended to improve energy efficiency and product safety, and protect public health and the environment. In recent years, a number of states and local authorities have proposed or implemented bans on gas-fired products in new construction in an effort to address greenhouse gas emissions. Similar laws and regulations have been adopted by government authorities in other countries in which we manufacture, distribute, and sell our products. We offer a complete line of water and hydronic heating products, including electric-powered water heaters and boilers, and we believe that",
  "item7_clean": "ITEM 7 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nOur company is comprised of two reporting segments: North America and Rest of World. Our Rest of World segment is primarily comprised of China, Europe and India. Both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas, heat pump and electric water heaters, boilers, tanks, and water treatment products. Both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective region of the world.\nWe continue to seek acquisitions that enable geographic growth, expand our core business, and establish adjacencies. On November 1, 2024, we acquired Pureit from Unilever for approximately $125 million, subject to customary adjustments. Pureit, a leading water purification business in South Asia, offers a broad range of residential water purification solutions and has annual sales of approximately USD $60 million. The acquisition fits squarely in our core capabilities and doubles our market penetration in the South Asia region. In the first quarter of 2024, we acquired Impact Water Products, a privately-held water treatment company. The acquisition supports our geographic expansion and growth strategy by expanding the West Coast presence of our water treatment business.\nAlso, we continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing product portfolio in high growth regions demonstrated by our previous introductions of kitchen products and connected product technologies in China. We also recently introduced our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless water heaters in North America. In addition, we are expanding our commercial water heater capacity in North America in preparation for the new efficiency rule for commercial water heaters that the Department of Energy (DOE) has adopted that will take effect in 2026.\nIn 2024, we recognized restructuring and impairment expenses of $17.6 million. In China, severance expenses of $11.3 million related to the right sizing of that business for current market conditions. The remaining $6.3 million related to the restructuring of our water treatment business in North America as a part of a profitability improvement strategy that prioritizes improving our cost structure and emphasizes our more profitable channels.\nIn our North America segment, we saw soft residential and commercial water heater order demand in the second half of 2024 after a strong first half of the year. We believe that a pre-buy ahead of our March 1st price increase pulled forward some demand into the first half of the year. We also believe our second half order demand was negatively impacted by our improved lead times. Those factors along with caution around softening of end market demand may have driven some customers to reduce their inventory levels. 2024 residential industry unit volumes were flat compared to the prior year and we project 2025 industry residential unit volumes will be flat as well. Proactive replacement has been above historical levels for the last several years and we project that will continue in 2025. We believe that new home construction remains in a deficit and will be flat compared to 2024. We anticipate that commercial water heater industry volumes will be approximately flat in 2025 after minimal growth in 2024 driven by growth in commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons which was offset by lower shipments of commercial gas water heaters. We expect our boilers sales to grow between three and five percent in 2025 compared to 2024 as we continue to benefit from the transition to higher efficiency boilers. We anticipate sales of our North America water treatment products will be between $235 million and $245 million, a year-over-year decrease of approximately five percent as we de-emphasize certain channels and focus on our more profitable channels.\nIn our Rest of World segment, after sales growth of three percent in the first half of the year, our full-year 2024 third-party sales in China declined six percent due to a further weakening of consumer demand in the second half of the year. In 2025, we project our third-party sales in China to decrease between five to eight percent in local currency compared to 2024 as we expect consumer demand softness will persist in 2025.\nCombining all of these factors, we expect our 2025 consolidated sales to be approximately flat to up two percent compared to 2024. Our guidance excludes the impacts from potential future acquisitions.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYears Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions)\nCost of products sold\nGross profit margin %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nRestructuring and impairment expenses\nOther (income) expense-net\nEarnings before provision for income taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\nOur sales in 2024 were $3,818.1 million, a decrease of $34.7 million compared to 2023 sales of $3,852.8 million. Our decrease in net sales was primarily driven by lower water heater volumes in North America, lower sales in China, and unfavorable currency translation of approximately $18 million due to the depreciation of foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar, which more than offset our higher boiler sales and pricing actions. Our 2024 and 2023 acquisitions of water treatment companies in North America added approximately $18 million of incremental net sales in 2024.\n\nOur 2024 gross profit margin of 38.1 percent decreased compared to 38.5 percent in 2023. The lower gross profit margin in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher production costs and operational inefficiencies associated with volume volatility, which outpaced our pricing actions.\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $739.3 million in 2024, or $11.9 million higher than in 2023. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher employee costs from increased wages and higher selling and advertising expenses to support our strategic initiatives.\nWe recognized $17.6 million of restructuring and impairment expenses during the year ended December 31, 2024. Of these expenses, $6.3 million was related to our water treatment business in the North America segment and was a result of a profitability improvement strategy that prioritizes improving our cost structure and emphasizes our more profitable channels. In the Rest of World segment, restructuring included severance costs in China of $11.3 million and was related to the right sizing of that business for current market conditions. Restructuring and impairment expenses in 2023 were $18.8 million, of which $15.7 million was recorded in the Rest of World segment and $3.1 million was recorded in Corporate Expense and related primarily to the sale of our business in Turkey.\nInterest expense was $6.7 million in 2024, compared to $12.0 million in 2023. The decrease in interest expense in 2024 compared to last year was primarily due to lower average debt levels.\nOther (income) expense, net was $8.5 million of income in 2024 compared to income of $6.9 million in 2023. The increase in other income was driven by lower foreign currency translation losses compared to last year, partially offset by lower interest income from lower average cash balances.\nOur effective income tax rate in 2024 was lower compared to 2023. The change in the effective income tax rate in 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the restructuring and impairment expense recorded in 2023 with no associated tax benefit. We estimate that our annual effective income tax rate for the full year of 2025 will be approximately 24 to 24.5 percent.\nWe are providing non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measures (adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), total segment earnings, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expense) that exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment expenses and pension settlement income. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the\nsection below. We believe that the measures of adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS, total segment earnings, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expense provide useful information to investors about our performance and allow management and our investors to better understand our performance between periods without regard to items that we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance or recurring in nature.\nNorth America Segment\nYears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)\nSales in our North America segment were $2,950.1 million in 2024, or $27.2 million higher than sales of $2,922.9 million in 2023. Compared to the prior year, pricing actions, higher boiler sales, and approximately $18 million of incremental net sales from our 2024 and 2023 acquisitions of water treatment companies primarily drove our net sales increase and more than offset lower water heater volumes.\nNorth America segment earnings were $707.5 million in 2024, or $19.2 million lower than segment earnings of $726.7 million in 2023. Segment margins were 24.0 percent and 24.9 percent in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Lower segment earnings and margins in 2024 were primarily due to lower water heater volumes, higher production costs and higher SG&A expenses associated with strategic investments that outpaced our pricing actions and higher boiler volumes. Segment earnings and margin in 2024 also included restructuring and impairment expenses of $6.3 million related to our water treatment business and a result of a profitability improvement strategy that prioritizes improving our cost structure and emphasizes our more profitable channels.\nAdjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2024 were $713.8 million and 24.2 percent, respectively, which excludes $6.3 million of pre-tax restructuring and impairment expenses. Adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2023 were $726.0 million and 24.8 percent, respectively, and exclude pension settlement income. We estimate our 2025 North America segment margin will be approximately 24.0 to 24.5 percent.\nRest of World Segment\nYears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)\nSales in our Rest of World segment were $918.6 million in 2024, or $38.3 million lower than sales of $956.9 million in 2023. Compared to the prior year, lower net sales in 2024 were primarily driven by decreased sales of our core water heating and water treatment products in China and included approximately $13 million of unfavorable currency translation. The decline in sales in 2024 was partially offset by higher volumes of kitchen products in China and included increased inter-segment sales of approximately $16 million related to our tankless water heaters manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. market.\nRest of World segment earnings were $64.5 million in 2024 and lower compared to $83.4 million in 2023. Segment margins were 7.0 percent and 8.7 percent in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Lower volumes of our core water heating and water treatment products and an unfavorable product mix and sales promotions in China primarily drove lower segment earnings and segment margin in 2024, partially offset by lower SG&A costs. Segment earnings and margin in 2024 and 2023 included restructuring and impairment expenses of $11.3 million and $15.7 million, respectively. Restructuring and impairment expenses in 2024 were severance costs in China related to the right sizing of that business for current market conditions, and 2023 expenses were primarily associated with the sale of our business in Turkey.\nAdjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2024 were $75.8 million and 8.3 percent, respectively. Adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2023 were $99.1 million and 10.4 percent, respectively. Adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2024 and 2023 exclude $11.3 million and $15.7 million of restructuring and impairment expenses, respectively. We estimate our 2025 Rest of World segment margin will be approximately eight to nine percent.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur working capital was $495.7 million at December 31, 2024, compared with $555.0 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in working capital was primarily related to lower cash and receivable balances, partially offset by higher inventory balances, lower accounts payable and lower payroll-related accruals. As of December 31, 2024, cash balances were negatively impacted by $6.6 million due to changes in foreign currency during the year. Cash and cash equivalents used to fund our operations are primarily generated through operating activities and our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany borrowing, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate capital resources among various entities. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations from certain foreign subsidiaries. In 2024, we repatriated approximately $90 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries and used the proceeds to pay down outstanding debt balances and fund acquisitions.\nYears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)\nCash provided by operating activities\nCash used in investing activities\nCash used in financing activities\nCash provided by operations in 2024 was $581.8 million and lower than $670.3 million in 2023, primarily as a result of higher incentive payments associated with record sales and profits earned in 2023, higher inventory balances and lower earnings, which more than offset lower trade receivable balances. Our free cash flow in 2024 and 2023 was $473.8 million and $597.7 million, respectively. We expect cash provided by operating activities to be between $600 million and $650 million in 2025. We expect free cash flow to be between $500 million and $550 million in 2025. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure described in more detail in the\nCapital expenditures totaled $108.0 million in 2024 compared with $72.6 million in 2023. Higher capital expenditures compared to the prior year were primarily due to our capacity expansion projects in Juarez, Mexico and McBee, South Carolina and our new engineering facility in Lebanon, Tennessee. We project that 2025 capital expenditures will be between $90 million and $100 million and full-year depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately $80 million.\nIn 2024, we renewed and amended our $500 million revolving credit facility (\"renewed facility\") which now expires on August 23, 2029. The renewed facility is with a group of nine banks and has an accordion provision that allows it to be increased up to $1 billion if certain conditions (including lender approval) are satisfied. Borrowing rates under the renewed facility are determined by our leverage ratio. The renewed facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants, a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test, and we were in compliance with the covenants as of December 31, 2024, and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future. The renewed facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings. At December 31, 2024, we had $30.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the renewed facility and an available borrowing capacity of $470.0 million. We believe the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flows will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future.\nOur total debt increased by $65.9 million in 2024 primarily due to borrowings associated with our share repurchase program and Pureit acquisition. Our leverage, as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization, was 9.3 percent at December 31, 2024, compared with 6.5 percent at December 31, 2023.\nIn 2024, our Board of D",
