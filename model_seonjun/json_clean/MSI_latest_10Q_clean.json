Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Company manages the business organizationally through two segments: “Products and Systems Integration” and “Software and Services.\" Within these segments the Company has three principal product lines in which the Company reports net sales: Mission Critical Networks (\"MCN\"), Video Security and Access Control (\"Video\") and Command Center. With the acquisition of Silvus Technologies Holdings Inc. (“Silvus”) in August 2025, the Company will now report net sales from its principal product lines by combining the former Land Mobile Radio Communications and newly acquired Silvus under the new technology name Mission Critical Networks. This name change does not require any financial information to be reclassified from previous periods.\nMCN: Infrastructure, mobile ad-hoc network technology (\"MANET\"), devices (two-way radio and broadband, including both for public safety and professional and commercial radio (PCR)) and software inclusive of installation and integration, and backed by managed and support services to help assure mission-critical communications availability, security and resiliency.\nVideo: Cameras (fixed, body-worn, in-vehicle), access control, sensors, infrastructure, video management, software and artificial intelligence (\"AI\")-powered analytics that help enable visibility to what's happening and bring attention to what’s important to help inform decisions and actions.\nCommand Center: Command center solutions and software applications, including AI-powered analytics, that unify voice, video, and data from public safety agencies, enterprises and the community, enabling a broad informational view of operations and incidents to help accelerate workflows and improve the accuracy and speed of decisions.\nThird Quarter Financial Results\nNet sales were $3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024.\nOperating earnings were $770 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $711 million in the third quarter of 2024.\nNet earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. was $562 million, or $3.33 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $562 million, or $3.29 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2024.\nOperating cash flow increased $260 million to $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2025 compared to $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2024.\nWe repurchased $664 million of common stock and paid $546 million in dividends in the first nine months of 2025.\nMacroeconomic Environment Update\nThe current global trade environment is complex and evolving. In early 2025, the U.S. initiated a series of trade actions which imposed new tariffs and increased existing tariffs on goods imported from various countries, contributing to a global trade landscape subject to evolving tariffs, import/export regulations, including restrictions around rare earth minerals, trade barriers and trade disputes. As a result, we continue to observe elevated volatility and uncertainty around the global supply chain.\nWe engage with global suppliers across a diverse network of locations around the world. We continue to work with our global supply base to mitigate our exposure to the risks to global reciprocal (and sectoral) tariffs and import/export regulations that have developed, and which may continue to develop, in order to ensure supply continues at levels in order to meet our current customer demand. As a result of the dynamic tariff environment, we have experienced increased costs on materials and components, which we have substantially mitigated during the year and for which we expect to continue to develop mitigation actions going forward.\nWe continue to see demand for our products and services supported by a multitude of funding sources. In July 2025, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (“OBBB”) was enacted into law by the President of the United States, which provided a number of changes, including funding over the next four years for border security, national security and other opportunities. We expect OBBB to provide an additional source of funding to our federal government customers over the four-year period available through OBBB.\nAs of October 1, 2025 the U.S. government entered into a shutdown, which, as of October 30, 2025, is still ongoing. A prolonged shutdown may impact our ability to ship and fulfill contracts for certain federal government customers, which may negatively impact our results of operations.\nProducts and Systems Integration\nSoftware and Services\nMission Critical Networks\nDesigner and developer of software-defined high-speed MANET technology.\n$4.4 billion and share-based compensation of $20 million\nSoftware and Services\nCreator of AI and voice-powered communication and digital workflow software for frontline workers.\n$174 million and share-based compensation of $5 million\nSoftware and Services\nProvider of cloud-native 911 solutions.\n$240 million and share-based compensation of $6 million\nSoftware and Services\nProvider of control room software solutions.\n$23 million and share-based compensation of $4 million\nSoftware and Services\nProvider of cloud-based business continuity planning, operational resilience and critical event management software.\n$92 million and share-based compensation of $19 million\nSoftware and Services\nVideo Security and Access Control\nUnnamed vehicle location and management solutions business\nProvider of vehicle location and management solutions.\n$132 million and share-based compensation of $3 million\nProducts and Systems Integration\nVideo Security and Access Control\nProvider of specialized, long-range cameras.\nResults of Operations\n\n* Percentages may not add due to rounding\nResults of Operations—Three months ended September 27, 2025 compared to three months ended September 28, 2024\nThe results of operations for the third quarter of 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. Historically, we have experienced higher revenues in the fourth quarter as compared to the rest of the quarters of our fiscal year as a result of the purchasing patterns of our customers.\nWe use the following U.S. GAAP key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by reporting segment, and to monitor and assess our results of operations:\nNet sales: a measure of our revenue for the current period.\nOperating earnings: a measure of our earnings from operations, before non-operating expenses and income taxes.\nOperating margins: a measure of our operating earnings as a percentage of total net sales.\nConsidered together, we believe these measures are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareholder value. A discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows.\nProducts and Systems Integration\nSoftware and Services\nProducts and Systems Integration\nSoftware and Services\nNet sales by region:\n\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended September 27, 2025 of 22% was higher than the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2024 of 19%, primarily due to non-deductible transaction costs related to the acquisition of Silvus, favorable U.S. return-to-provision adjustments from implementing a business initiative in 2024, and tax benefits recognized upon settlement of audits with taxing authorities in foreign jurisdictions in 2024, partially offset by higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation in 2025.\nOn July 4, 2025, the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" was enacted into law, introducing a broad range of changes to the U.S. corporate income tax framework. The legislation includes business provisions that impact our tax position, including tax cut extensions and modifications to the international tax framework and corporate income tax deductions. We have evaluated the effects of these changes on our income tax provision, income tax payable, and deferred tax asset balances, which are reflected in this quarter's results. As of the three months ended September 27, 2025, the 2025 impact of the enacted legislation on our tax position was not material. We will continue to recognize the effects of the legislation in accordance with the effective dates of the applicable provisions, and plan to continue to assess the ongoing impact of this legislation as further guidance is made available.\nResults of Operations—Nine months ended September 27, 2025 compared to Nine months ended September 28, 2024\nProducts and Systems Integration\nSoftware and Services\nProducts and Systems Integration\nSoftware and Services\nNet sales by region:\n\nWe had outstanding debt of $9.3 billion at September 27, 2025, of which $928 million was current. We had outstanding debt of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2024, of which $322 million was current.\nOn June 16, 2025, we issued $600 million of 4.85% senior notes due 2030, $500 million of 5.2% senior notes due 2032, $900 million of 5.55% senior notes due 2035. We recognized net proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion after debt issuance costs and discounts. The proceeds from these notes were used to fund a portion of the acquisition of Silvus.\nOn August 6, 2025 we borrowed $1.5 billion of senior delayed draw term loan facilities comprised of a $750 million 364-day facility and a $750 million term loan due 2028 to fund a portion of the acquisition of Silvus. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 364-Day Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Three-Year Term Loan Credit Agreement, each entered into on July 21, 2025. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of September 27, 2025. During the three months ended September 27, 2025, the weighted average interest rate of the 364-day facility and term loan due 2028 was 5.30% and 5.25%, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended Sep"
