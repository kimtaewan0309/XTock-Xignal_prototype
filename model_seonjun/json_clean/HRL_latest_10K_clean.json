  "item1_clean": "General Development of Business\nHormel Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation (collectively, the \"Company\", \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\"), was founded by George A. Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, as Geo. A. Hormel & Company. The Company started as a processor of meat and food products and continues in this line of business with emphasis on the manufacturing and distribution of branded, value-added consumer items. The Company builds on its founder’s legacy of innovation, quality, and integrity with focus on its purpose statement\nInspired People. Inspired Food.™\nThe Company has continually expanded its product portfolio through organic growth and acquisitions. Today, the Company is a global branded food company bringing some of the most trusted and iconic brands to tables across the globe with approximately $12 billion in annual revenue generated from more than 80 countries.\nDescription of Business\nThe Company currently operates with the following three operating and reportable segments: Retail, Foodservice, and International.\nThe Retail segment consists primarily of the processing, marketing, and sale of food products sold predominantly in the retail market in the United States. This segment also includes the results from the Company’s MegaMex Foods, LLC joint venture.\nThe Foodservice segment consists primarily of the processing, marketing, and sale of food products for foodservice, convenience store, and commercial customers located in the United States.\nThe International segment processes, markets, and sells Company products internationally. This segment also includes the results from the Company’s international joint ventures, international equity method investments, and international royalty arrangements.\nNet sales to unaffiliated customers, segment profit, and certain other financial information by segment are reported in Note P - Segment Reporting of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nProducts and Distribution\nThe Company develops, processes, and distributes a wide array of food products in a variety of markets and manufactures its products through various processing facilities and trusted co-manufacturers. The Company’s products primarily consist of meat, nuts, and other food products sold across multiple distribution channels, such as United States (U.S.) retail, U.S. foodservice, and internationally.\nThe Company sells its products in all 50 U.S. states. The Company’s products are sold through its sales personnel, who operate in assigned territories or in dedicated teams serving major customers and who are coordinated from sales offices predominately located in major U.S. cities. The sales team is also responsible for the product portfolio of MegaMex Foods, LLC (MegaMex Foods), a U.S. based Mexican food company, of which the Company owns a minority interest. Additionally, the Company utilizes independent brokers and distributors. Products are primarily distributed by common carrier.\nThe Company has a global presence within several major international markets, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Korea. Distribution of export sales to customers is by third party carriers, while the China and Brazil operations also rely on company-owned and operated delivery systems. The Company has licensed companies to manufacture various products internationally on a royalty basis. The Company also has minority positions in food companies in the Philippines (The Purefoods-Hormel Company, Inc., 40 percent holding) and Indonesia (PT Garudafood Putra Putri Jaya Tbk (Garudafood), approximately 30 percent holding).\nThe Company concentrates on the marketing and sale of branded, value-added food products. The principal raw materials used by the Company include pork, turkey, beef, chicken, and nuts. The Company takes what it believes is a balanced approach to sourcing its raw materials. To meet its needs for pork raw materials, the Company purchases hogs for the Austin, Minnesota processing facility, enters into long-term supply agreements for pork, and supplements this with spot market purchases of pork.\nThe majority of the turkeys needed to meet raw material requirements are raised by the Company. Production costs from raising turkeys are subject to fluctuations in grain prices and fuel costs. To manage input cost risks, the Company uses futures, swaps, and options contracts to hedge a portion of its anticipated purchases.\nThe Company also purchases raw materials from various suppliers. As the Company has shifted its focus toward a more value-added portfolio, it has become increasingly dependent on these suppliers to meet its raw material needs. Certain raw materials, such as cashews, are sourced internationally, which may cause additional risks to pricing and availability. The Company utilizes supply contracts and forward buying strategies in its effort to ensure an adequate supply and mitigate price fluctuations.\nThe Company’s employees are the driving force behind innovation, improvement, and success. As of October 27, 2024, the Company had approximately 20,000 active employees, with over 90 percent located within the U.S. Approximately 20 percent of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Contracts at two of the Company's facilities, covering approximately 300 employees, expire in the next fiscal year. The Company believes it has good relations with its workforce.\nTalent Acquisition, Development, and Retention\nHormel’s team members are the cornerstone of the Company and of the fulfillment of its purpose —\nInspired People. Inspired Food.™\nThe Company places great importance on the growth, development, and engagement of its team members.\nThe Company offers competitive compensation packages to its employees and provides a multitude of benefits, including medical, life and disability insurance, contributory and non-contributory retirement savings plans, free post-secondary tuition and tuition reimbursement programs, and two years of tuition-free community and technical college for U.S. employees’ dependent children. In fiscal 2024, the Company provided financial support for a new, third-party operated childcare center in Austin, Minnesota, providing a needed service for team members and the Austin community.\nThe Company believes investing in the education, training, and development of employees contributes to the overall success of the business. The Company provides learning opportunities for employees through various training courses, including instructor-led internal and external programs and on-the-job training.\nThe Company considers the tenure of its team members to be an important indicator of overall performance and is proud of its tenure figures. As of October 27, 2024, approximately 50 percent of the Company’s team members had five or more years of service, and the 37-person officer team had an average of 23 years of service.\nCreating an Inclusive Environment\nThe Company welcomes the diversity, unique skills, thoughts, and experiences of its team members, customers, and consumers. As of October 27, 2024, the Company’s U.S. workforce for majority-owned operations was made up of approximately 40 percent female and approximately 60 percent underrepresented minorities. The Company’s U.S. salaried employees for majority-owned operations as of October 27, 2024 was made up of approximately 35 percent female and approximately 25 percent underrepresented minorities. By fostering an inclusive culture, the Company enables every member of the workforce to leverage unique talents and high-performance standards to drive innovation and success.\nThe Company has twelve employee resource groups (ERGs) that support the Company’s mission to create a workplace where all people feel welcomed, respected, and valued. These employee-driven groups play a critical role in the Company’s efforts to create an inclusive environment and provide professional development and mentorship opportunities.\nSafety, Health, and Wellness\nThe Company’s dedicated corporate safety department develops and administers company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each employee and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards and comparable global requirements internationally. The corporate safety department also conducts regular audits of Company-owned production facilities to ensure compliance with Company safety policies. The Company conducts safety training for all team members and, during fiscal 2024, completed approximately 1,200 safety assessments each month.\nThe Company recognizes that team members perform best when they are healthy, and that optimal performance is necessary for the Company to achieve its key results. In addition to the health care benefits package, the Company’s Inspired Health program aims to cultivate and maintain a culture of health and wellness that is focused on encouraging and empowering team members to make healthy lifestyle choices through awareness, prevention, and positive health behavior changes. This program includes biometric screenings, on-site fitness centers and fitness center discounts, an online health university with robust information and resources, a tobacco cessation program, wellness challenges, and confidential health and wellness support.\nGovernmental Regulation and Environmental Matters\nThe Company’s operations are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies which oversee areas such as food safety, workforce mobility, environmental laws, animal welfare, financial and tax regulations, and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of the Company’s products. The Company believes it is in compliance with current laws and regulations and does not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on its capital expenditures, earnings, or\ncompetitive position. The Company continues to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and, while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect compliance to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. In addition to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has set aspirational goals to further improve its sustainability efforts and reduce its environmental impact. These goals are outlined in the Company’s 20 by 30 Challenge and address topics such as renewable sourcing, reducing organic waste and greenhouse gas emissions, supporting regenerative agriculture, packaging sustainability, and reducing food waste. The Company’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.\nSignificant Customers\nThe Company serves many customers throughout the world across various sales channels. Sales to the Company’s largest customer, Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (Walmart), accounted for approximately 16 percent of consolidated gross sales less returns and allowances during fiscal 2024. Walmart is a customer for the Company’s Retail and International segments. The Company’s top five customers collectively represented approximately 37 percent of consolidated gross sales less returns and allowances during fiscal 2024. The loss of one or more of the top customers in any of the reportable segments could have a material adverse effect upon such segment’s financial results.\nThe production and sale of meat and food products in the U.S. and internationally is highly competitive. The Company primarily competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey products as well as national and regional producers of other meat and protein sources, such as beef, chicken, fish, nuts, and plant-based proteins.\nAll operating segments compete on the basis of price, product quality and attributes, brand identification, breadth of product line, and customer servic",
  "item7_clean": "Cash and cash equivalents was comparable to the prior year, increasing $5 million during fiscal 2024. The Company repaid a portion of long-term debt by using existing cash on hand and the proceeds from new debt issued in fiscal 2024. Cash provided by operating activities has been sufficient to cover dividend payments and capital expenditures during fiscal 2024. The purchase of a minority interest in Garudafood was the primary driver of the decline in cash and cash equivalents in the prior year. Additional details related to significant drivers of cash flows are provided below.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities were largely impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nIn fiscal 2024, inventory decreased $95 million due to a better alignment of product levels with customer demand as well as less turkey and associated feed supplies. The $36 million decrease in fiscal 2023 was a result of strategic inventory management efforts implemented to address elevated inventory levels.\nPrepaid expenses and other assets decreased $13 million in fiscal 2024 compared to an increase of $69 million in fiscal 2023. This activity was primarily related to settlements associated with the Company’s hedging activities.\nIn fiscal 2024, accounts receivable was comparable to the prior year, decreasing $2 million. The $49 million decrease in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to timing of sales and more efficient collections.\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $27 million in fiscal 2024 related to the timing of payments which was partially offset by higher employee-related and promotional expenses. In fiscal 2023, accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $141 million related to the timing of payments and lower promotional and incentive compensation expenses.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nCapital expenditures were $256 million and $270 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The most notable projects in fiscal 2024 were investments for capacity expansions in Barron, Wisconsin and at the Jiaxing, China, facility. Significant projects for fiscal 2023 included investments in a new production line for the\nSPAM\nfamily of products in Dubuque, Iowa, the initial phases of the transition from harvest to value-added capacity in Barron, Wisconsin, wastewater infrastructure in Austin, Minnesota, and pepperoni capacity in Omaha, Nebraska.\nIn fiscal 2023, the Company purchased a minority interest in Garudafood for $426 million.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nThe Company paid $950 million of its senior unsecured notes upon maturity on June 3, 2024.\nProceeds from the issuance of long-term debt were $498 million during fiscal 2024. The Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million due March 2027.\nCash dividends paid to the Company’s shareholders are an ongoing financing activity for the Company with payments totaling $615 million in fiscal 2024 and $593 million in fiscal 2023.

The Company maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy and uses a waterfall approach, which focuses first on core uses of cash, such as capital expenditures to maintain facilities, dividend returns to investors, mandatory debt repayments, and fulfillment of pension obligations. Next, the Company looks to strategic items in support of growth initiatives, such as other capital projects, acquisitions, additional dividend increases, and working capital investments. Finally, the Company evaluates opportunistic uses, including incremental debt repayment and share repurchases.\nThe Company believes its anticipated income from operations, cash on hand, borrowing capacity under the current unsecured revolving credit facility, and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet all short-term and long-term commitments. The Company continues to look for opportunities to make investments and acquisitions that align with its strategic priorities. The Company has multiple sources of liquidity to complete such investments and acquisitions. For example, the Company’s historic ability to leverage its balance sheet through the issuance of debt has provided the flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities.\nThe Company remains committed to providing returns to investors through cash dividends. The Company has paid 385 consecutive quarterly dividends since becoming a public company in 1928. The Board of Directors approved an increased annual dividend rate for fiscal 2025, raising it to $1.16 per share from $1.13 per share, representing the 59th consecutive annual dividend increase.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures are allocated to required maintenance and growth opportunities based on the needs of the business. Capital expenditures supporting growth opportunities in fiscal 2025 are expected to focus on projects related to value-added capacity, infrastructure, and new technology. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 are estimated to be $275 million to $300 million.\nAs of October 27, 2024, the Company’s outstanding debt included $2.9 billion of fixed rate unsecured senior notes due in fiscal 2027, 2028, 2030, and 2051 with interest payable semi-annually.

On March 8, 2024, the Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. These proceeds were used, along with cash on hand, to repay $950 million in senior unsecured notes which matured on June 3, 2024. See Note L - Long-term Debt and Other Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAs a source of short-term financing, the Company maintains a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The maximum commitment under this credit facility may be further increased by $375 million, generally by mutual agreement of the lenders and the Company, subject to certain customary conditions. Funds drawn from this facility may be used by the Company for general corporate purposes, which may include repaying existing debt, funding acquisitions, and for working capital or other general purposes. The lending commitments under the facility are scheduled to expire on May 6, 2026, at which time the Company will be required to pay in full all obligations then outstanding. As of October 27, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings from this facility.\nThe Company’s debt agreements contain customary terms and conditions including representations, warranties, and covenants. These debt covenants limit the ability of the Company to, among other things, incur debt for borrowed money secured by certain liens, or engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions, and the covenants require the Company to maintain certain consolidated leverage ratios. As of October 27, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants in its debt agreements and expects to maintain compliance in the future.\nCash Held by International Subsidiaries\nAs of October 27, 2024, the Company’s international subsidiaries held $225 million of cash and cash equivalents.

The standby letters of credit are primarily related to the Company’s self-insured workers' compensation programs. This amount includes revocable standby letters of credit totaling $2.7 million for obligations of an affiliated party that may arise under workers' compensation claims. Letters of credit are not reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that can have a meaningful effect on the reporting of consolidated financial statements. See Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCritical accounting estimates are defined as those reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes the following are its critical accounting estimates:\nThe Company promotes products through consumer incentives and trade promotions. These promotional programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, slotting fees, coupons, rebates, and in-store display incentives. Customer trade promotion and consumer incentive activities are recorded as a reduction to revenue and a corresponding accrued liability based on amounts estimated as variable consideration.\nJudgments and Uncertainties:\nThe Company estimates variable consideration associated with promotional programs using the expected value method to determine the total expected consideration. Estimating variable consideration requires judgment and is based largely on an assessment of anticipated performance informed by historical experience, expected participation, and current market trends.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change:\nThe liability relating to these promotional activities is based on a review of the outstanding contracts for which performance has taken place but which remain unpaid. As of October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, the Company's accrued trade promotion liabilities were $81.8 million and $64.1 million, respectively.\nThe Company records income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting. Deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law. Changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur.\nJudgments and Uncertainties:\nThe Company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change:\nWhile the Company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the Company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination, based on its technical merits. The position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. A change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. As of October 27, 2024, the Company had $20.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, recorded in Other Long-term Liabilities.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include trade names obtained through business acquisitions which are originally recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is the residual after allocating the purchase price to net assets acquired and is allocated across the Company’s reporting units: Retail, Foodservice, and International. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the carrying value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value, it is considered impaired which requires a reduction to earnings. See Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Company’s procedures.\nJudgments and Uncertainties:\nDetermining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating the fair value of the Company’s goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment testing requires significant judgment. Indefinite-lived trade names are evaluated for impairment using an income approach utilizing the relief from royalty method. Significant assumptions include royalty rate, annual projected revenue, discount rate, and estimated long-term growth rate. Estimating the fair value of goodwill reporting units using the discounted cash flow model requires management to make assumptions and projections of future cash flows, revenues, earnings, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and",
