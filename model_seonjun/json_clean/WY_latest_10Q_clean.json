MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)\nNOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains statements concerning our future results and performance that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, without limitation, statements relating to: our expected future financial and operating performance; our plans, strategies, intentions and expectations; our capital structure and the sufficiency of our liquidity position to meet future cash requirements; our cash dividend framework, including our target percentage return to shareholders of Adjusted Funds Available for Distribution, including expected supplemental cash dividends and/or future share repurchases; future compliance with covenants in our debt agreements; our expectations concerning our contingent liabilities and the sufficiency of related reserves and accruals including, but not limited to, cost estimates of future litigation and environmental remediation; our provision for income taxes; expected capital expenditures; the expected cost and timing of the completion of a new wood products manufacturing facility; estimated returns on pension plan assets; expected market and general economic conditions, including related influencing factors such as the trajectory of U.S. housing construction activity, repair and remodel activity, inflation trends and interest rates and the potential impacts of U.S. trade policy; our expectations about our future opportunities in emerging carbon credit and carbon capture and storage markets; assumptions used in valuing incentive compensation and related expense and the occurrence and timing of the closing of an announced timberland divestiture transaction.\nForward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often involve use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “committed,” \"continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “foreseeable,” “maintain,” “may,” \"plan,\" “potential,” and “will,” or similar words or terminology. They may use the positive, negative or another variation of those and similar words. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or performance. The realization of our expectations and the accuracy of our assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. There is no guarantee that any of the events anticipated by our forward-looking statements will occur. If any of the events occur, there is no guarantee what effect it will have on our operations, cash flows, or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements after the date of this report. The factors listed below, as well as other factors not described herein because they are not currently known to us or we currently judge them to be immaterial, may cause our actual results to differ significantly from our forward-looking statements:\n\nchanges in accounting principles and\nother risks and uncertainties described in this report under\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)\nIt is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties that might affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and, consequently, our descriptions of such risks and uncertainties should not be considered exhaustive. There is no guarantee that any of the events anticipated by these forward-looking statements will occur, and if any of the events do occur, there is no guarantee what effect they will have on the company's business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and future prospects.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn reviewing our results of operations, it is important to understand these terms:\nSales realizations for Timberlands and Wood Products refer to net selling prices. This includes selling price plus freight, minus normal sales deductions. Real Estate transactions are presented at the contract sales price before commissions and closing costs, net of any credits.\nNet contribution (charge) to earnings does not include interest expense or income taxes.\n\nThe discussion below includes a number of publicly available data points, many of which are obtained from U.S. federal government institutions. Due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, availability of these data points is limited to August 2025. All other data points are updated through third quarter 2025.\nHome sales and building activity continues to moderate in response to elevated mortgage interest rates, reduced affordability and lower consumer confidence. While overall housing inventory remains historically low across many markets, there has been some increase in unsold new and existing single-family units. On a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, housing starts as of the end of August 2025 averaged 1.4 million units, a 1.0 percent increase from second quarter 2025. Single-family starts averaged 924 thousand units as of the end of August 2025, a 1.8 percent decrease from second quarter 2025. Multi-family starts averaged 445 thousand units as of the end of August 2025, a 7.5 percent increase from second quarter 2025. Single-family construction is the primary driver for our business as compared to multi-family due to the amount of wood products used. Sales of newly built single-family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 732 thousand units through August 2025, a 9.3 percent increase from second quarter 2025, driven by builder incentives and moderate relief in mortgage rates. Notwithstanding current macroeconomic uncertainty and potential impacts to housing demand, we expect a favorable U.S. housing construction market over the medium to long-term, supported by strong demographics in the key home buying age cohorts and a decade of under building.\nRepair and remodeling expenditures decreased 0.9 percent from second quarter 2025 to the end of August 2025, according to the Census Bureau Advance Retail Spending report. While there continues to be steady demand due to growing home equity and the lock-in effect of lower mortgage rates compared to current rates, many homeowners have been more cautious in discretionary spending on large projects. Recent softness has been reflected in both the do-it-yourself (DIY) and professionally built segments, largely driven by lower consumer confidence, higher interest rates and general uncertainty around the trajectory of the economy. Slower sales of existing homes have also contributed to more subdued activity. Over the longer term, we expect this sector to return to historical growth trends driven by recent deferrals in repair and remodel spending, higher levels of home equity and an aging U.S. housing stock, with a median age of 45 years.\nIn U.S. wood product markets, softer end use demand and steady supply have led to significant price weakness in commodity products. In third quarter 2025, the Random Lengths Framing Lumber Composite price averaged $411/MBF and the OSB Composite averaged $245/MSF. Over the course of third quarter 2025, composite prices for lumber decreased from $422/MBF to $367/MBF and composite prices for OSB decreased from $262/MSF to $237/MSF, both near multi-decade lows on an inflation-adjusted basis. The Framing Lumber Composite began third quarter 2025 on a slight upward trajectory, largely supported by improving Canadian spruce-pine-fir (SPF) pricing and broader concerns around increases in AD/CVD on softwood lumber from Canada, which moved significantly higher in August. As the quarter progressed, demand softened seasonally, and buyer sentiment turned\n\nNote 8: Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit\nfor further information.\nInterest Rate Swap Hedging Relationship\nDuring third quarter 2025, we entered into interest rate swaps with the risk management objective of managing exposure to interest rate volatility by converting variable rate debt obligations associated with our new $800 million term loan into fixed rate payments. The interest rate swaps provide the right to make fixed rate payments to the counterparty in exchange for variable, SOFR-based payments on a monthly settlement schedule. As of September 30, 2025, our interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million were designated as cash flow hedging instruments of variable, SOFR-based interest payments on our $800 million term loan. No comparable activity was present as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nNote 9: Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nfor further information.\n\nthe effect of general economic conditions, including employment rates, interest rates, inflation rates, housing starts, general availability and cost of financing for home mortgages and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar;\nmarket demand for the company's products, including market demand for our timberland properties with higher and better uses, which is related to, among other factors, the strength of the various U.S. business segments and U.S. and international economic conditions;\nchanges in currency exchange rates, particularly the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan and the Canadian dollar, and the relative value of the euro to the yen;\nU.S. trade policy and resulting restrictions on international trade and tariffs imposed on imports or exports;\nthe availability and cost of shipping and transportation;\neconomic activity in Asia, especially Japan and China;\nperfor"
