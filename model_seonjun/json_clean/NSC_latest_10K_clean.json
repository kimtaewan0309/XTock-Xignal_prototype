  "item1_clean": "There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers. Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products. Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods, and work-in-progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.\nOur primary rail competitor is CSX Corporation (CSX); both we and CSX operate throughout much of the same territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory. We also compete with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage, sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.\n\nIn addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, our railroads are subject to regulation by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB). The STB has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines. The STB has jurisdiction to determine whether we are “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on the results of the prior year. A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital. This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement. The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.\n\nThe relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, included exemption from STB regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar shipments, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing. Further, all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract. Approximately 90% of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts; the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates.\n\nOur talent strategy for management employees is essential to attracting strong candidates in a competitive talent environment. We evaluate the effectiveness of that strategy by studying market trends, benchmarking the attractiveness of our employee value proposition, maintaining a competitive compensation package, and analyzing retention data.\nWe also focus on driving employee engagement, which is key to increasing employee productivity, retention, and safety. We take a data-centric approach, including the use of periodic surveys among employees, to identify new initiatives that will help boost engagement and drive business results.\nEmployee Development and Training\n\nSafety is a core value at Norfolk Southern. We are dedicated to providing employees with a safe workplace and the knowledge and tools they need to work safely and return home safely every day. Our commitment to an injury-free workplace is outlined in our Risk Reduction Program, which focuses on safety policies and procedures, risk-based hazard management program, safety outreach and communications, technology analysis and implementation, and collaboration with craft employees. Our safety programs, practices, and messaging further reinforce the importance of working safely including the imperative to speak up with ideas and concerns as well as reinforce the universal authority to stop work if ever unsure or detect a risk that is not adequately safeguarded. We measure employee safety performance through internal metrics such as accidents, injuries, and serious injuries per 200,000 employee-hours. We also use metrics established by the Federal Railroad\nK8\nAdministration (FRA) to measure FRA-reportable accidents per million train miles and injuries per 200,000 employee-hours. Given that safety continues to be a top priority, and the importance of safety among our workforce and to our business, our Board of Directors (Board) has a standing Safety Committee that, among other duties, reviews, monitors, and evaluates our compliance with our safety programs and practices.\nCraft Workforce Levels and Productivity\n\nCertain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable railroads to compete more effectively in specific markets.\nSECURITY OF OPERATIONS\n– We continue to enhance the security of our rail system. Our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001. The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as the risk of terrorist, extremist, or seriously disruptive cyber-attack increases or decreases. The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas: (1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police. All of our Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change.\nOur security plan also complies with DOT security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials. As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and is integrated into hazardous material training programs. Additionally, location-specific security plans are in place for rail corridors in certain metropolitan areas referred to as High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA). Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in a HTUA by: (1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3) reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with federal, state, local, and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest.\nWe also operate four facilities that are under U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Maritime Security Regulations. With respect to these facilities, each facility’s security plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and remains subject to inspection by the USCG.\nK10\nAdditionally, we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the DHS, the TSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FRA, the USCG, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Defense, and various state Homeland Security offices.\nIn 2024, through the Norfolk Southern Operation Awareness and Response Program as well as participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response Program, we provided rail accident response training to more than 5,500 emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel, utilizing a combination of online training and face-to-face training sessions as well as the Norfolk Southern Safety Train. We also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Center.\nWe also continually evaluate ourselves for appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery planning, with test scenarios that include cybersecurity attacks. Our risk-based information security program helps ensure our defenses and resources are aligned to address the most likely and most damaging potential attacks, to provide support for our organizational mission and operational objectives, and to keep us in the best position to detect, mitigate, and recover from a wide variety of potential attacks in a timely fashion.\n\nMaintaining appropriate headcount levels for our craft-employee workforce is critical to our on-time and consistent delivery of customers’ goods and operational efficiency goals. We manage this human capital metric through forecasting tools designed to ensure the optimal level of staffing to meet business demands. We measure and monitor employee productivity based on various factors, including gross ton miles per train and engine employee.\nAttracting and Retaining Management Employees\n\nOur intermodal commodity group consists of shipments moving in domestic and international containers and trailers. These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, premium customers, and asset-owning companies. In 2024, we handled 4.1 million intermodal units, which accounted for 25% of our total railway operating revenues.\n\nOur merchandise commodity group is composed of four groupings:\nAgriculture, forest and consumer products includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, livestock and poultry feed, food products, food oils, flour, sweeteners, ethanol, lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, beverages, and canned goods.\nChemicals includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products (including crude oil), chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes, sand, and natural gas liquids.\nMetals and construction includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, minerals, clay, transportation equipment, and items for the U.S. military.\nAutomotive includes finished motor vehicles and automotive parts.\nK5\nIn 2024, we handled 2.3 million merchandise carloads, which accounted for 62% of our total railway operating revenues.\nINTERMODAL\n\nCoal revenues accounted for 13% of our total railway operating revenues in 2024. We handled 76.7 million tons, or 0.7 million carloads, most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins with the balance from major western coal basins received via the Memphis and Chicago gateways. Our coal franchise supports the electric generation market, directly serving 18 coal-fired power plants, as well as the export, domestic metallurgical, and industrial markets, primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including various terminals on the Ohio River, at Lamberts Point in Norfolk, Virginia, at the Port of Baltimore, and on Lake Erie.\nFREIGHT RATES\n\nOur system reaches many manufacturing plants, electric generating facilities, mines, distribution centers, transload facilities, and other businesses located in our service area.\nCorridors with heaviest freight volume:\nNew York City area to Chicago (via Allentown and Pittsburgh)\nChicago to Macon (via Cincinnati, Chattanooga, and Atlanta)\nCentral Ohio to Norfolk (via Columbus and Roanoke)\nCleveland to Kansas City\nBirmingham to Meridian\nMemphis to Chattanooga\nK4\nThe miles operated, which include an exclusive operating agreement for trackage rights over property owned by North Carolina Railroad Company, were as follows:\n\nK9\nEfforts have been made over the past several years to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry, and such efforts may continue in 2025. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 substantially balanced the interests of shippers and rail carriers, and encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete f",
  "item7_clean": "($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nRailway operating expenses\nIncome from railway operations\nDiluted earnings per share\nRailway operating ratio (percent)\nOn an adjusted basis, income from railway operations in 2024 increased due to lower adjusted railway operating expenses, with lower fuel prices, decreased costs of purchased services, and lower other expenses contributing significantly to the overall decline, and more than offsetting the decline in revenue. Lower other income-net and higher interest expense on debt contributed to net income and diluted earnings per share that were only up slightly compared to the prior year.\nIn 2023, on a non-GAAP basis excluding the impact of direct costs resulting from the Incident, income from railway operations decreased due to lower railway operating revenues and higher railway operating expenses. Railway operating revenues declined due to decreased fuel surcharge revenue, decreased intermodal storage revenues, and lower volume, partially offset by increased pricing and favorable mix compared to the prior year. Railway operating expenses increased due to inflationary pressures, investments in operational resiliency, and higher service-related costs, partially offset by lower fuel prices.\nK27\nDETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRailway Operating Revenues\nThe following tables present a three-year comparison of revenues, volumes (units), and average revenue per unit by commodity group.\nAgriculture, forest and consumer\nMetals and construction\nAgriculture, forest and consumer\nMetals and construction\nAgriculture, forest and consumer\nMetals and construction\nK28\nRevenues decreased $33 million in 2024 and $589 million in 2023 compared to the prior years. Revenues decreased in 2024 as a result of lower average revenue per unit, driven by lower fuel surcharge revenue, adverse mix, and decreased pricing, partially offset by higher volume. Revenues declined in 2023 as a result of lower average revenue per unit, driven by decreases in fuel surcharge and intermodal storage revenues, and volume declines.\nThe table below reflects the components of the revenue change by major commodity group.\n\nCompensation and benefits\nRestructuring and other charges\nEastern Ohio incident\nIn 2024, the decline in railway operating expenses reflects lower net expenses related to the Eastern Ohio incident (Note 18), higher gains on operating property sales, including certain gains on railway line sales (Note 8), and lower fuel prices, partially offset by restructuring and other charges (Note 3), and increased depreciation on our higher asset base. In 2023, expenses increased as we incurred $1.1 billion of costs related to environmental matters and legal proceedings resulting from the Incident (Note 18). Additionally, railway operating expenses reflected higher costs due to inflationary pressures, investments in operational resiliency, and higher service-related costs. Partially offsetting these increases were the impacts of lower fuel prices and the absence of retroactive wage increases recorded in 2022.\nCompensation and benefits\nincreased in 2024, reflecting changes in:\npay rates (up $91 million),\nincentive and stock-based compensation (up $56 million),\novertime (down $37 million),\nemployee activity levels (down $68 million), and\nother (down $38 million).\nIn 2023, compensation and benefits increased, a result of changes in:\nemployee activity levels (up $138 million),\npay rates (up $86 million),\novertime (up $9 million),\nincentive and stock-based compensation (down $30 million), and\nother (down $5 million).\nOur employment averaged 20,200 in 2024, compared with 20,300 in 2023, and 18,900 in 2022.\nK32\nincludes the costs of services purchased from external vendors and contractors, including the net costs of operating joint facilities with other railroads. The decrease in purchased services in 2024 was due to lower lease costs and declines in technology-related and operational expenses, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses and Conrail-related activity. The increase in purchased services in 2023 was due to higher technology-related costs, increased operational and transportation expenses, and higher engineering activity.\n, which includes our cost of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment, increased in both periods. In 2024, the increase was due to increased automotive and intermodal equipment expenses as a result of higher volumes. In 2023, the increase was due to increased intermodal equipment expenses, higher freight car lease costs, and decreased equity in TTX Company's (TTX) earnings.\nexpense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, decreased in both 2024 and 2023. The decrease in both periods was due to lower locomotive fuel prices (down 15% in 2024 and 20% in 2023), which decreased fuel expense by $159 million and $275 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Locomotive fuel consumption was down in 2024 and nearly flat in 2023 compared to prior periods. We consumed 373 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2024, compared with 377 million gallons in 2023 and 376 million gallons in 2022.\nexpense increased in both periods compared to the prior years, reflecting reinvestment in our infrastructure, rolling stock, and technology.\nexpense increased in both 2024 and 2023. The increase in 2024 was due to higher freight car repairs expense, partially offset by lower locomotive materials spending. The increase in 2023 was due to increased locomotive, freight car, and track materials costs.\nexpense includes costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters. Claims expense decreased in both 2024 and 2023 compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2024 is the result of lower personal injury case development and declines in lading and property damage expenses. These were partially offset by the absence of a prior-year claims-related recovery and higher insurance costs. The decrease in 2023 was primarily the result of lower personal injury case development, lower costs related to environmental remediation matters unrelated to the Incident, and a claims-related recovery.\nexpense decreased in 2024 primarily due to increased gains from operating property sales, lower non-income-based taxes, and lower relocation and travel-related expenses. Gains from operating property sales includes $433 million of gains on the sale of railway lines in the states of Virginia and North Carolina. These transactions are described further in Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to lower gains from operating property sales and increased travel-related expenses. Gains from operating property sales amounted to $490 million, $43 million, and $76 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nRestructuring and other charges\nIn 2024, we recorded $183 million in restructuring and other charges. During the year, we completed voluntary and involuntary separation programs that reduced our management workforce. Additionally, we ceased development of certain technology projects that had not been placed into service. We also wrote down certain specialized equipment to its net realizable value, reflecting the planned disposition of that asset class. Additionally, we incurred costs associated the appointment of our chief operating officer. See Notes 3 and 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nK33\nEastern Ohio incident\nDuring 2024, we incurred net expenses of $325 million associated with the Incident, including additional costs associated with environmental matters and legal proceedings. The total amount recorded in 2024 is net of $650 million of insurance recoveries, resulting from claims made under our insurance policies in effect at the time of the Incident. During 2023, we recorded $1.1 billion for costs primarily associated with environmental matters and legal proceedings. We recorded $101 million of recoveries from claims made under our insurance policies, which are included in the total amount recorded in 2023. Our cash expenditures attributable to the Incident, net of insurance proceeds received, were $119 million and $652 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and which are presented in “Net cash provided by operating activities” on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For further details regarding the Incident, see Note 18 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther income – net decreased in 2024 but increased in 2023. The decrease in 2024 reflects costs associated with shareholder matters, lower returns on corporate-owned life insurance (COLI), and higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense, partially offset by a $20 million curtailment gain on our other postretirement benefit plan as a result of our voluntary and involuntary separation programs (Note 3). The increase in 2023 was the result of higher net returns on COLI and increased interest income, partially offset by lower gains from non-operating property sales.\n\nIn 2024, we executed on various initiatives to operate our network more safely and efficiently, better serve our customers, and increase productivity in order to deliver improved financial performance. We enhanced our executive leadership team and continued to execute on our strategy of providing high-quality service to our customers to enable smart, sustainable growth and delivering on productivity initiatives. Additionally, we executed on several strategic initiatives, including the purchase of the Cincinnati Southern Railway, sales of certain railway lines, and completion of targeted rationalization and restructuring efforts, to further advance our organizational objectives. Furthermore, we continued our efforts related to the Eastern Ohio Incident (as defined and further described in Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), including the pursuit of recoveries under our insurance programs.\nOur operational improvements during the year, while handling 5% higher volumes, helped drive improvements to income from railway operations, diluted earnings per share, and railway operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses). For the full year, we achieved an operating ratio of 66.4%, and an adjusted operating ratio of 65.8% (see our non-GAAP reconciliations beginning on page K26), both of which improved on a year-over-year basis. We remain committed to being a safe, productive, resilient, and efficient railroad with industry-competitive margins.\nSUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nRailway operating revenues\nRailway operating expenses\nIncome from railway operations\nDiluted earnings per share\nRailway operating ratio (percent)\nIncome from railway operations, net income and diluted earnings per share increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily as a result of lower railway operating expenses. The reduction in our operating expenses includes lower net expenses related to the Eastern Ohio Incident and $433 million of gains on the sale of railway lines. Railway operating revenues were slightly lower as decreased fuel surcharge revenue, an adverse mix of traffic, and decreased pricing were nearly offset by increased volumes. Our railway operating ratio improved to 66.4 percent.\nIncome from railway operations, net income and diluted earnings per share declined in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by expenses incurred with our response efforts to the Incident, lower railway operating revenues, and higher\nK25\nnon-Incident-related railway operating expenses. Railway operating revenues declined 5% due to lower average revenue per unit, the result of lower fuel surcharge revenue and decreased intermodal storage service revenues partially offset by favorable pricing and mix. Additionally, lower volumes contributed to the decline in revenues. Net expenses associated with the Incident for the year 2023 were $1.1 billion. In addition to costs resulting from the Incident, railway operating expenses increased due to inflationary pressures, investments in operational resiliency, and higher service-related costs, offset partially by lower fuel prices. The decline in net income and diluted earnings per share also reflects the absence of a prior year $136 million deferred tax benefit, a result of an enactment of a change in the corporate income tax rate in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2022. Railway operating ratio deteriorated to 76.5 percent.\nThe following tables adjust our 2024 and 2023 U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial results to exclude gains on railway line sales, restructuring and other charges (including the curtailment gain on our other postretirement benefit plan which is included in “Other income\nnet”), shareholder advisory costs, and a deferred income tax adjustment, all which occurred in 2024, as well as the effects of the Incident that were present in both years. The income tax effects of these non-GAAP adjustments were calculated based on the applicable tax rates to which the non-GAAP adjustments related. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making period-to-period comparisons by excluding these items. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation for 2024\n(GAAP)\nGains on Railway Line Sales\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nEastern Ohio Incident\nShareholder Advisory Costs\nDeferred Income Tax Adjustment\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nK26\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation for 2023\n(GAAP)\nEastern Ohio Incident\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nRailway operating expenses\nIncome from railway operations\nDiluted earnings per share\nRailway operating ratio (percent)\nIn the table below, references to 2024 and 2023 results and related comparisons use the adjusted, non-GAAP results from the reconciliations in the tables above.\nAdjusted 2024 (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted 2023 (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted 2024 (Non-GAAP) vs. Adjusted 2023 (Non-GAAP)\nAdjusted 2023 (Non-GAAP) vs. 2022\n\nWe manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating- rate debt instruments. At December 31, 2024, we have no outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations. Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a one-percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2024 and amounts to an increase of approximately $1.5 billion to the fair value of our debt at December 31, 2024. We consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1.\n\nApproximately 95% of our revenue base is covered by contracts that include negotiated fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge revenues totaled $962 million, $1.2 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The decline in fuel surcharge revenues in each period was primarily driven by fluctuations in fuel commodity prices.\nFor 2025, we expect that revenue will increase driven by higher volumes.\nMERCHANDISE\nrevenues increased in both 2024 and 2023 compared with the prior years.
