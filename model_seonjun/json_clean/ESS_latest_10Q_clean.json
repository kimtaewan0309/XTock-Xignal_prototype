The communities previously held in the BEX II co-investment, which was consolidated in 2024, are excluded from the table as of September 30, 2024 but included in the table as of September 30, 2025.\nMarket Considerations\nDomestic and international policy actions, including tariff and trade policy, as well as continuing geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts have the potential to trigger market uncertainty. The long-term impact of these developments on our company will largely depend on the impact on broader trends in job growth, inflation, the economy, and reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets.\nThe foregoing macroeconomic conditions have not negatively impacted the Company’s ability to access traditional funding sources which have been historically available to it. The Company is not at material risk of not meeting the covenants in its credit agreements and is able to timely service its debt and other obligations.\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nThe average financial occupancy for the Company’s 2025 Same-Property portfolio (stabilized properties consolidated by the Company for the quarters ended September 30, 2025 and 2024) was 96.1% and 96.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental income by total scheduled rental income. Actual rental income represents contractual rental income pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions. Total scheduled rental income represents the value of all apartment homes, with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents. The Company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant apartment home at its estimated market rate.\nMarket rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes. The Company may increase or decrease these rates based on a variety of factors, including overall supply and demand for housing, concentration of new apartment deliveries within the same submarket which can cause periodic disruption due to greater rental concessions to increase leasing velocity, and rental affordability. Financial occupancy may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates, and the Company’s calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy disclosed by other REITs.\nThe Company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes. The calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied apartment homes to estimated market rents for unoccupied apartment homes, and thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment homes excluding delinquency and concessions. For apartment home communities that are development properties in lease-up without stabilized occupancy figures, the Company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric. While an apartment home community is in the lease-up phase, the Company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property, which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives, and thus financial occupancy, which is based on contractual income, is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy.\nThe regional breakdown of the Company’s Same-Property portfolio for financial occupancy for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was as follows:\n\nSame-Property Revenues\nincreased by $37.3 million or 3.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 2.3% in average rental rates from $2,631 per apartment home for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to $2,692 per apartment home for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 0.6% of the increase was attributable to a decrease in delinquencies for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNon-Same Property Revenues\nincreased by $51.3 million or 42.3% to $172.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from $121.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of The Plaza, One Hundred Grand, ROEN Menlo Park, Revere Campbell, The Parc at Pruneyard, and the consolidation of Artizan in 2025, as well as ARLO Mountain View, Maxwell Sunnyvale, and Beaumont, along with the Company’s acquisition of its joint venture partner’s interests in the BEXAEW and BEX II portfolios, Patina at Midtown, and Century Towers in 2024. The increases were partially offset by the sale of Highridge, Essex Skyline, The Grand, and Fourth & U in 2025 and Hillsdale Garden in 2024.\nProperty operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes\nincreased by $19.2 million or 7.8% to $263.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $244.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to acquisitions in 2024 and 2025 identified in the Non-Same Property revenues section above and the increase of Same-Property operating expenses discussed below, partially offset by dispositions in 2024 and 2025. Same-Property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes, increased by $11.4 million or 5.1% to $236.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $225.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increases of $6.1 million in utilities expenses resulting from increases in trash removal, water and sewer costs and $3.4 million in personnel costs due to wage inflation.\nincreased by $10.5 million or 7.3% to $153.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $143.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to acquisitions in 2024 and 2025 identified in the Non-Same Property revenues section above and an estimated 2025 net aggregate increase in combined real estate taxes with increases in California partially offset by decreases in the Seattle Metro region.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nincreased by $22.5 million or 5.2% to $454.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $431.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to acquisitions\nin 2025 and 2024 identified in the Non-Same Property revenues section above. The increase was partially offset by dispositions in 2025 and 2024.\nGain on sale of real estate and land\nof $299.5 million was attributable to the dispositions of Highridge, Essex Skyline, The Grand and Fourth & U in 2025. There were no sales of real estate or land during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nincreased by $18.4 million or 10.6% to $192.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $174.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the issuance in March 2024 and August 2024 of $550.0 million senior unsecured notes due April 2034, the issuance in February 2025 of $400.0 million senior unsecured notes due April 2035, borrowing on the new $300.0 million unsecured term loan in June and September 2025, and increased borrowing on the two unsecured lines of credit and the commercial paper program which resulted in an increase in interest expense of $34.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. These increases to interest expense were partially offset by various debt that was paid off, matured, or due to regular principal amortization during and after the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the payoff of $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes due May 1, 2024 and $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2025, which resulted in a decrease in interest expense of $13.8 million for the third quarter of 2025. Additionally, there was an increase in capitalized interest of $2.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, due to an increase in development activity as compared to the same period in 2024.\nInterest and other income\ndecreased by $61.3 million or 78.3% to $17.0 million in income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $78.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease of $43.1 million in gains from legal settlements. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company settled two lawsuits related to construction defects at two communities and received cash recoveries of $42.5 million. The Company determined that all uncertainties were resolved upon receipt of cash and recorded a gain. There were no material gains from legal settlements during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nEquity income from co-investments\nincreased by $6.3 million or 18.7% to $40.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $33.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a $5.2 million gain recognized on sale of co-investment community in the third quarter of 2025. The increase was also attributable to a $3.7 million impairment loss on one of the Company’s preferred equity investments incurred during the first quarter of 2024 with no current year equivalent. These increases were offset by decreases of $6.5 million in income from preferred equity investments due to fewer outstanding investments at Septemb"
