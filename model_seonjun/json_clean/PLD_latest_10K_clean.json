  "item1_clean": "From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties, including by contributing properties to our co-investment ventures. Under the IRC, any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. We do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the IRS would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer, disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT.\n\nOur development business provides the opportunity to build modern logistics facilities that address the evolving requirements of our customers while deepening our presence in our target markets. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to: (i) the strategic locations of our global land bank and redevelopment sites for the development of future industrial properties or data centers; (ii) the development expertise of our local teams; (iii) the depth of our customer relationships; (iv) our ability to integrate sustainable design features that provide operational efficiencies for our customers; and (v) our procurement capabilities that allow us to secure high-demand construction materials at a lower cost. Successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects are leased, generate income and increase the value of our Real Estate Segment. Generally, we develop properties in the U.S. to hold for the long term or to contribute to our unconsolidated co-investment venture, and outside the U.S. to contribute to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.\n\nRental operations comprise the largest component of our reportable segments and generally contributes 90% to 95% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO. We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. For leases that commenced during 2024 within the consolidated operating portfolio, the weighted average lease term was 64 months. We expect to generate earnings growth by increasing rents, maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses. The primary driver of our revenue growth will be the rolling of in-place leases to current market rents when leases expire, as discussed further below. We believe our active portfolio management, combined with the skills of our property, leasing, maintenance, energy, sustainability and risk management teams allow us to maximize NOI across our portfolio. Substantially all of our consolidated rental revenue, NOI and cash flows from rental operations are generated in the U.S.\n\nWe carry insurance coverage for our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self-insurance and a wholly owned captive insurance entity. The business of our wholly owned captive insurance entity is ancillary to the owning and operating of our real estate. The costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through expense reimbursements from our customers. Additionally, in 2024 we sponsored a catastrophe bond issuance that provides further insurance coverage through 2027 for potential losses resulting from earthquake risks in the U.S. We believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nWe have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties through the direct acquisition of real estate, the acquisition of entities that own real estate or through additional investments in co-investment ventures that acquire properties. The acquisition of properties involves risks, including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation, repositioning, renovation and improvements identified in the pre-acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates. When we acquire properties, we may face risks associated with entering a new market such as a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. Additionally, there is, and it is expected there will continue to be, significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities. The acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities, including tax liabilities, which may be without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based on our new ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it.\n\nWe and our unconsolidated co-investment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, namely windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance, as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located. The insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties, business activities and markets. We believe our properties and the properties of our co-investment ventures are adequately insured. Certain losses, however, including losses from floods, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots and pandemics, generally are not insured against or not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property.\n\nWe hold significant real estate investments in international markets where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency. At December 31, 2024, approximately $11.5 billion or 12.1% of our total consolidated assets were invested in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, principally the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen. For the year ended December 31, 2024, $382.7 million or 6.3% of our total consolidated segment NOI was denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on these amounts. As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. While we endeavor to manage this risk through our hedging and financing activities, a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and, specifically, our U.S. dollar reported financial position and results of operations.\n\nOur scale and customer-focused strategy have compelled us to expand the services we provide. Our 1.3 billion square foot portfolio has provided the foundation upon which we have built a platform of solutions to address challenges that our customers face in global fulfillment today. Through Prologis Essentials, we provide solutions to meet our customers’ operations and energy and sustainability needs. Our customer experience teams, proprietary technology and strategic partnerships are foundational to all aspects of our Prologis Essentials offerings. These resources allow us to provide our customers with unique and actionable insights and tools to help them make progress on sustainability goals and drive greater efficiency in their operations. Moreover, the principles of Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) are ingrained in our business strategy through our integrated approach to global impact and sustainability, which we believe creates value for our customers, investors, employees, and communities.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, 30.6% of our consolidated operating properties or $24.0 billion (based on consolidated gross book value, or investment before depreciation) were located in California (Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California markets), which represented 23.4% of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 31.8% of our consolidated operating property NOI. Our revenues from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for logistics properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact California’s economic climate. Because of the investment we have located in California, a downturn in California’s economy or real estate conditions, including state income tax and property tax laws, could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction management, development and disposition services. The majority of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the U.S. In certain ventures, we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees (“promotes” or “promote revenues”) periodically during the life of a venture, upon liquidation of a venture or upon stabilization of individual venture assets based primarily on the total return of the investments over certain financial hurdles\nPromote revenues are recognized when earned at the end of the promote period for the specific co-investment ventures. We plan to grow this business and increase revenues by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures.\n\nFurthermore, we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other finan",
  "item7_clean": "We exclude properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. We also exclude net termination and renegotiation fees and write-offs of fair value lease assets or liabilities to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property’s rental revenues without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property’s recurring operating performance. Net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. Same Store Property NOI is adjusted to include an allocation of property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). On consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management and leasing services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expense.\n\nThis reportable segment includes revenues from asset management and property management services, transactional services for acquisition, disposition and leasing activity and promote revenue earned from the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Revenues associated with the Strategic Capital Segment fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions, the fair value of the properties, timing of promotes, foreign currency exchange rates and other transactional activity. These revenues are reduced by the direct costs associated with the asset and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the Strategic Capital Segment through\nStrategic Capital Expenses\nand to the Real Estate Segment through\nboth in the Consolidated Financial Statements,\n\nReal Estate Segment.\nWe receive the majority of our operating cash through the net revenues of our Real Estate Segment, including the recovery of our operating costs. Cash flows generated by the Real Estate Segment are impacted by our acquisition, development and disposition activities, which are drivers of NOI recognized during each period. See the Results of Operations section above for further explanation of our Real Estate Segment. The revenues from this segment include noncash adjustments for straight-lined rents and amortization of above and below market leases of $645 million and $613 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nWe also generate operating cash through our Strategic Capital Segment by providing asset management and property management and other services to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. See the Results of Operations section above for the key drivers of the net revenues from our Strategic Capital Segment. Included in\nStrategic Capital Revenues\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income are the promotes we earn from the third-party investors in our co-investment ventures, which are recognized in operating activities in the period the cash is received, generally the quarter after the revenue is recognized.\n\nA critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires management judgment about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and material to an entity’s financial condition and results of operations. Management’s judgment considers historical and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Of the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, those presented below have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies as they relate to our financial condition at December 31, 2024, and 2023 and our operating results for the three-year period ended December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies.\n\nG&A expenses were $419 million and $390 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. G&A expenses increased in 2024 as compared to 2023, principally due to inflationary increases and higher compensation expenses. We capitalize certain internal costs that are incremental and directly related to our development and building improvement activities.\n\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023 is presented below. Information on 2022 is included in graphs only to show year over year trends in our results of operations and operating metrics. Our financial condition for 2022, results of operations for 2022, and 2023 compared to 2022 and details on the acquisition of Duke Realty Corporation and Duke Realty Limited Partnership (collectively \"Duke\" or the \"Duke Transaction\") is referenced throughout this document and can be found under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is incorporated by reference herein to our Annual Report on\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 13, 2024, and is available on the SEC’s website at\nand our Investor Relations website at\n\nThis reportable segment principally includes rental revenue and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties. This segment also includes the operating results of our renewable energy assets. We allocate the costs of our property management and\n\nOur FFO measures begin with NAREIT’s definition, and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. While not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating\nFFO, as modified by Prologis\n, both as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. Although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. These items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.\n\nWe evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two reportable segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. NOI by segment is a non-GAAP performance measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements. We consider NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our operating results.\n\nEstimated weighted average margin is calculated on development properties as estimated value creation, less estimated closing costs and taxes, if any, on properties expected to be sold or contributed, divided by TEI. Development margins fluctuate depending on several factors including cost of capital, changes in capitalization rates that are used to estimate value at completion and location and type of development, such as build-to-suit development.\n\nThe change is primarily due to higher insurance costs from a greater number of weather-related events in 2023. Development management and other also includes the operating results of our renewable energy assets.\n\nThe earnings we recognize can be impacted by: (i) the size, rental rates and occupancy of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture; (ii) interest expense based on the size and terms of the debt; (iii) gains or losses from the dispositions of properties, impairments and extinguishment of debt; (iv) our ownership interest in each venture; (v) other variances in revenues and expenses of each venture; and (vi) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to U.S. dollars. See the discussion of our unconsolidated entities above in the Strategic Capital Segment discussion and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.\n\nThe U.S. expenses include compensation and personnel costs for employees who are based in the U.S. but also support other geographies.\n\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, including the effect of foreign currency\nexchange rates on cash\n\nITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nOur operating results were strong in 2024, despite the softening of rents and occupancy in our global logistics markets. Due to increases in market rents over the last several years, our existing lease mark-to-market continued to drive rent change on rollover and same-store growth in our O&M portfolio. This lease mark-to-market has remained meaningfully positive despite recent quarters of lower or even negative market rental growth due to the compounded nature of market rent growth. Our operating portfolio occupancy was 95.8% at December 31, 2024 and rent change on leases that commenced during the year was 68.7%, on a net effective basis, both metrics based on our ownership share.\n\nThe fair value of real estate properties subject to purchase price allocation is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology, which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated net operating income of a property. Key assumptions may include market rents and capitalization rates. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends and market and economic conditions. We determine capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data and adjust if necessary, based on the property characteristics. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. For acquisitions of a significant portfolio of properties, the use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and allocate the most significant portion of the property value between the building and land could affect the depreciation expense we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life.\n\nWe assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. This assessment is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the expected hold period due to a change in our intent to sell a property in the near term. We have processes to monitor our intent with regard to our investments and the estimated disposition value in comparison to the current carrying value. If our assessment of potential triggering events indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to sell in the near term is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. We determine the fair value of the property based on the estimated proceeds from disposition that are based on quoted market values, third-party appraisals or discounted cash flow models that utilize the future net operating income of the property and expected market capitalization rates. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. Changes in economic and operating conditions could impact our intent and the assumptions used in determining the fair value that could result in future impairment.\n\n, including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.\n\nThese FFO measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.\n\nWe manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an O&M basis, which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We believe reviewing the results in this way allows management to understand performance more broadly as we manage the properties without regard to their ownership. We do not control the unconsolidated co-investment ventures for purposes of GAAP and the presentation of the ventures’ operating information does not represent a legal claim.\n\nIn the near term, our proprietary metrics indicate renewed activity in customer leasing decisions as we entered 2025, despite the current economic and geopolitical environment. Additionally, we expect our development activity to increase as market conditions warrant. Overall, we believe we are well-positioned to organically grow revenues over the long-term, as our in-place leases have considerable upside potential to capture the cumulative growth in market rents over the last several years.\n\nWe evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis. The following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues, rental expenses and property NOI for each quarter in 2024 and 2023 to the full year, as included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and within Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended December 31 (dollars in millions):\n\nG&A expenses and equity-based compensation awards.\nWe incurred $419 million and $390 million of G&A expenses in 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recognized equity-based, noncash compensation expenses of $232 million and $268 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were recorded to\nin the Real Estate Segment,\nStrategic Capital Expenses\nin the Strategic Capital Segment and\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nWe capitalize costs incurred in improving and leasing our operating properties as part of the investment basis or within\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following graph summarizes recurring capitalized expenditures and leasing costs of our consolidated operating properties during each year and excludes development costs and spend subsequent to stabilization that is structural in nature and non-recurring:\n\nFor promotes earned after January 2024, we amended the Prologis Promote Plan (\"PPP\") to award up to 25% of the third-party portion of the promotes earned by us from the co-investment ventures to our employees. This award is issued as a c",
