Through our integrated business operations, we sell electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related products and sustainable solutions to various types of customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, public sector, and residential customers in markets across multiple geographic regions. We serve approximately 1.5 million total customers, including three-fourths of Fortune 100 companies, and approximately 1.2 million residential customers.\nWe are a leader in electric power supply, serving approximately 202 TWhs in 2024 through sales to retail customers and wholesale load auctions to a geographically diverse customer base. The following table illustrates these volumes across our five reportable segments:\n2024 Electric Power Supply (TWhs) Served\nIncludes retail load and wholesale load auction volumes only. Electric generation in excess of our total retail and wholesale load would be sold in the respective RTO or ISO in which our facility is located. Other includes New England, South, and West.\nWe are active in all domestic wholesale power and gas markets that span the entire lower 48 states and have complementary retail activity across many of those states. We typically obtain power supply from the market to meet our wholesale and retail obligations; our market risk is mitigated by our owned and contracted generation located in multiple geographic regions. The commodity risks associated with the output from owned and contracted generation are managed using various commodity transactions including sales to retail customers, trades on commodity exchanges, bilateral contracts, and sales to wholesale counterparties in accordance with our hedging program. See further discussion of the hedging program in the Price and Supply Risk Management section below. The main objective is to obtain low-cost energy supply to meet physical delivery obligations to both our wholesale and retail customers.\nRetail competition in states across the U.S. range from full competition of energy suppliers for all retail customers (commercial, industrial, public sector, and residential) to partial retail competition available up to a capped amount for C&I customers only. We are a leader in retail markets, serving approximately 144 TWhs of electric power retail load and approximately 800 Bcf of gas in 2024, primarily to C&I customers across multiple geographic regions in the U.S.\nDiverse Geographic Footprint in Retail Market\nStrong customer relationships are a key part of our customer-facing business strategy, as demonstrated by our high renewal rates. Retail customer renewal rates have been strong over the last nine years across C&I power customer groups with average contract terms of approximately two years and customer duration of approximately five years, with many customers well beyond these metrics. Specifically, we enjoyed renewal rates of 78% for C&I power customers and 88% for C&I gas customers in 2024, owing to both our competitive pricing as well as our strong customer relationships. Our consistently high renewal rates are driven by our ability to provide customized solutions and deliver focused attention to our customers’ needs, resulting in an industry-leading C&I customer-service business ranking in the DNV 2024 Energy Blueprint: Sales Strategies report. We are also successful at acquiring new customers by offering innovative services and products that meet their needs. In addition to our high customer renewal rates, we have produced consistently high new win rates within C&I power\nas well, acquiring nearly one out of every three new customers who have chosen to shop with us over the past six years.\nHigh customer satisfaction levels, market expertise, stability, and scale driven growth have resulted in a historically proven business with consistent margins. While providing customers with a competitive price is a key focus, we leverage our broad suite of electric and gas product structures, oftentimes customized, to provide customers with the commodity solution and information that best fits their needs. It is this attention to the customer that creates the durable and repeatable value highlighted in these statistics.\nConsumer purchasing strategies have trended from direct supply relationships to third-party relationships with a number of customers looking to third-party consultants and brokers to find suppliers like us to reduce costs and evaluate the increasing number of options available for expanding energy solutions beyond the commodity. In response, we have expanded our third-party capabilities, created scale through a comprehensive support structure, and enhanced digital applications providing tools, tracking, and measurement, as well as the ability to extend the reach of our sustainability solutions to drive additional market share. While this trend of customers using third parties to find suppliers has slowed in recent years, we have remained the market leader in direct C&I sales with over 32% of the C&I market share of direct customer business driven by our highly experienced and long-tenor direct sales team.\nOur wholesale channel-to-market involves the sale of electricity among electric utilities and electricity marketers before it is eventually sold to end-use consumers. In 2024, we served approximately 58 TWhs of power load across competitive utility load procurement and bilateral sales to municipalities, co-ops, and other wholesale entities. Complementary to our national customer portfolio, we have several decades of relationships with wholesale counterparties across all domestic power markets as a means of both monetizing our own generation, as well as sourcing contracted generation to meet customer and portfolio needs. With increased customer demand for sustainability, our ability to source contracted generation has provided a capital-light way for us to provide customers with long-term sustainable solutions they are demanding to support a cleaner energy ecosystem. This creates durable customer relationships and repeatable business through the ability to respond to customer and marketplace trends. Similarly, this contracting acumen provides the ability to supplement our native generation with other non-renewable assets to meet changing portfolio needs in a financially efficient manner.\nIn our wholesale gas business, we participate across all parts of the gas value chain, including trading, transport and storage, and physical supply.\nAs one of the largest customer-facing platforms in the U.S., we benefit from significant economies of scale, that allow us to provide our customers with competitively priced energy and to structure highly tailored solutions targeted to a customer’s unique power needs and clean energy goals. Our CORe+ product serves C&I customers' sustainability needs by matching contracted, third-party new-build renewable generation with customer desire to add additional carbon-free generation to the grid with a preference to be located within the same region as their load. In 2024, we continued to see growing demand for our Hourly Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) product and platform, as we have closed a number of additional Hourly CFE transactions with a strong pipeline of interested prospects. Achieving 100% carbon-free power is a key sustainability goal for many organizations. As customers make the transition to 100% hourly carbon-free power, many are looking to bridge the gap between their real-time electricity demand and available sources of carbon-free power. Our Hourly CFE platform and associated products match carbon-free generation every hour with a customer’s load, along with appropriate tracking and retirement of hourly attributes in the applicable registry. Many existing CORe+ customers are converting to 100% Hourly CFE with existing nuclear filling in the gaps of the hours renewable generation is not producing. In addition to larger-scale CORe+ offerings and Hourly CFE, we offer a range of sustainability solutions to customers (e.g., RECs, CORe+, EFECs, RINs, RNG, carbon offsets, etc.) as well as offers for carbon-free generation attributes to support their needs during the transition to a carbon-free energy ecosystem.\nWe also partner with our customers to provide energy efficiency options to meet their carbon-free energy goals. Our energy efficiency products provide the ability to optimize performance and maximize efficiency across customer facilities and operations through contract structures that include implementation of energy efficiency upgrades and behind-the-meter solutions with no upfront capital requirements. Additionally, these service\nofferings provide scalable solutions to meet sustainability goals through investment across the life of the facility or operations and allow for greater budget certainty. The ongoing ability to optimize energy consumption for customers allows us to support customer demands with the right combination of technology and efficiency program options.\nIn addition to sustainability solutions, data and analytics have also become increasingly important for our customers. We recently launched Constellation Navigator, which delivers customized paths and sustainable solutions for customers to set and meet their environmental and operational goals. Driven by advanced technology platforms and experienced advisors, it provides strategies to help organizations understand their baseline emissions and reduce their carbon footprints. Constellation Navigator helps businesses solve challenges across the energy lifecycle including utility bill management, carbon accounting, rebate administration and sustainability advisory services. These platforms and services provide new avenues for incremental growth by coupling the opportunities for customer usage optimization with accompanying products and sustainable solutions that we can provide to customers. These types of data and analytical services allow us to grow our customer base in previously inaccessible regulated markets by offering non-commodity energy-related products and services.\nWe continue to look for new and innovative products and solutions to bring to our customers. Constellation Technology Ventures (CTV) is our venture investing business, focused on driving innovation and scaling breakthrough technologies. CTV invests in a broad range of hardware and software solutions that accelerate the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy. Our portfolio spans diverse areas, including, generation technologies, sustainability monitoring tools, distributed energy resources, financing solutions, and more. By collaborating closely with our portfolio companies, we help commercialize their products and technologies across our expansive customer base, creating value for both our partners and us.\nPrice and Supply Risk Management\nWe leverage a combination of wholesale and retail customer load sales, federal and state programs, as well as non-derivative and derivative contracts, all with credit-approved counterparties, to hedge the commodity price risk of our generation portfolio.\nBeginning in 2024, our existing nuclear fleet is eligible for the nuclear PTC provided by the IRA, an important tool in managing commodity price risk for each nuclear unit not already receiving state support. The nuclear PTC provides increasing levels of support as unit revenues decline below levels established in the IRA and is further adjusted for inflation after 2024 through the duration of the program based on the GDP price deflator for the preceding calendar year. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters and Note 6 — Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the nuclear PTC.\nIn locations and periods where our load serving activities do not naturally offset existing generation portfolio r",
  "item7_clean": "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nWe are a producer of carbon-free energy and a supplier of energy products and services. Our generating capacity includes primarily nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric assets. Through our integrated business operations, we sell electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related products and sustainable solutions to various types of customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial,\nSignificant Transactions and Developments\nProposed Acquisition of Calpine Corporation\nOn January 10, 2025, we entered an agreement and plan of merger (Merger Agreement) with Calpine Corporation (Calpine) under which we will acquire all the outstanding equity interests of Calpine in a cash and stock transaction. Calpine owns and operates a generation fleet of natural gas, geothermal, battery storage, and solar assets with over 27 GWs of generation capacity, in addition to a competitive retail electric supplier platform serving approximately 2.5 million customers with 60 TWhs of load annually.\nThis acquisition is complementary to and aligns strategically with our existing business operations and provides both increased scale and meaningful market diversification. We will couple the largest producer of clean, carbon-free energy with the reliable, dispatchable natural gas assets of Calpine, and also create the nation’s leading competitive retail electric supplier, providing increased scale, diversification and complementary capabilities that will enable us to meet growing demand with a broader array of energy and sustainability products. The addition of Calpine will strengthen our essential role in providing clean, reliable, and affordable energy as the nation seeks to transition to a more sustainable future, and will better position us to pursue investments in new and existing technologies to meet growing demand.\nCompletion of the transaction is conditioned upon review of the transaction by the DOJ, and approval by the FERC, NYPSC, and PUCT, in addition to other regulatory bodies, and is also subject to other customary closing conditions. See Note 2 — Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCrane Clean Energy Center\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we executed a 20-year PPA with Microsoft that will support the restart of Three Mile Island Unit 1, renamed as the Crane Clean Energy Center, which was retired in 2019 for economic reasons. Under the agreement, Microsoft will purchase the output generated from the renewed plant as part of its goal to help power its data centers in PJM with clean energy. We expect Crane will also be eligible for the technology-neutral clean electricity PTC (45Y) provided for by the IRA for its first 10 years of operations. We estimate the project will require approximately $1.6 billion of cash from operations for capital expenditures necessary to restart the plant, with an estimated in-service date of 2028. The restart of the plant and delivery of electricity under the PPA is subject to certain regulatory approvals, including the NRC comprehensive safety and environmental review, as well as permits from relevant state and local agencies. Additionally, through a separate request, we will pursue obtaining a renewed license that will extend operations at the plant to at least 2054.\nBeginning in 2024, our existing nuclear units are eligible for a PTC extending through 2032. The nuclear PTC (45U) provides a transferable credit up to $15 per MWh (a base credit of $3 per MWh with a five times multiplier provided certain prevailing wage requirements are met) and is subject to phase-out when annual gross receipts are between $25.00 per MWh and $43.75 per MWh. We have evaluated and expect to meet the annual prevailing wage requirements at all our nuclear units and are eligible for the five times multiplier. Both the amount of the PTC and the gross receipts thresholds adjust for inflation after 2024 through the duration of the program based on the GDP price deflator for the preceding calendar year. The benefits of the PTC may be realized through a credit against our federal income taxes or transferred via sale to an unrelated party. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income include a nuclear PTC benefit of approximately $2,080 million in Operating revenues. See Note 6 — Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nShare Repurchase Program\nAs part of our capital allocation plan, our Board of Directors has authorized up to $3 billion of share repurchases of our outstanding common stock to-date, of which $991 million has yet to be exercised. See Note 19 — Shareholders' Equity of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Key Business Drivers\nRussia and Ukraine Conflict\nWe are closely monitoring developments of the ongoing Russia and Ukraine conflict, including United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Canadian sanctions, and legislation that may impact exports and imports of Russian nuclear fuel supply and enrichment activities, as well as the potential for Russia to limit fuel deliveries. The U.S. “Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act” became effective in August 2024, banning the import of low-enriched uranium into the U.S. that is produced in Russia or by Russian entities, absent a waiver from the DOE. Under a corollary bill, the Department of Energy has begun the process of distributing billions of dollars that were previously appropriated to support expansion of the domestic nuclear fuel cycle within the United States to improve carbon-free energy security. In November 2024, the Russian government issued a decree imposing temporary restrictions on the export of enriched uranium from Russia to the U.S. but allowing for a special Russian export license to be issued for individual shipments. Our nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium supply and service contracts. We work with a diverse set of domestic and international suppliers years in advance to procure our nuclear fuel to support our refueling needs regardless of the risk to Russian nuclear fuel supply. Recognizing the potential for the continuing conflict to impact our longer-term security and cost of supply, we have entered into contracts to increase the size of our nuclear fuel inventory. Our fuel procurement activities comply with all U.S. and international trade laws and we continue to take advantage of all available avenues to maintain continuity in our nuclear fuel supply, including working with the U.S. Government and our diverse set of suppliers to secure the nuclear fuel needed to continue to operate our nuclear fleet long-term.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the accounting policies described below require significant judgment in their application or incorporate estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional information on the application of these accounting policies can be found in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations\nThe AROs associated with decommissioning our nuclear un\nDecember 31, 2024. The authoritative guidance requires that we estimate our obligation for the future decommissioning of our nuclear generating plants. To estimate that liability, we use an internally-developed, probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple decommissioning outcome scenarios.\nOver the past decade, nuclear operators and third-party service providers have continued to obtain more information about costs associated with decommissioning activities. At the same time, regulators are gaining more information about decommissioning activities which could result in changes to existing decommissioning requirements. In addition, over time, it is possible that technological advances will be identified that could create efficiencies and lead to a reduction in decommissioning costs. The amount of NDT funds could also impact the timing of the decommissioning activities. Additionally, certain factors such as changes in regulatory requirements during plant operations or the profitability of a nuclear plant could impact the timing of plant retirements. These factors could result in material changes to our current estimates as more information becomes available and could change the timing of plant retirements and the probability assigned to the decommissioning outcome scenarios.\nThe nuclear decommissioning obligation is adjusted on a regular basis due to the passage of time and revisions to the key assumptions for the expected timing and/or estimated amounts of the future undiscounted cash flows\nrequired to decommission the nuclear plants, based upon the following methodologies and significant estimates and assumptions:\nDecommissioning Cost Studies.\nWe use unit-by-unit decommissioning cost studies to provide a marketplace assessment of the expected costs (in current year dollars) and timing of decommissioning activities, which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning projects within the industry and other estimates. Decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of our nuclear units at least every five years, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates. As part of the annual cost study update process, we evaluate newly assumed costs or substantive changes in previously assumed costs to determine if the cost estimate impacts are sufficiently material to warrant application of the updated estimates to the AROs across the nuclear fleet outside of the normal five-year rotating cost study update cycle.\nCost Escalation Factors.\nWe use cost escalation factors to escalate the decommissioning costs from the decommissioning cost studies discussed above through the assumed decommissioning period for each of the units. Cost escalation studies, updated on an annual basis, are used to determine escalation factors, and are based on inflation indices for labor, equipment and materials, energy, LLRW disposal, and other costs. All the nuclear AROs are adjusted each year for updated cost escalation factors.\nProbabilistic Cash Flow Models.\nOur probabilistic cash flow models include the assignment of probabilities to various scenarios for decommissioning cost levels, decommissioning approaches, and timing of plant shutdown on a unit-by-unit basis. Probabilities assigned to cost levels include an assessment of the likelihood of costs 20% higher (high-cost scenario) or 15% lower (low-cost scenario) than the base-cost scenario. The assumed decommissioning scenarios generally include the following three alternatives: (1) DECON, which assumes major decommissioning activities begin shortly after the cessation of operation, (2) Shortened SAFSTOR, which generally assumes a 30-year delay prior to onset of major decommissioning activities, and (3) SAFSTOR, which assumes the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in such condition during decommissioning, so that the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated within 60 years after cessation of operations. In each decommissioning scenario, spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage as soon as possible until DOE acceptance for disposal.\nThe actual decommissioning approach selected will be determined at the time of shutdown and may be influenced by multiple factors including the funding status of the NDT funds at the time of shutdown and regulatory or other commitments.\nThe plant shutdown timing scenarios consider four alternatives: (1) the probability of early plant retirement, (2) the probability of operating through the original 40-year nuclear license term, (3) the probability of operating through an initial 20-year license renewal term, and (4) the probability of a second 20-year license renewal term. As power market and regulatory environment developments occur, we evaluate and incorporate, as necessary, the impacts of such developments into our nuclear ARO assumptions and estimates.\nOur probabilistic cash flow models also include an assessment of the timing of DOE acceptance of SNF for disposal. We currently assume DOE will begin accepting SNF from the industry in 2040. The SNF acceptance date assumption is based on management’s estimates of the amount of time required for DOE to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure for long-term SNF storage. For additional information regarding SNF, see Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe probability-weighted estimated future cash flows for the various assumed scenarios are discounted using our specific credit-adjusted, risk-free rates (CARFR) or a AAA-rated U.S. company proxy CARFR for the units that maintain the ability to collect decommissioning costs from utility customers (former PECO and STP units). We initially recognize an ARO at fair value and subsequently adjust it for changes to estimated costs, timing of future cash flows and modifications to decommissioning assumptions. The ARO is not required or permitted to be re-measured for changes in the CARFR that occur in isolation. Increases in the ARO due to upward revisions in estimated undiscounted cash flows are considered new obligations and are measured using a current CARFR as the increase creates a new cost layer within the ARO. Any decrease in the estimated undiscounted future cash flows relating to the ARO are treated as a modification of an existing ARO cost layer and, therefore, are measured using the average historical CARFR rates used in creating the initial ARO cost layers. If all our future nominal cash flows associated with the ARO were to be discounted at the current prevailing CARFR, the obligation would decrease from approximately $12.2 billion to approximately $11.2 billion.\nThe following table illustrates the significant impact that changes in the CARFR, when combined with changes in projected amounts and expected timing of cash flows, can have on the valuation of the ARO:\nChange in the CARFR applied to the annual ARO update\nIncrease (Decrease) to ARO as of December 31, 2024\n2023 CARFR rather than the 2024 CARFR\n2024 CARFR increased by 50 basis points\n2024 CARFR decreased by 50 basis points\nChanges in the assumptions underlying the ARO could materially affect the decommissioning obligation. The impact of a change in any one of these assumptions to the ARO is highly dependent on how the other assumptions may correspondingly change.\nThe following table illustrates the effects of changing certain ARO assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant:\nChange in ARO Assumption\nIncrease (Decrease) to ARO as of December 31, 2024\nCost escalation studies\nUniform increase in escalation rates of 50 basis points\nProbabilistic cash flow models\nIncrease the estimated costs to decommission the nuclear plants by 10 percent\nIncrease the likelihood of the DECON scenario by 10 percent and decrease the likelihood of the SAFSTOR scenario by 10 percent\nShorten each unit's probability-weighted operating life assumption by 10 percent\nExtend the estimated date for DOE acceptance of SNF to 2045\nExcludes any sites in which management has committed to a specific decommissioning approach.\nExcludes Crane and Zion.\nSee N",
