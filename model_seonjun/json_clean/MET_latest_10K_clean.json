We operate in nine jurisdictions throughout Asia, with our largest operation in Japan. We market our products and services through a range of proprietary and third-party distribution channels.\nIn Japan, our face-to-face channels, including both career and general agency, continue to be critical to our overall distribution strategy, catering to various needs of individual retail customers. Outside of Japan, our distribution strategies vary by market and leverage a combination of career and general agencies and bancassurance. In select markets, we also use independent brokers for retail sales and our employee sales force to sell group products.\nWhole and term life, endowments, universal and variable life, as well as group life products.\nAccident & Health Insurance\nFull range of accident & health products, including hospitalization, cancer, critical illness, disability, income protection and personal accident coverage.\nRetirement and Savings\nFixed and variable annuities, as well as regular savings products.\nOur largest operations are in Mexico and Chile. We market our products and services through a multi-channel distribution strategy which varies by geographic region and stage of market development.\nWe have an exclusive and captive agency distribution network which sells a variety of individual life, accident & health, and pension products. Our direct marketing channel includes sponsors and telesales representatives selling mainly accident & health and individual life products directly to consumers. We also work with brokers and independent agents on sales of group and individual life, accident & health, group medical, dental and pension products, and worksite marketing. We also offer to government employees life and medical insurance, as well as retirement and savings, and other products.\nWhole and term life, endowments, universal and variable life, as well as group life products.\nRetirement and Savings\nFixed annuities and pension products. Fixed income annuities provide for asset distribution needs. Our savings-oriented pension products are primarily offered in Chile under a mandatory privatized social security system.\nAccident & Health Insurance\nGroup and individual major medical, accidental, and supplemental health products, including AD&D, hospital indemnity, medical reimbursement, and medical coverage for serious medical conditions, as well as dental products.\nPolicies designed to fulfill certain loan obligations in the event of the policyholder’s death.\nEMEA\nWe operate across EMEA in both developed (Western Europe) and emerging (Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa) markets. Our largest operations are in the Gulf region, the U.K. and France. In more mature markets, we focus our strategy on our preferred market segments to play a “niche” role. We also have a strong market presence in emerging markets leveraging a multi-channel distribution strategy.\nOur businesses in EMEA use captive and independent agency, independent brokerage, bancassurance, corporate solutions and direct-to-consumer distribution channels.\nTraditional and non-traditional life insurance products, such as whole and term life, endowments and variable life products, as well as group term life programs in most markets.\nRetirement and Savings\nFixed annuities and pension products, including group pension programs in select markets.\nAccident & Health Insurance\nIndividual and group personal accident and supplemental health products, including AD&D, hospital indemnity, scheduled medical reimbursement plans, and coverage for serious medical conditions. In addition, we provide individual and group major medical coverage in select markets.\nPolicies designed to fulfill certain loan obligations in the event of the policyholder’s death.\nThis segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses that we no longer actively market in the U.S. These include variable, universal, term and whole life insurance, variable, fixed and index-linked annuities, and long-term care insurance. It also includes an in-force block of assumed variable annuity guarantees from a third party. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on a reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023.\nVariable, Universal and Term Life Insurance\nSimilar to products offered by our Group Benefits segment, except that these products were historically marketed to individuals through various retail distribution channels. For a description of these products, see “— Group Benefits.”\nWhole Life Insurance\nA benefit upon the death of the insured in return for the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a predetermined period. Whole life insurance includes policies that provide a participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders may receive dividends in cash, or apply them to increase death benefits, increase cash values available upon surrender or reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force.\nVariable annuities provide for asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Variable annuities allow the contractholder to allocate deposits into various investment options in a separate account, as determined by the contractholder. In certain variable annuity products, contractholders may also choose to allocate all or a portion of their account to the Company’s general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Contractholders may also elect certain minimum death benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for which additional fees are charged and where asset allocation restrictions may apply.\nFixed and Indexed-Linked Annuities\nFixed annuities provide for asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Deposits made into deferred annuity contracts are allocated to the Company’s general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Fixed income annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified period of years and/or for the life of the annuitant. Additionally, the Company has issued indexed-linked annuities which allow the contractholder to participate in returns from equity indices.\nProtection against the potentially high costs of long-term health care services. Generally pays benefits to insureds who need assistance with activities of daily living or have a cognitive impairment.\nCorporate & Other contains various start-up, developing and run-off businesses. Also included in Corporate & Other are: the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments (including external integration and disposition costs, internal resource costs for associates committed to acquisitions and dispositions and enterprise-wide strategic initiatives), interest expense related to the majority of the Company’s outstanding debt, expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and income tax audit issues, the elimination of intersegment amounts (which generally relate to investment expenses and intersegment loans bearing interest rates commensurate with related borrowings), and the Company’s institutional investment management business (through which the Company provides public fixed income, private capital and real estate investment solutions to institutional investors worldwide).\nPolicyholder Liabilities\nWe establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to provide for future annuity payments. Our liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For life insurance and annuity products, we calculate these liabilities based on assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums to be received over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy and the amount of benefits or claims to be paid. We establish liabilities for claims and benefits based on assumptions and estimates of losses and liabilities incurred. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported on the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on policyholder liabilities see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Future Policy Benefit Liabilities.”\nMetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated reinsurers, establish statutory reserves under methods prescribed by the insurance laws of their respective domiciliary jurisdiction. These reserves are reported as liabilities, and we expect them to be sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed rates. Statutory reserves and actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits reported under GAAP generally differ due to the difference in accounting requirements.\nU.S. state insurance laws and regulations require certain MetLife entities to submit an annual opinion and memorandum of a qualified actuary. In it, the qualified actuary states that the statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, adequately provide for the anticipated cash flow required to meet contractual obligations and related expenses.\nInsurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate require certain MetLife entities to prepare and submit a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements. See “— Regulation — State Insurance Regulation — Reserves and Asset Adequacy Analysis.”\nUnderwriting and Pricing\nWe use a variety of underwriting and pricing management controls. Our Global Risk Management department develops product pricing standards and oversees underwriting practices in MetLife’s insurance businesses. We also regularly conduct experience studies to monitor assumptions against expectations, impose formal new product approval processes, periodically update product profitability studies, and use reinsurance to manage our exposures, as appropriate. See “— Reinsurance Activity.”\nOur underwriters and actuaries use detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures to assess and quantify insurance risks, and determine the type and the amount of risk we are willing to accept.\nInsurance underwriters consider an applicant’s medical history and other factors such as financial profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco use. Group insurance underwriters generally evaluate the risk characteristics of the prospective insured group, but may underwrite members of a group on an individual basis for certain voluntary products and coverages. Our own employees generally perform our underwriting, but intermediaries review certain policies under guidelines established by us. Generally, we are not obligated to accept any risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of policies to, any employer or intermediary. We review requests for coverage on their merits and issue policies only after we have examined and approved the particular risk or group under our underwriting guidelines.\nWe periodically review all our underwriting to maintain high standards of quality and consistency. Our reinsurers generally have the right to audit our underwriting.\nWe use underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies, and strateg",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIndex to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements and Other Financial Information\nConsolidated Company Outlook\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nResults of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAdopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFuture Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\nForward-Looking Statements and Other Financial Information\nFor purposes of this discussion, “MetLife,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. This discussion should be read in conjunction with “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and the Company’s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to our performance measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, that are not based on GAAP. See “— Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures” for definitions and a discussion of these and other financial measures, and “— Results of Operations” and “— Investments” for reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nConsolidated Company Outlook\nAt the December 2024 Investor Day, we introduced our New Frontier five-year strategy which is designed to accelerate growth across our global platform while delivering attractive returns and all-weather performance. Our New Frontier strategy builds upon the success of our five-year Next Horizon strategy, which we announced in 2019, with an aim to focus, simplify and differentiate the Company.\nOur outlook reflects continued uncertainty around inflation and unemployment in 2025. We expect the U.S. dollar to strengthen in 2025 compared to 2024.\nBased on the forward yield curve as of December 31, 2024, we expect long-term interest rates to remain stable in 2025 with the yield curve steepening, as short-term interest rates decline. We believe that our investment portfolio is highly diversified and positioned to perform well in a variety of economic scenarios. See “— Industry Trends — Impact of Market Interest Rates” for discussion of the mitigating actions the Company has taken to reduce interest rate sensitivity, as market interest rates are a key driver of our results.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $5.1 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding companies which is above the high end of our $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion holding company cash target. In 2025, we expect to maintain this holding company cash target. We have also returned a total of approximately $21.0 billion to shareholders from 2020 through 2024, and we expect to generate approximately $25.0 billion in free cash flow over the next five years.\nOur continued capital stress testing and longstanding commitment to liquidity position us to withstand a variety of economic conditions. We do not expect any material liquidity deficiencies, and we expect to remain able to comply with the financial covenants of our credit agreements. See “— Liquidity and Capital Resources.” We will continue reviewing accounting estimates, asset valuations and various financial scenarios for capital and liquidity implications. See “— Investments — Current Environment” and “Risk Factors” for additional information.\nAssuming (i) interest rates follow the observable forward yield curves as of December 31, 2024, including a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of 4.69% at December 31, 2025, (ii) S&P 500 equity index annual return of 5%, and (iii) private equity annual returns between 9% to 11% over the near-term, we expect to maintain the two-year average annual ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items, at 65% to 75%.\nFurther, based on the aforementioned assumptions, we (i) increased our target for adjusted return on equity\n, excluding total notable items, from 13%-15% to 15%-17%, and (ii) established a new target of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, excluding total notable items, over the near-term.\nBased on our continued focus on expense discipline and our overall efficiency mindset, we lowered our full year direct expense ratio target, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers, from 12.3% to (i) 12.1% over the near-term and (ii) 11.3% over the New Frontier period.\nOur outlook relies on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. We continually review our assumptions, implement mitigation plans, and take precautions. We may revise our outlook as we obtain more information regarding economic conditions, regulatory changes, and other events, and the impact of these events on our business operations, investment portfolio, derivatives, financial results and financial condition.\nBeginning with fourth quarter and full year 2024 results and going forward, “adjusted return on equity” refers to return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) other than foreign currency translation adjustments (“FCTA”) and certain ceded reinsurance-related embedded derivatives.\nWe continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry.\nFinancial and Economic Environment\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally due to our market presence in numerous countries, our large investment portfolio and the sensitivity of our insurance liabilities and derivatives to changing market factors.\nWe are closely monitoring political and economic conditions that might contribute to global market volatility and impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives, such as global inflation, supply chain disruptions, acts of war and banking sector volatility. We are also monitoring the imposition of tariffs, sanctions or other barriers to international trade, changes to international trade agreements, and their potential impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “— Impact of Market Interest Rates — Effects of Inflation,” and “— Investments — Current Environment.”\nGovernments and central banks around the world use fiscal and monetary policies to address uncertain economic conditions. In the U.S., the Federal Open Market Committee took various actions in 2024 to promote economic stability, including lowering interest rates during the second half of the year. Labor market conditions, inflation and financial and international developments, as well as other factors, could affect the continuation of such actions in 2025. The European Central Bank and Bank of England have also recently lowered interest rates, but forecasts for 2025 are uncertain due to risks to economic growth and global trade. The Bank of Japan raised interest rates in January 2025 taking the policy rate to its highest level since 2008.\nImpact of Market Interest Rates\nMarket interest rates are a key driver of our results. Increases and decreases in such rates, as well as extended periods of stagnation, may impact our business and investments in various ways.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes that while inflation has not had a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates, both rising interest rates and inflation will have a neutral to modestly favorable impact on our business. We expect that a lower interest rate environment, however, will have a modestly unfavorable impact on our business. See “— Impact of a Rising Interest Rate Environment,” “— Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment,” and “— Interest Rate Scenarios.”\nAn increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. In our group life and disability businesses, premiums increase as compensation levels of our customers’ employees increase. However, during inflationary periods with rising interest rates, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses, resulting in additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other costs, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.\nImpact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment\nSustained periods of low U.S. interest rates may cause us to:\nReduce the difference between interest credited to policyholders and interest earned on supporting assets (“gross margin”);\nReinvest investment proceeds in lower yielding assets and experience higher frequency prepayment or redemption of assets in our portfolio;\nIncrease our reserves related to policy liabilities and potentially impair intangible assets;\nReduce interest expense, change pension and other post-retirement benefit calculations, and change derivative cash flows and market values;\nChange our product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and\nExperience changing policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.\nFor additional discussion on gross margin and interest rate assumptions, as well as the potential impact of low interest rates, see “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2023 — Actuarial Assumption Review”; “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions — Interest Rate Risks”; “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Be Required to Impair VOBA, VODA or VOCRA”; “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Be Required to Recognize an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to Establish a Valuation Allowance Against Our Deferred Income Tax Assets”; and “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Face Volatility, Higher Risk Management Costs, and Increased Counterparty Risk Due to Guarantees Within Certain of Our Products.”\nImpact of a Rising Interest Rate Environment\nPeriods of rising U.S. interest rates may cause us to:\nReinvest investment proceeds in higher yielding assets and experience lower frequency prepayment or redemption of assets in our portfolio;\nDecrease the value of our reserves related to policy liabilities;\nIncrease interest expense, change pension and other post-retirement benefit calculations, and change derivative cash flows and market values; and\nChange our product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix.\nFor additional discussion on the potential impact of rising interest rates, see “Risk Factors — Investment Risks — We May Change Our Securities and Investments Valuation, or Take Allowances and Impairments on Our Investments, or Change Our Methodologies, Estimations, and Assumptions.”\nTo manage the impact of a changing U.S. interest rate environment, we maintain diversification across products, distribution channels, and geographies while proactively evaluating interest rate and product strategies. In addition, we apply disciplined asset/liability management (“ALM”) strategies, including the use of derivatives. Our ability to take such actions may be limited by competition, regulatory approval requirements, or minimum crediting rate guarantees and may not match the timing or magnitude of interest rate changes.\nIn addition to proactive management strategies, businesses within our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments help alleviate impacts to our consolidated results given their limited U.S. interest rate sensitivity.\nFor additional discussion on interest rate risk management and our ability to change interest crediting rates or dividend scales, see “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions — Interest Rate Risks;” “— Risk Management;” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Management of Market Risk Exposures,” as well as Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Rate Scenarios\nTo illustrate our sensitivity to U.S. interest rates, we compared the outcome of two hypothetical interest rate environments (the “Declining Interest Rate Scenario” and “Rising Interest Rate Scenario”) relative to our baseline economic assumptions (the “Base Scenario”) through 2027.\nThe Declining Interest Rate Scenario assumes U.S. interest rates for all maturities decline immediately on January 1, 2025 by 50 basis points compared to the Base Scenario through 2027. The Rising Interest Rate Scenario assumes U.S. interest rates rise immediately on January 1, 2025 by 50 basis points through 2027. Other than changing U.S. interest rates through 2027, all other economic assumptions are equivalent in the Base Scenario, Declining Interest Rate Scenario and Rising Interest Rate Scenario.\nThe following table compares the most relevant interest rate assumptions for the dates indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\nInterest Rate Scenario\nRising Interest Rate Scenario\nInterest Rate Scenario\nRising Interest Rate Scenario\nInterest Rate Scenario\nRising Interest Rate Scenario\nSOFR\n10-year U.S. Treasury\n30-year U.S. Treasury\nHypothetical Impact to Net Derivative Gains (Losses), Market Risk Benefit Remeasurement (Gains) Losses and Adjusted Earnings\nWe estimate a net favorable impact to net derivative gains (losses) for 2025 through 2027 for the hypothetical Declining Interest Rate Scenario. We hold significant positions in long-duration receive-fixed U.S. interest rate swaps, which are most sensitive to the 10-year and 30-year swap rates, to hedge reinvestment risk. We estimate a net unfavorable impact to net derivative gains (losses) for 2025 through 2027 for the hypothetical Rising Interest Rate Scenario.\nWe estimate a net unfavorable impact to market risk benefit remeasurement (gains) losses for 2025 through 2027 for the hypothetical Declining Interest Rate Scenario. Under the hypothetical Declining Interest Rate Scenario, we expect the market risk benefit (“MRB”) reserves to increase due to discounting the future cash flows at a lower rate. We estimate a net favorable impact to market risk benefit remeasurement (gains) losses for 2025 through 2027 for the hypothetical Rising Interest Rate Scenario. Under the hypothetical Rising Interest Rate Scenario, we expect the MRB reserves to decrease due to discounting the future cash flows at a higher rate.\nWe estimate a net unfavorable impact to consolidated adjusted earnings for 2025 through 2027 for the hypothetical Declining Interest Rate Scenario. The negative impact of reinvesting cash flows in lower yielding assets is partially offset by lowering interest crediting rates and dividend scales on products, and additional derivative income. We estimate a net favorable impact t",
