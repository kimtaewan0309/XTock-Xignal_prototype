Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn this quarterly report, “EPAM,” “EPAM Systems, Inc.,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to EPAM Systems, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n“EPAM” is a trademark of EPAM Systems, Inc. All other trademarks and service marks used herein are the property of their respective owners.\nWe have used our software engineering expertise to become a leading global provider of digital engineering, cloud and AI-enabled transformation services, as well as a leading business and experience consulting partner for global enterprises and ambitious startups.

As a result, we have created a delivery base whereby our applications, tools, methodologies and infrastructure allow us to seamlessly deliver services and solutions from our global delivery centers to our clients across the world. Our teams of consultants, designers, architects, engineers and trainers have the capabilities and skill sets to deliver business results.\nBusiness Update Regarding the War in Ukraine\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian forces attacked Ukraine and its people, and through the issuance date of these interim financial statements, there has been no resolution to this attack. EPAM’s highest priority is the safety and security of its employees and their families in Ukraine as well as in the broader region, and we have continued to support relocating our employees to lower risk locations, both within Ukraine and to other countries where we operate. The vast majority of our Ukraine employees are in safe locations and operating at levels of productivity consistent with those achieved prior to the attack. As of September 30, 2025, Ukraine continues to be a significant delivery location with a large number of delivery professionals. Furthermore, we have maintained our $100 million humanitarian aid commitment to our people in Ukraine in addition to our other donations and volunteer efforts, and as of September 30, 2025, we have $12.5 million remaining to be expensed under this humanitarian commitment.\nThe impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on our operations, personnel, and physical assets in Ukraine has had, and, along with any escalation of the war that includes Belarus’ territory or military, could continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations. Actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Belarus, and Belarus’ responses to those sanctions, including counter-sanctions and other actions, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations. Clients have and may continue to seek altered terms, conditions, and delivery locations for the performance of services, delay planned work or seek services from alternate providers, or suspend, terminate, fail to renew, or reduce existing contracts or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Some of our clients have implemented steps to block internet communications with Ukraine and Belarus to protect against potential cyberattacks or other information security threats, which has caused a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver our services to these clients from those locations. Such material adverse effects disrupt our delivery of services, cause us to shift all or portions of our work occurring in the region to other countries, restrict our ability to engage in certain projects in the region and serve certain clients in or from the region, and could negatively impact our personnel, operations, financial results and business outlook. Our Board of Directors and its committees continue their oversight of our strategic, geopolitical, and cybersecurity risks and the risks related to our geographic expansion. Our Board has received updates from management during both regular and special meetings, while also providing oversight of the risks associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other strategic areas of importance related to the war.\nWe continue to monitor and respond to the difficult conditions in Ukraine while maintaining a focus on our clients and long-term growth. We execute on our business continuity plans and adapt to developments as they occur to protect the safety of our people and address impacts on our delivery infrastructure, including reallocating work to other geographies within our global footprint. We engage with both our personnel and our clients when navigating delivery challenges while operating productively in a multitude of locations and providing consistent high-quality delivery to our clients. Our global delivery centers have sufficient resources, including infrastructure and capital, to support ongoing operations while continuing to focus on the safety and security of our employees and their families in Ukraine as well as in the broader region.\nThe implementation and execution of our business continuity plans, relocation costs, our humanitarian commitment to our people in Ukraine, and the cost of our phased exit from Russia resulted in materially increased expenses. Some of these expenses continued during this quarter and we expect some of these expenses will continue to occur in subsequent quarters for some time in the future.\nYear-to-Date 2025 Developments and Trends\nFor the first nine months of 2025, our revenues were $4.050 billion, an increase of 16.4% from $3.480 billion reported for the same period of 2024. Revenues have been positively impacted by improving demand for our services, acquisitions completed in 2024, and foreign exchange fluctuations. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to 9.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to 11.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, largely driven by lower government incentives related to conducting R&D activities in Poland and an increase in cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of revenues. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $4.75 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from $6.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, principally resulting from a decrease in income from operations as well as reduced excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of equity awards.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a recurring basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition and related allowances, impairments of long-lived assets including intangible assets, goodwill and right-of-use assets, income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In addition, our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated. This information should be read together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report. The operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.\n\nthe acquisitions completed in 2024, higher variable compensation expens"
