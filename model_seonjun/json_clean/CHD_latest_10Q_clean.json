Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of 2025 increased by 50 bps to 12.8% compared to 12.3% in the same period in 2024 due to 110 bps on higher expense as we invest in our brands to drive market share growth and support new products, offset by 60 bps of leverage on higher net sales. Marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were $496.6, an increase of $6.4 or 1.3% as compared to the same period in 2024. Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales for the first nine months of 2025 increased by 10 bps to 10.9% as compared to 10.8% in the same period in 2024 due to 20 bps on higher expense, as we invest in our brands to drive market share growth and support new products, offset by 10 bps of leverage on higher net sales.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, we announced that we are exiting the Flawless, Spinbrush, and Waterpik showerheads businesses.\nThe Touchland acquisition is included in our results since July 16, 2025, the date of acquisition.\nThe increase in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025, reflects the impact of the Touchland® Acquisition and growth from THERABREATH® mouth wash, HERO® acne treatment products, ARM & HAMMER® Cat Litter, and TROJAN® condoms, partially offset by declines from VITAFUSION® gummy dietary supplements, and WATERPIK® Oral Care. The decrease in net sales for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2025, includes declines from VITAFUSION® gummy dietary supplements, OXICLEAN® Stain Fighters and WATERPIK® Oral Care, partially offset by the impact of the Touchland® Acquisition and growth from THERABREATH® mouth wash and HERO® acne treatment products.\n\nGross Profit / Gross Margin\nOur gross profit was $714.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2025, a $31.3 increase as compared to the same period in 2024. Gross margin decreased 10 basis points (“bps”) in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The decline in gross margin was due primarily to the impact of higher manufacturing costs of 220 bps (including labor, commodities and tariffs, net of tariff mitigation actions), partially offset by the impact of productivity programs of 170 bps, benefits from the Touchland Acquisition of 20 bps, favorable price/mix/volume of 10 bps, and favorable foreign exchange of 10 bps.\n\nWe sell our consumer products through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar and other discount stores, pet and other specialty stores and websites and other e-commerce channels, all of which sell our products to consumers. We sell our specialty products to industrial customers, livestock producers and through distributors.\nWe operate in three principal segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International, and our Specialty Products Division (“SPD”).\nGlobal Economic Conditions and Trade Policies\nWe continue to experience increased commodity cost volatility and economic uncertainty primarily due to rapid changes in U.S. trade policies including shifting changes in tariff policy. We continue to evaluate these evolving developments and have begun to take action to mitigate their impact on our business, including taking strategic actions for certain business lines (see Strategic Business Decisions), shifting production and relocating manufacturing operations, finding alternative sources of supply, most notably ceasing the import of substantially all Waterpik flossers and other products from China into the U.S., potential price increases, adjusting inventories, lobbying and seeking exemptions with respect to tariffs. While the tariff situation remains fluid, we are focused on managing through these challenges. We are currently projecting twelve-month run-rate tariff costs of approximately $25.0 net of mitigation activities. Over the next 12 months, we believe our tariff cost exposure can be further reduced through additional supply chain efforts and surgical pricing.\nStrategic Business Decisions\nOn May 1, 2025, we announced that we will be exiting the Flawless, Spinbrush and Waterpik showerhead businesses, which we intend to complete by early 2026. These businesses generated approximately $170.0 of annual Net Sales in 2024. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $51.0 in the second quarter of 2025 as a direct result of these actions, of which $30.4 was recorded in Cost of sales and $20.6 was recorded in SG&A. The charge was primarily recorded in the Consumer Domestic segment and was comprised of non-cash charges related to impairments of intangible and fixed assets, as well as inventory reserves.\nOn August 1, 2025, we announced that we are performing a strategic review of our vitamin business. This review includes potential actions to streamline our supply chain to strengthen the core business, joint venture or other partnership opportunities, and divestiture options. We expect to complete our strategic review by the end of 2025.\n\nIn May 2025, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") contract with a commercial bank to purchase Common Stock. The Company paid $300.0 to the bank, inclusive of fees, and received 2.8 million shares in May 2025 and 0.3 million shares in August 2025 at an average total share price of $95.71. The\nCompany purchased all 3.1 million shares under the evergreen share repurchase program and used cash on hand to fund the purchase price\nIn August and September 2025, the Company executed open market purchases of 3.2 million shares for $300.0, inclusive of fees, of which $170.0 was purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program and $130.0 was purchased under the 2021 Share Repurchase Program (as defined below). The shares were purchased at an average share price of $92.81 and the Company used cash on hand to fund the open market purchases.\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\nOn July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the legislation formally titled \"An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Title II of H. Con. Res. 14” and commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”). The legislation includes several provisions that may impact the timing and magnitude of certain tax deductions. Key provisions include the permanent extension of several key elements of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including 100% bonus depreciation and domestic research cost expensing. The tax provisions in OBBBA are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations, and we expect a marginal benefit to cash flows.\nTouchland Acquisition\nOn July 16, 2025, we completed the acquisition of Touchland Holding Corp (\"Touchland\"), the developer of TOUCHLAND® hand sanitizer products (the \"Touchland Acquisition\"). We paid $656.4, net of cash acquired, and granted rights to Touchland’s founder to receive shares of our common stock valued at $50.0, with 50% of such shares vesting at each of the first and second year anniversaries of the closing. The value of common stock received by Touchland's founder will be recognized as a compensation expense ratably over the two-year vesting period if the individual continues to be employed by the Company. Payment of a $5.0 portion of the purchase price was deferred related to certain indemnification obligations provided by Touchland’s equityholders, which amount, to the extent not used in satisfaction of such indemnity obligations, is payable three years from the closing. Contingent upon the achievement of certain 2025 net sales thresholds, the Touchland Acquisition may require payment of additional earnout consideration up to a maximum of $180.0 in cash in the second quarter of 2026. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to the trade name. Touchland’s annual net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 were approximately $115.0. The Touchland Acquisition was financed with cash on hand and is managed in the Consumer Domestic and Consumer Internati\nNew Credit Agreement\nOn July 17, 2025, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s prior $1,500.0 unsecured revolving credit facility that was entered into on June 16, 2022. The aggregate commitments of the lenders under the Credit Agreement, as of the effective date, are $2,000.0, with an option to increase such commitments to $2,750.0 pursuant to the terms therein. The revolving credit facility matures on July 17, 2030, unless extended. The terms of the Credit Agreement are substantially the same as the terms for the credit facility entered into on June 16, 2022.\n\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, sales growth in the third quarter ended September 30, 2025 was driven by HERO® acne treatment products in the Global Markets Group (\"GMG\"), Canada, Germany, France, UK and Australia, THERABREATH® mouth wash in GMG and Canada, WATERPIK® Oral Care, BATISTE® dry shampoo and FEMFRESH in GMG, and ARM & HAMMER® Dental Care in Mexico. The increase in net sales for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2025, was driven HERO® acne treatment products in Canada, GMG, Europe, Germany, France, UK and Australia, THERABREATH® mouth wash in GMG and Canada, FEMFRESH in GMG and ARM & HAMMER® Baking Soda in GMG.\nConsumer International income from operations was $28.8 in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $31.8 as compared to the third quarter of 2024. Income from operations was impacted in the third quarter of 2024 by the VMS non-cash intangible and PP&E impairment charges of $29.7. Excluding the non-cash impairment charges, Consumer International income from operations increased $2.1. The increase is due primarily to the impact of higher sales volumes of $6.0, favorable price/mix of $5.0, lower manufacturing and distribution expenses "
