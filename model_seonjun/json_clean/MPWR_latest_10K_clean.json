Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel, our ability to introduce new products, our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products, and our ability to meet our end customers’ energy efficiency goals. Our industry is characterized by decreasing average selling prices over the life of a product. We compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products. In some cases, our competitors have a broader number of product offerings that may enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers and engage sales partners. We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with several manufacturers of such products. We consider our primary competitors to include Analog Devices, Infineon Technologies, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Power Integrations, Renesas Electronics, ROHM Semiconductor, Semtech, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments.\n\nWe and our supply chain, including the end products which contain our products, are also subject to import/export controls, tariffs, and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we, our supply chain or the providers of such end products, have operations or otherwise do business. Government regulations and import/export controls can be complex and are subject to change in the future, and in some cases unexpectedly, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements. Our efforts to comply with these government regulations could have material impacts on our capital expenditures, operating expenses, revenue, resource allocation, operations, competitive position, or financial condition, and the magnitude and duration of such impacts are uncertain and difficult to quantify. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of material risks related to government policies and regulations on environmental laws, international trade policies and restrictions, including tariffs on imports of foreign goods and regulations restricting the export of goods and services between the U.S. and China.\n\nIn the future, we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue to innovate while fulfilling our customers’ evolving needs, enter new market segments, obtain design wins, grow our sales in a diversified way across regions, expand our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity.\n\nOur proprietary process and packaging technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller, single-chip power management ICs. These technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of analog applications within the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer end markets. Our key product families include, but not limited to, the Direct Current (“DC”) to DC, Alternating Current (“AC”) to DC, driver metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, power management IC, current limit switch and lighting control products. Our product families are differentiated from those of our competitors with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy, power efficiency, quality and longevity, making them cost-effective and more sustainable relative to many competing solutions. For example, DC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as cloud-based and on-premises CPU servers and workstation applications, server AI applications, storage applications, notebooks, infotainment, power sources, home appliances, network infrastructure and satellite communications applications. We believe our DC to DC products are differentiated in the market, particularly with respect to their high degree of integration, high voltage operation, high load current, high switching speed, small footprint, and high energy efficiency. These features are important to our customers as they are designed to result in fewer components that need to be produced and consumed, a smaller form factor, more accurate regulation of voltages, lower power consumption and, ultimately, lower system cost, increased reliability and lower carbon emissions through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices.\n\nWe focus on the market for high performance analog and mixed-signal ICs. High performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors, which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip, greater precision, better power efficiency and density, higher speed and lower heat and noise. There are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixed-signal IC markets from digital IC markets. These factors include longer product life cycles, numerous market segments, technology that is difficult to replicate, relative complexity of design and process technologies, importance of experienced design engineers, lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets. We have targeted product and market areas that we believe allow us to operate at above-average growth over the long term compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole.\n\nWe expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market. We believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell, because our ICs typically are smaller in size, are highly integrated with lower energy consumption, and achieve higher performance specifications than most of our competitors. However, there is no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering our markets. In addition, there has historically been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. If these or future acquisitions are successful, competition may intensify, as our competitors add resources with which to compete against us.\n\nOur research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas: systems architecture, circuit design and implementation, and process technologies. In the area of systems architecture, we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities. In the area of circuit design and implementation, our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products. In the area of process technologies, we are investing in research and development resources to provide leading-edge analog power processes for our next generation of ICs. We believe process technologies are key strategic components to our future growth.\n\nOnce we secure our product positioning through our technical sales and applications engineers’ efforts, we then sell our products through third-party distributors and value-added resellers. In addition, we sell directly to certain original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) and end customers. Our third-party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us, which allow the distributors to sell our products to end customers and other resellers, including OEMs and ODMs. Our value-added resellers may second source other products and provide other services to customers. ODMs typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of OEMs.\n\nIn general, we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets. As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,917 patents/applications issued or pending, of which 608 patents have been issued in the U.S. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through December 2044. Our patents are material to our business, but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success. We also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our technology, know-how and processes. We also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate. We have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business. Despite precautions that we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. There can be no assurance that the steps we take are adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. Furthermore, the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the U.S. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims. Such litigation can be very costly and may divert our management resources. Further, we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products. In the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers, we could be enjoined from selling selected products, could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers, or could pay royalties or other damages to third parties. If any of our products are found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms, we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nBecause our sales are primarily billed and payable in U.S. dollars, our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates. However, because a majority of our revenue is attributable to sales to customers in Asia, changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, our revenue from sales to customers in Asia was 94%, 87% and 86%, respectively.\n\nWe design and develop our products for the enterprise data, storage and computing, automotive, communications, consumer, and industrial end markets. Enterprise data was our largest end market in 2024. The following table is a summary of the various key end market applications for our products, and t",
