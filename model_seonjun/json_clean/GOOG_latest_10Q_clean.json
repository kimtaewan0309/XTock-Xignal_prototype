Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as:\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\nchanges in advertising quality, formats, delivery, or policy;\nchanges in device mix;\nseasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases;\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\nother products and services.\nFluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and the timing of product launches.\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, and other services.

Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount due to factors such as annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years.\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.
