  "item7_clean": "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n2024 Executive Overview\nWe had a strong year, setting records and achieving milestones, including:\nFull year revenues hit an all-time high of $25 billion, over 15 percent higher than the prior year\nSeven consecutive quarters of record revenues\nRecord full year operating income of $3.6 billion, over 80 percent higher than the prior year\nAll-time high cash from operations of almost $6 billion\nHigher ticket prices for 2024 versus 2023 for all of our major cruise lines and onboard spending levels that accelerated sequentially each quarter throughout the year\nRecord booking trends and record year-end customer deposits, indicating a continuation of the strong momentum we’ve been experiencing for the last two years\nWe remain laser focused on further reducing interest expense and rebuilding our investment-grade balance sheet. During 2024, we made debt prepayments of over $3 billion, bringing our total prepayments to over $7 billion since the beginning of 2023. Additionally, we have reduced our debt balance by over $8 billion from the peak in January 2023, ending the year with $27.5 billion of debt.\nWe are delivering long-term value for our shareholders through improved operational execution across our cruise lines. We ended 2024 with adjusted return on invested capital (“ROIC”) comfortably above our cost of capital.\nWe welcomed three new ships during 2024:\n, the third of five Excel class vessels for Carnival Cruise Line;\n, Princess Cruises’ next generation flagship which was just awarded Conde Nast Traveler’s 2024 Mega Ship of the year in the U.S.; and\n, Cunard’s first new ship in 14 years.\nWe have also been focusing on each of our cruise lines’ unique target markets, launching new marketing campaigns across all our brands. In 2024, both new-to-cruise and repeat guests were each up double-digit percentages and we continue to attract new cruise guests as we work to increase awareness and consideration for cruise travel globally.\nWe continue to advance our enhanced destination strategy to provide guests with yet another reason to take a cruise vacation with us. Celebration Key, our new exclusive cruise port destination on Grand Bahama Island, is scheduled to open in the summer of 2025, with an additional pier opening in the fall of 2026. Its five portals built for fun will further expand our experience offerings with an abundance of features and amenities for our guests. Celebration Key will be our largest and closest destination in our portfolio, saving fuel costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we recently announced plans to enhance Half Moon Cay, our highly rated and award-winning exclusive Bahamian destination. The enhancements will lean further into this destination’s natural beauty and pristine appeal, reinforcing its new name – RelaxAway, Half Moon Cay. Featuring a newly constructed pier that is expected to be ready in the summer of 2026, the destination will allow two ships to dock, including Carnival Cruise Line’s largest ships that will be able to visit for the first time. We believe developing and promoting these unique assets will help us cast the net wider and capture even more new-to-cruise demand.\nDuring 2024, we also continued making progress towards our sustainability goals. We reduced our greenhouse gas emission intensity by approximately 17.5 percent compared to 2019, on track to achieve our targeted reduction of 20 percent by the end of 2026, a goal that was previously pulled forward by four years. We have also lowered our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by almost 10 percent since 2019, despite capacity growth of over nine percent over the same period.\nWe are grateful for the efforts of our hard working and dedicated team who delivered a step change improvement in 2024 and set us up very well for 2025 and beyond, while consistently delivering unforgettable happiness to over 13 and a half million people in 2024, by providing them with extraordinary cruise vacations while honoring the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visit and life we touch.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to our consolidated financial statements for further information on\nAccounting Pronouncements\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur critical accounting estimates are those we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our critical accounting estimates, the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows:\nWe make several critical accounting estimates with respect to our ship accounting including ship improvement costs, estimated useful lives and residual values.\nWe account for ship improvement costs, including replacements of certain significant components and parts, by capitalizing those costs that we believe add value to our ships and have a useful life greater than one year and depreciating those improvements over their estimated remaining useful life. The costs of repairs and maintenance, including those incurred when a ship is taken out-of-service for scheduled maintenance, and minor improvement costs and expenses, are charged to expense as incurred. If we change our assumptions in making our determinations as to whether improvements to a ship add value, the amounts we expense each year as repair and maintenance expense could increase, which would be partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense, resulting from a reduction in capitalized costs.\nIn addition, the specifically identified or estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of previously capitalized ship components are written-off upon retirement, which may result in a loss on disposal that is also included in other operating expenses.\nWe do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ships. In addition, since we do not separately componentize our ships, we do not identify and track depreciation of original ship components. Therefore, we typically have to estimate the net book value of components that are retired, based primarily upon their replacement cost, their age and their original estimated useful lives. Given the large size and complexity of our ships, ship accounting estimates require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain.\n\nship useful life estimate by one year at the time we took delivery or acquired each of our ships\n$260 million assuming we had estimated our ships to have no residual value\nWe believe that the estimates we made for ship accounting purposes are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied in all material respects and result in depreciation expense that is based on a rational and systematic method to equitably allocate the costs of our ships to the periods during which we use them.\nWe review our ships for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a ship may not be recoverable. When an impairment review is appropriate, such as an expected sale of a ship before the end of its useful life, impairment reviews of our ships require us to make significant estimates. We evaluate ship asset impairments at the individual ship level which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of a ship, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.\nThe estimation of a ship’s fair value includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The principal assumption used in determining the fair value of our ships tested for impairment in 2022 was the estimated sales proceeds.\nWe determined the fair value of these ships based on their respective estimated selling values, for those ships expected to be disposed of, or estimated discounted future cash flows and comparable market transactions. Where estimated future cash flows are used to estimate the recoverable value of a ship, the cash flows include estimated regulatory costs, including those related to proposed regulations, which are likely to impact costs and capital expenditures, including those expected to meet our 2030 Climate Action Goals.\nRefer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our property and equipment policy and ship impairment reviews.\nWe believe that we have made reasonable estimates.\nWe periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us, as well as for other known unasserted claims, including environmental, legal, regulatory and guest and crew matters. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these matters, we use our best judgment to determine the appropriate amounts to record in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe accrue a liability and establish a reserve when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In assessing probable losses, we make estimates of the amount of probable insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets where appropriate. Such accruals and reserves are typically based on developments to date, management’s estimates of the outcomes of these matters, our experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar matters, historical claims experience, actuarially determined estimates of liabilities and any related insurance coverage.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of these matters and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we may have made. In addition, as new information becomes available, we may need to reassess amounts accrued related to our contingencies. All such changes in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.\nRefer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of contingencies.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nWe believe the volatility in the cost of fuel is reasonably likely to continue to impact our profitability in both the short and long-term.\nWe believe the increasing global focus on climate change, including the reduction of GHG emissions and new and evolving regulatory requirements, is reasonably likely to have a material negative impact on our future financial results. We became subject to the EU Emissions Trading System (“ETS”) on January 1, 2024, which includes a three-year phase-in period. Refer to XVIII. Governmental Regulations.\nResults of Operations\nWe have historically earned substantially all of our cruise revenues from the following:\nSales of passenger cruise tickets and, in some cases, the sale of air and other transportation to and from airports near our ships’ home ports and cancellation fees. The cruise ticket price typically includes the following:\nMost meals, including snacks at numerous venues\nAccess to amenities such as swimming pools, water slides, water parks, whirlpools, a health club and sun decks\nChild care and supervised youth programs\nEntertainment, such as theatrical and comedy shows, live music and nightclubs\nVisits to multiple destinations\nSales of onboard goods and services not included in the cruise ticket price. This generally includes the following:\n• Internet and communication services\n• Specialty restaurants\n• Laundry and dry cleaning services\nThese goods and services are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires, from which we receive either a percentage of their revenues or a fee. Concession revenues do not have direct expenses because the costs and services incurred for concession revenues are borne by our concessionaires. In 2024, we earned 34% of our cruise revenues from onboard and other revenue goods and services.\nWe earn our tour and other revenues from our hotel and transportation operations and other revenues.\nWe incur cruise operating expenses for the following:\nThe costs of passenger cruise bookings, which include travel agent commissions, cost of air and other transportation, port fees, taxes, and charges that directly vary with guest head counts and credit and debit card fees\nOnboard and other cruise costs, which include the costs of beverage sales, costs of shore excursions, costs of retail sales, internet and communication costs, credit and debit card fees, other onboard costs, costs of cruise vacation protection programs and pre- and post-cruise land packages\nPayroll and related costs, which include the costs of officers and crew in bridge, engineering and hotel operations. Substantially all costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in selling and administrative expenses\nFuel costs, which include fuel delivery costs and European Union Allowance costs\nFood costs, which include both our guest and crew food costs\nOther ship operating expenses, which include port costs that do not vary with guest head counts; repairs and maintenance, including minor improvements and dry-dock expenses; hotel costs; entertainment; gains and losses on ship sales; ship impairments; freight and logistics; insurance premiums and all other ship operating expenses\nWe incur tour and other costs and expenses for our hotel and transportation operations and other expenses.\nStatistical Information\nYears Ended November 30,\nPassenger Cruise Days (“PCDs”)\nAvailable Lower Berth Days (“ALBDs”)\nOccupancy percentage (d)\nFuel consumption in metric tons\nFuel consumption in metric tons per thousand ALBDs\nFuel cost per metric ton consumed (excluding European Union Allowance)\nCurrencies (USD to 1)\nAUD\nCAD\nEUR\nGBP\nNotes to Statistical Information\nPCD represents the number of cruise passengers on a voyage multiplied by the number of revenue-producing ship operating days for that voyage.\nALBD is a standard measure of passenger capacity for the period that we use to approximate rate and capacity variances, based on consistently applied formulas that we use to perform analyses to determine the main non-capacity driven factors that cause our cruise revenues and expenses to vary. ALBDs assume that each cabin we offer for sale accommodates two passengers and is computed by multiplying passenger capacity by revenue-producing ship operating days in the period.\nIn 2024 compared to 2023, we had a 4.7% capacity increase in ALBDs comprised of a 7.9% capacity increase in our NAA segment and a 0.5% capacity decrease in our Europe segment.\nOur NAA segment’s capacity increase was caused by the following:\nCarnival Cruise Line 4,090-passenger capacity ship that transferred from Costa Cruises and entered into service in May 2023\nSeabourn 260-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in July 2023\nCarnival Cruise Line 5,360-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in December 2023\nPrincess Cruises 4,310-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in February 2024\nCarnival Cruise Line 4,130-passenger capacity ship that transferred from Costa Cruises and entered into service in April 2024\nThe increase in our NAA segment’s capacity was partially offset by a Seabourn 460-passenger capacity ship that was removed from service in September 2024.\nOur Europe segment’s capacity decrease was caused by the following:\nCosta Cruises 4,090-passenger capacity ship that transferred to Carnival Cruise Line in March 2023\nAIDA Cruises 1,270-passenger capacity ship that was removed from service in November 2023\nCosta Cruises 4,240-passenger capacity ship that transferred to Carnival Cruise Line and was removed from Costa Cruises’ fleet in February 2024\nThe Red Sea rerouting as certain ships repositioned without guests\nThe decrease in our",
