In May 2025, Abbott announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the company's Tendyne™ transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) system to treat people with mitral valve disease. In July 2025, Abbott received regulatory approval in Japan for TriClip, a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with tricuspid regurgitation, or a leaky tricuspid heart valve. In August 2025, Abbott obtained CE Mark for an expanded indication for the company's Navitor\ntranscatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system to treat people with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis who are at low or intermediate risk for open-heart surgery.\nThe gross profit margin percentage was 51.7 percent for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 51.4 percent for the third quarter of 2024, and 52.4 percent for the first nine months of 2025 compared to 51.0 percent for the first nine months of 2024. The increase in the first nine months of 2025 reflects the favorable impact of gross margin improvement initiatives, partially offset by higher costs, including tariffs, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses increased $53 million to $766 million, or 7.5 percent, in the third quarter of 2025, and increased $112 million to $2.2 billion, or 5.4 percent, in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the prior year. The increase in R&D expenses in the first nine months of 2025 was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects.\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $156 million to $3.1 billion, or 5.4 percent, in the third quarter of 2025, and increased $413 million to $9.2 billion, or 4.7 percent, in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the prior year due to higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses.\nIn 2025, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its diagnostic and medical devices businesses. In the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $197 million, of which $100 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, $38 million was recorded in Research and development, and $59 million was recorded in Selling, general, and administrative. Payments related to these actions totaled $57 million in the first nine months of 2025 and the remaining liabilities totaled $140 million at September 30, 2025. In addition, in the first nine months of 2025, Abbott recognized asset impairment charges of $25 million related to these restructuring plans.\nOther (Income) Expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net increased from $121 million of income in the third quarter of 2024 to $150 million of income in the third quarter of 2025 and increased from $222 million of income in the first nine months of 2024 to $414 million of income in the first nine months of 2025. The increase in the third quarter of 2025 reflects higher income associated with the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs and lower investment impairments. The increase in the first nine months of 2025 is primarily due to the recognition of a $143 million loss on the sale of a non-core business related to the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in the first nine months of 2025 also reflects lower investment impairments and higher income associated with the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs, partially offset by changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to previous business combinations.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $7 million to $44 million in the third quarter of 2025 and decreased by $27 million to $143 million in the first nine months of 2025. In the third quarter and the first nine months of 2025, interest expense decreased primarily as a result of the repayment of long-term debt in November 2024 and March 2025.\nTaxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, taxes on earnings include $91 million and $44 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first nine months of 2025, taxes on earnings includes approximately $460 million of tax expense related to a deferred tax asset that was recognized as a significant non-cash tax benefit in a prior year. In the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, taxes on earnings also included approximately $90 million of net tax benefit and $35 million of net tax expense, respectively, as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years.\nIn September 2023, Abbott received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (SNOD) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2019 Federal tax year in the amount of $417 million. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD relate to the reallocation of income between Abbott’s U.S. entities and its foreign affiliates. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit, in part because certain adjustments contradict methods that were agreed to with the IRS in prior audit periods. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2023.\nIn June 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2017 and 2018 Federal tax years in the amount of $192 million. The matters proposed in the 2017/2018 SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2019 SNOD. Abbott filed a petition in September 2024 with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the 2017/2018 SNOD in a manner consistent with its petition for the 2019 SNOD.\nIn October 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2020 Federal tax year assessing an additional $443 million of income tax. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2017/2018 and 2019 SNODs. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments and omissions that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. In addition to the tax assessment for the 2020 tax year, the 2020 SNOD also contested a deduction for which an estimated $440 million cash tax benefit would be available in a different taxable year as allowed under applicable U.S. tax law. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2024.\nAbbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the IRS, the IRS independent appeals process, and/or through litigation, as necessary. Abbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) has proposed a two-pillared plan for a revised international tax system. Pillar 1 proposes to reallocate taxing rights among the jurisdictions in which in-scope multinational corporations operate. Pillar 2 proposes to assess a 15 percent minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Numerous countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar 2 model rules. The enactment of current Pillar 2 model rules did not and is not projected to have a material impact to Abbott's consolidated financial statements. Abbott continues to monitor the Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 developments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $7.6 billion at December 31, 2024, to $7.5 billion at September 30, 2025, reflects the repayments of debt in September and March 2025 of $500 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and the payment of dividends and capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2025, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Working capital was $10.3 billion at September 30, 2025, and $9.5 billion at December 31, 2024. The increase in working capital in 2025 primarily reflects increases in trade receivables and inventory.\nIn the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2025 totaled $6.3 billion, an increase of $561 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher segment operating earnings. In the first nine months of 2025, Net cash from operating activities included $256 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of $1.5 billion. Net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 included $298 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of $1.2 billion.\nAt September 30, 2025, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by S&P Global Ratings and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating.\nOn September 15, 2025, Abbott repaid the $500 million outstanding principal amount of its 3.875% Notes upon maturity. On March 17, 2025, Abbott repaid the $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of its 2.95% Notes upon maturity.\nIn October 2024, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7 billion of Abbott common shares, from time to time. This authorization was in addition to the unused portion of the share repurchase program authorized in December 2021. In the third quarter of 2025, Abbott repurchased 2.4 million of its common shares for $303 million, which fully utilized the $293 million authorization remaining under the December 2021 sha"
