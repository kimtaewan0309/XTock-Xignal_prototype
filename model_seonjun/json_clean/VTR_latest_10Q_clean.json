We believe that such information is accurate and that the sources from which it has been obtained are reliable. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information and have not independently verified the assumptions on which such information is based.\nVentas, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) focused on delivering strong, sustainable shareholder returns by enabling exceptional environments that benefit a large and growing aging population. We hold a portfolio that includes senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, hospitals and healthcare facilities located in North America and the United Kingdom. As of September 30, 2025, we owned or had investments in 1,406 properties consisting of\nproperties in our reportable business segments (“Segment Properties”) and 35 properties held by unconsolidated real estate entities in our non-segment operations. Our Company is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York.\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999. Provided we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of technical requirements, which impact how we invest in, operate and manage our assets.\nWe operate through three reportable business segments: senior housing operating portfolio, which we refer to as “SHOP,” outpatient medical and research portfolio, which we refer to as “OM&R,” and triple-net leased properties, which we refer to as “NNN.” We also hold assets outside of our reportable business segments, which we refer to as non-segment assets, and which consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities include investments made through our third-party institutional private capital management platform, Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner, including our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund (the “Ventas Fund”). Our investments in unconsolidated entities also includes investments in operating entities, such as Ardent Health Partners, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Ardent”) and Atria Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Atria”).\nThe following table summarizes information for our portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 (dollars in thousands):\nPercentage of Total NOI\nSenior housing operating portfolio (SHOP)\nOutpatient medical and research portfolio (OM&R)\nTriple-net leased properties (NNN)\n______________________________\nNOI for non-segment includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional private capital management platform, income from loans and investments and corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments.\nFor more than 25 years, Ventas has pursued what we believe is a successful, enduring strategy focused on delivering outsized value to stockholders and other key stakeholders by enabling exceptional environments that benefit the aging population. Working with industry-leading care providers, partners, developers and research and medical institutions, our collaborative and experienced team is focused on achieving consistent, superior total returns through: (1) delivering profitable organic growth in senior housing, (2) capturing value-creating external growth focused on senior housing, (3) driving strong execution and cash flow generation throughout our portfolio of high-quality assets unified in serving the large and growing aging population and (4) maintaining financial strength, flexibility and liquidity.\nOur objective is to generate reliable and growing cash flows from our portfolio, which enables us to pay regular cash dividends to stockholders and creates opportunities to increase stockholder value.\nOur operations have historically been and are expected to continue to be impacted by economic and market conditions. We expect senior housing to benefit from strong supply/demand fundamentals, including robust projected demand growth combined with low projected supply growth.\nThe performance and growth of our business will also depend on the broader macroeconomic environment, including consumer sentiment, interest rates, inflation and GDP growth.\nSee “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our 2024 Annual Report for additional discussion of risks affecting our business.\nInvestments and Dispositions\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we acquired 41 senior housing communities reported in our SHOP segment for an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 billion.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we sold one senior housing community in our SHOP segment, four properties in our OM&R segment and 10 properties in our NNN segment for aggregate consideration of $168.8 million and recognized $14.4 million gain on real estate disposition.\nIn June 2025, an existing tenant exercised a legally binding and non-cancellable option to purchase 12 OM&R properties in June 2026. This transaction is accounted for as a lease modification resulting in a sales-type lease receivable of $38.5 million and a $20.8 million gain on real estate disposition. Interest income from the sales-type lease receivable will be recognized over the remaining lease term.\nIn October 2025, we acquired six senior housing communities reported in our SHOP segment for an aggregate purchase price of $161.4 million.\nLiquidity and Capital\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had $4.1 billion in liquidity, including approximately $3.5 billion of availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility, $188.6 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $417.9 million of estimated proceeds available under unsettled equity forward sales agreements, calculated using the forward price, net of fees, partially offset by $18.3 million in amounts outstanding under our uncommitted line for standby letters of credit.\nIn April 2025, we amended our unsecured revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase our borrowing capacity from $2.75 billion to $3.5 billion.\nIn August 2025, we"
