Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWe are a global aerospace and defense company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. During the nine months ended September 28, 2025, 72% of our $54.7 billion in sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 63% from U.S. Department of War (DoW), also known as the Department of Defense under 10 U.S.C. § 111(a)), and 28% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government).\nWe operate in a complex and evolving global security environment. Conflicts or tensions in areas such as Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific region have heightened tensions and highlighted security requirements globally, including in these regions as well as the U.S. Although these tensions and conflicts may drive interest in specific products or services as countries seek to improve their security posture, our business primarily operates on a long-cycle basis. As a result, the U.S. Government has been broadly focused on increasing industry capacity to meet long-term demand. We continue to work with the U.S. Government, international partners, and our supply chain to increase capacity and enhance our ability to scale our operations to anticipate potential demand, deliver critical capabilities, and replenish depleted U.S. and allied stockpiles of products that have been consumed over the past several years.\nGlobal Economic and Geopolitical Environment\nOur business and financial performance are impacted by general economic conditions including inflationary pressures, delays and disruptions in supply chains, business slowdowns or shutdowns, workforce challenges and labor shortfalls, impacts from technological change, and market volatility. These macroeconomic factors have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increased costs, delays, disruptions and other performance challenges, as well as competing demands for limited resources to address such increased costs and other challenges, for our company, our suppliers and partners, and our customers.\nWe have experienced, and continue to experience, supply chain challenges, including supplier shortages and performance issues. While on-time deliveries are improving, pressures remain in certain areas, and we are proactively working with our suppliers to meet our contract commitments. In addition, macroeconomic conditions including elevated levels of inflation present risks for us, our suppliers and the stability of the broader defense industrial base. Supply chain challenges, including both the availability and cost of goods, may be further impacted due to the imposition of tariffs and the availability of raw materials including rare earth minerals, as discussed below under “Recent Developments in Trade and Regulatory Policies.” If we experience significant supply chain issues or high rates of inflation, and are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our future profits, margins and cash flows, particularly for existing fixed-price contracts, may be adversely affected. We remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the cost competitiveness and affordability of our products and services, which may, in part, offset cost increases from inflation.\nRecent Developments in Trade and Regulatory Policies\nCertain materials and component parts that go into making our products are imported into the U.S. and are subject to tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, export and import controls, and other trade restrictions. The U.S. Government has increased, expanded, or imposed new tariffs on goods imported from various countries. We also export certain products to other countries, and several countries have increased or imposed additional tariffs in response to U.S. tariffs. The tariff environment has been dynamic in 2025, with changes occurring on an ongoing basis, and it is possible that additional developments will occur in the future, including as a result of negotiations between the U.S. and trade partners and legal challenges to the tariffs.\nThe actual impact of the tariffs is subject to a number of factors including the effective date and duration of such tariffs, changes in the amount, scope and nature of the tariffs, any countermeasures that the target countries may take, the result of negotiations between the U.S. and trade partners, how our Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers react, possible substitution effects, possible duty-free entry entitlements, the outcome of any legal challenges, and any mitigating actions that may become available. Tariffs that have been enacted or expanded by the U.S. or other countries had an impact of approximately $350 million on our cash flows for the nine months ended September 28, 2025. However, we expect a substantial portion of this impact to be recoverable over time. We are closely monitoring the situation and evaluating the potential future impacts of the imposition of the announced tariffs to our business and financial condition. At this time, excluding the near-term cash flow impact, we do not believe that the tariffs announced by the U.S. or actions taken in response to these tariffs by other countries will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operation or financial condition over the long term.\nSignificant changes in tax, trade, or other policies either in the U.S. or other countries, as well as any fluctuation in foreign exchange rates as a result of such activity, could materially increase our tax burden, the price we pay for materials and component parts, the price our customers pay, and result in delays in products received or non-delivery from our vendors as well as impact the availability of materials (including rare earth minerals), which could materially impact our business and financial results. We are pursuing available options to fully or substantially mitigate the impact of the increased tariffs or any future tariffs, including seeking exclusions, through drawbacks, refunds, recovering the costs in the pricing of our products, securing alternative sources of materials or products, or, in certain cases, qualifying for duty-free treatment. However, these actions may not be successful in fully or substantially mitigating the impact of tariffs, and, even if successful, there could continue to be a near-term volatility in cash flows due to the timing of when tariffs are paid compared to when such costs may be refunded or recovered.\nIn addition, recent government actions relating to rare earth minerals that are used in certain of our products, including U.S. Government sourcing prohibitions on the import of such minerals and the imposition of export controls on such minerals by China, have raised concerns about supply availability. We are monitoring the rare earth minerals supply chain and maintaining active engagement with our suppliers as the regulatory landscape evolves. The rare earth supply chain continues to be vulnerable to disruption due to increasing scarcity and constrained capacity, and we are developing and executing mitigation plans designed to safeguard supply and meet future delivery commitments. We believe we will continue to meet our 2025 production and delivery commitments. However, if we are unable to successfully mitigate disruptions to the availability of rare earth minerals, our future profits, margins and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nLastly, the President has issued multiple Executive Orders, including two that are intended to (i) simplify and accelerate the procurement process through an overhaul of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and its supplements and (ii) modernize the defense acquisition process by promoting commercial solutions, use of innovative acquisition authorities, and other existing streamlined processes. As the modernization of the FAR progresses, we continue to monitor any changes to the Defense Acquisition Regulation Supplement. Among the actions directed by the President is a review of major defense acquisition programs that are more than 15% behind schedule or over budget, or not aligned with the Administration’s priorities, including identifying programs for potential cancellation. While the full impact of these reforms on our business is uncertain, we are adapting to meet the changes in the Government buying behaviors. We continue to monitor and assess their effects on our business and financial results. As the U.S. Government continues to review defense programs in which we provide products and/or services, and if this review leads to a full or partial cancellation of one or more of these programs, this could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nU.S. Government Budget Environment\nOur primary customer is the U.S. Government, from which we derived 72% of our sales during the nine months ended September 28, 2025, including 63% from the DoW. Funding for U.S. Government programs is subject to a variety\nof factors that can affect our business, including the administration’s budget requests and procurement priorities and policies, annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes, and other U.S. Government domestic and international priorities.
