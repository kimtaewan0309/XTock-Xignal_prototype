  "item1_clean": "ITEM 1:\nBUSINESS\nFounded in 1995 in San Jose, California, eBay Inc. is a global commerce leader that connects people and builds communities to create economic opportunity for all. Our technology empowers millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world, providing everyone the opportunity to grow and thrive. Our Marketplace platforms, including our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its localized counterparts, our off-platform marketplaces and our suite of mobile apps, together, create one of the world's largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. In 2024, eBay enabled $75 billion of Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”).\nAs a global commerce leader and third-party marketplace, our technologies and services are designed to provide buyers choice and a breadth of relevant inventory from around the globe, and to enable sellers’ access to eBay’s 134 million buyers worldwide. Our business model and pricing are designed so our business is successful when our sellers are successful. We earn revenue primarily through fees collected on paid sales, inclusive of payment processing and first-party advertising.\neBay’s strategy is to leverage technology to enhance the marketplace experience for our customers, drive growth in GMV, increase the rate of revenue growth through our advertising initiatives, and deliver healthy operating margins. Beginning in 2020, we embarked on a multi-year journey to build more compelling category experiences for enthusiastic consumers, to become the partner of choice for sellers, and to strengthen trust in relationships with buyers on our Marketplace platforms. In 2023, we evolved our strategy to focus on reinventing the future of ecommerce for enthusiasts. We derived a majority of GMV in 2024 from the following product categories: parts & accessories, collectibles, fashion, electronics, and home & garden.\nSince late 2021, eBay has managed payments for all transactions on our Marketplace platforms, delivering intuitive end-to-end payment experiences for our current and next-generation customers. Our customers enjoy significant choice and flexibility in how they pay and get paid on our Marketplace platforms. Additionally, we are continuing to launch and expand services such as eBay Balance, Express Payouts, and Seller Capital to cater to the needs of our customers and drive greater marketplace engagement.\nWe are focused on growing our first-party advertising revenue while reducing our focus on non-strategic, third-party advertising. We currently offer several advertising solutions to our sellers, including: Promoted Listings, Promoted Offsite, and Promoted Stores. Through these offerings, we aim to provide sellers with data-driven recommendations to improve their conversion and drive velocity. We are also actively testing and building more technology features to simplify the advertising experience, increase listing visibility, and drive continued business growth.\nWe have acquired and disposed of a significant number of businesses, technologies, services and products, and we maintain investments in certain businesses. We regularly review and manage our investments to ensure they support eBay’s strategic direction and complement our disciplined approach to value creation, profitability, and capital allocation. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions as part of our\nstrategy, including business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures.\nOur Customer Offerings\nWe provide a number of features for our sellers and buyers that align with our approach of leveraging technology, including generative AI (“Gen AI”), to enhance the marketplace experience for our customers. These offerings are designed to build trust and confidence on our Marketplace platforms and drive GMV.\nFor sellers, we are focused on simplifying their business processes to help drive their sales effectively and efficiently, and we continuously invest in technology to enhance the quality of selling experiences and products to expand the seller tools ecosystem. In 2024, we expanded our new magical listing experience to more sellers in more markets, saving them time and effort as they create their listings. We also launched a redesigned advertising dashboard across our global markets to enable sellers to have a more cohesive, streamlined view of their advertising reach, spend, and other metrics, giving them more tools to make the best decisions for their businesses. The dashboard enhances the advertising experience for sellers, providing artificial intelligence (“AI”) driven insights and personalized recommendations to help sellers grow their businesses. Additionally, we offer the eBay International Shipping program for sellers in the United States, surfacing millions of listings to buyers across more than 190 markets while removing the friction of international shipping and customs formalities.\nFor buyers, we are changing the way they find inventory through discovery, personalization and other innovative experiences. We are utilizing AI to transform the shopping experience for buyers. In 2024, we launched Shop the Look, which leverages Gen AI to create shoppable content and fashion recommendations. We also launched Explore, an AI-powered shopping feed enabling users to browse a nearly unlimited list of personalized recommendations based on their interests, style preferences, and sizes. We intend to continue to invest in AI and Gen AI to improve the quality of our buying and selling experiences.\nAdditionally, we have continued to strengthen our buyers’ confidence and trust in our services. We offer “eBay Money Back Guarantee,” which allows buyers to receive their money back if the item they ordered does not arrive, is faulty or damaged, or does not match the listing. eBay Money Back Guarantee covers most items purchased on the eBay Marketplace platforms in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Canada, France, Italy and Spain through a qualifying payment method. In addition, eBay authenticates eligible luxury and collectible items in six categories through “Authenticity Guarantee,” an authentication service available in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Canada, and Japan. In our parts & accessories category, we offer tools that drive trusted and convenient transactions, including fitment to ensure that buyers can find the right parts to fit their vehicles and select installation services that make maintenance and repairs easier. We also continue to expand our eBay Refurbished offering, a dedicated destination that brings inventory from pre-selected brands and top-rated sellers with standardized condition grading, to meet consumer demand for top products backed by a warranty.\nOur Impact and Responsibility\neBay’s purpose is to empower people and create economic opportunity for all through our technology for our global community of users. Every day, people build businesses on our Marketplace platforms. With a low cost of entry for sellers, we offer a highly accessible way for all types of users to interact in a global marketplace that’s inclusive and connects people of all backgrounds. Accordingly, we prioritize our corporate responsibility efforts to impact the areas of economic empowerment and sustainable commerce. Key economic programs include eBay for Charity, the eBay Foundation and our small business enablement efforts, such as our Up & Running Grants program.\neBay for Charity empowers buyers and sellers to support charities around the world. In 2024, eBay for Charity partnered with the GLIDE Foundation, the Elton John AIDS Foundation, World Central Kitchen, Six Degrees Org, Deckaid, and Homes for Our Troops, amongst others. In 2024, more than $192 million was raised by buyers and sellers to support charities via eBay for Charity.\nThe eBay Foundation helps to build economically vibrant and thriving communities. During 2024, the eBay Foundation granted nearly $18 million through strategic grantmaking and our employee gift-matching program, primarily to support historically excluded entrepreneurs. To date, the eBay Foundation has awarded nearly $140 million to more than 1,800 nonprofits.\nRecommerce has been an integral part of eBay’s purpose since the Company was founded in 1995. As a pioneer of the circular economy, eBay has created an online marketplace where people can buy and sell pre-owned goods. This helps preserve the world’s natural resources by avoiding a portion of the carbon emissions, water, energy and waste typically used in producing new goods.\nIn 2024, eBay sourced 100% of its electricity consumption for eBay-controlled offices and data centers from renewable sources, reaching our 2025 renewable energy goal one year early. eBay has also set emissions reduction targets, including near- and long-term science-based targets, and a 2045 net-zero target, that have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. In 2024, eBay was ranked in the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Green Power Partnership National Top 100 and Top 30 Tech & Telecom for the fifth year. In 2024, eBay was also recognized for its commitment to sustainability and responsible business by its inclusion in the Dow Jones Best-in-Class World and North American Indices (formerly known as the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices) for the sixth straight year.\nFinancial Information\nWe measure our footprint in our addressable market according to GMV. GMV consists of the total value of all paid transactions between users on our Marketplace platforms during the applicable period inclusive of shipping fees and taxes. In 2024, we generated $75 billion in GMV, of which 49 percent was generated outside the United States. We believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall volume of paid transactions that flow through our Marketplace platforms in a given period.\nAt the end of 2024, eBay had 134 million active buyers and 2.3 billion live listings globally. The term “active buyer” means, as of any date, all buyer accounts that paid for a transaction on our Marketplace platforms within the previous 12-month period. Buyers may register more than once and, as a result, may have more than one account.\nWe generate net revenues through two activities, Marketplace activities which primarily consist of commissions from the service of connecting buyers and sellers on our secure and trusted Marketplace platforms and Advertising activities, which primarily consist of fees charged to sellers to promote their listings. The majority of our revenue comes from a take rate on the GMV of transactions paid on our Marketplace platforms. We define “take rate” as net revenues divided by GMV.\nOur Marketplace platforms are designed to enable our buyers and sellers to leverage our economies of scale and capital investments in sales and marketing, mobile, customer acquisition, technology innovation and customer service.\nWe encounter vigorous competition in our business from numerous sources. Our users can list, sell, buy, and pay for similar items through a variety of competing online, mobile and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, directories, search engines, commerce participants (consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and business-to-business), shopping channels and networks. As our product offerings continue to broaden into new categories of items and new commerce formats, we expect to face additional competition from other online, mobile and offline channels for those new offerings. We compete on the basis of numerous factors, including price, product selection and services, and geographical reach.\nFor more information reg",
  "item7_clean": "As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments, in an aggregate amount of $7.2 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include cash held on behalf of customers related to marketplace activity of $763 million and $481 million, respectively, which are recognized separately within “Customer accounts and funds receivable” with a corresponding liability within “Customer accounts and funds payable” in our consolidated balance sheet. These amounts also do not include restricted cash related to safeguarding customer funds, our global sabbatical program, and other compensation arrangements held in escrow totaling $90 million and $27 million, respectively. We believe these assets together with cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our material cash requirements over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.\nGeopolitical events, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange rate volatility, elevated interest rates and global economic uncertainty have caused material disruptions in both the United States and international financial markets and economies and are uncertain in duration. The impact of these events has increased, and may continue to increase, our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The future impact of these events cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot assure that we will have access to external financing at times and on terms we consider acceptable, or at all, or that we will not experience other liquidity issues going forward.\nWe have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following sections summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments.\nIn 2024, we repaid the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding 3.450% senior notes on the date of maturity.\nIn 2023, we repaid the $1.2 billion\naggregate principal amount of our\nfloating rate and 2.750% senior notes on the date of maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had fixed-rate senior notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $7.0 billion, with $1.2 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the senior notes totaled an aggregate of $2.1 billion, with an aggregate of $223 million payable within 12 months. The net proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, capital expenditures, share repurchases, repayment of indebtedness and acquisitions.\nWe have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. In 2024, we issued and repaid $180 million of commercial paper notes with original maturities less than 90 days and issued $450 million of commercial paper notes with original maturities greater than 90 days. As of December 31, 2024, we had $450 million aggregate principal amount of commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.10% per annum, and a weighted average remaining term of 144 days.\nIn January 2025, we repaid the $450 million aggregate principal amount of the previously outstanding commercial paper notes on the date of maturity.\nWe have a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $1.0 billion. Funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and will bear interest at either (i) a customary forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate published by CME Group for the relevant interest period plus an adjustment of 0.1% or (ii) a customary base rate formula, plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 0% to 0.375%. The covenants of the credit agreement are discussed in “Note 10 — Debt” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. As of December 31, 2024, we had $450 million aggregate principal amount of commercial paper notes outstanding; therefore, $1.6 billion of borrowing capacity was available for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.\nWe have operating leases for office space, data centers, as well as other corporate assets that we utilize under lease arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $544 million, with $142 million payable within 12 months. For additional details related to our leases, please see “Note 11 — Leases” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (including for computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services, and construction contracts) and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2024, we had purchase obligations of $86 million, with $64 million payable within 12 months.\nThe timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. We expect the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced within the next 12 months by at least $170 million.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our assets classified as cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term and long-term non-equity investments included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling $1.6 billion. As we repatriate these funds to the United States, we will be required to pay income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs. We have accrued deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the United States. For additional details related to our income taxes, please see “Income Tax Provision” in our Results of Operations above and “Note 15 — Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOur stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count and return value to stockholders. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.\nWe expect to continue making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties. However, our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.\nIn February and December 2024, our Board authorized an incremental $2.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, under our stock repurchase program in addition to the $4.0 billion previously authorized in 2022. Our stock repurchase program has no expiration from the date of authorization.\nDuring 2024, we repurchased $3.1 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2024, a total of $3.3 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock. See “Note 13 — Stockholders’ Equity” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information about our stock repurchase program.\nWe paid a total of $533 million and $528 million in cash dividends in 2024 and 2023, respectively. In February 2025, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.29 per share of common stock to be paid on March 28, 2025 to stockholders of record as of March 14, 2025.\nOther Capital Resource Requirements\nWe actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety of principal and secondarily on improving yield on these assets. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various counterparties in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these counterparties fail or encounter difficulties. To date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of the impact of geopolitical events, inflationary pressure and foreign exchange rate volatility. At any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are deposited and invested with third party financial institutions.\nWe have entered into various indemnification agreements and, in the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these various indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recognized in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively. See “Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information about our indemnification provisions.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other disclosures included in this report.\nWe may enter into certain revenue contracts that include promises to transfer multiple goods or services, including discounts on future services. We also may enter into arrangements to purchase services from certain customers. As a result, significant interpretation and judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions, including: (1) whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct performance obligation; (3) whether revenue should be reported gross (as eBay is acting as a principal), or net (as eBay is acting as an agent); (4) evaluating whether a promotion or incentive is a payment to a customer; and (5) whether the arrangement would be characterized as revenue or reimbursement of costs incurred. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition.\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Tax positions are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty based on the estimated probability of sustaining the position under examination. Our income tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred tax benefit derived from the amortization of our intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. The deferred tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. Management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. As of December 31, 2024, we had a valuation allowance on certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by ",
