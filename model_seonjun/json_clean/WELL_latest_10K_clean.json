  "item1_clean": "We are party to agreements to develop or redevelop properties funded through capital that we and/or our joint venture partners provide. We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us. The amount capitalized is based on the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our company-wide cost of financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. The construction period commences once expenditures for the property have been made and activities necessary to get the property ready for its intended use are in progress and terminates when the applicable property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. During the construction period, we advance funds in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require, among other things, periodic site visits by a company representative. During the construction period, we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of holding back a portion of the development fee, requiring a credit support for cost-overrun obligations and/or completion guarantees. As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding construction investments of $1,219,720,000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately $540,297,000 to complete construction for consolidated investment properties. We also provide for construction loans which, depending on the terms and conditions, could be treated as loans or investments in unconsolidated entities.\nOur real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income, principal amortization and transaction fees. Real estate loans consist of mortgage loans and other real estate loans which are primarily collateralized by a first, second or third mortgage lien, a leasehold mortgage on, or an assignment of the partnership interest in the related properties, corporate guarantees and/or personal guarantees. Non-real estate loans are generally corporate loans with no real estate backing. As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding loans, net of allowances, of $2,027,586,000 with an interest yield of approximately 10.3% per annum. Our yield on loans depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments. The loans outstanding as of December 31, 2024 are generally subject to one to 15-year terms with principal amortization schedules and/or balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nInvestments in entities that we do not consolidate but for which we can exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2024, we had investments in unconsolidated entities of $1,768,772,000. Our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10% to 95% in real estate assets. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations. The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest, inclusive of transaction costs. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based on a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded.\nIn Substance Real Estate\nAdditionally, we provide loans to third parties for the acquisition, development and construction of real estate. Under these arrangements, it is possible that we will participate in the expected residual profits of the project through the sale, refinancing or acquisition of the property. We evaluate the characteristics of each arrangement, including its risks and rewards, to determine whether they are more similar to those associated with a loan or an investment in real estate. Arrangements with characteristics implying real estate joint ventures are treated as in substance real estate investments, accounted for using the equity method and are presented as investments in unconsolidated entities. We have made loans related t\no 25 properties with a carrying value of $941,216,000\nas of December 31, 2024, which are classified as in substance real estate investments.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control, through voting rights or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nAt inception of joint venture transactions, we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”) and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, \"Consolidations,\" requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated. This evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance.\nFor investments in joint ventures, U.S. GAAP may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partner(s). We assess the limited partners’ rights and their impact on our consolidation conclusions and we reassess if there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests, or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. We similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies.\nWe utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments. For short-term purposes, we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility or issue commercial paper. We typically replace these borrowings with long-term capital such as senior unsecured notes or common stock. When terms are deemed favorable, we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. In addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. In certain agreements with our lenders, we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness.\nWe compete with other real estate investment trusts, real estate partnerships, private equity and hedge fund investors, banks, insurance companies, finance/investment companies, government-sponsored agencies, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds, healthcare operators, developers and other investors in the acquisition, development, leasing and financing of healthcare and seniors housing properties. We compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships, certainty of execution, investment structures and underwriting criteria. Our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends, availability of acceptable investment opportunities, our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations.\nThe operators/tenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets. Operators/tenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of properties, location, services offered, family preferences (including a preference for home health services instead of residing in one of our communities), physicians, staff and price. We also face competition from other healthcare facilities for tenants, such as physicians and other healthcare providers that provide comparable facilities and services.\nSustainability Approach\nWe strive to operate in a responsible, transparent and sustainable manner. Our leadership, through the cross-functional Sustainability Steering Committee and the Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), through the Nominating Corporate/Governance Committee, oversees and advances our sustainability initiatives. Our corporate responsibility and sustainability strategy is focused on adopting leading sustainability practices across our business and we were recognized for our leadership in this space over the past year in the following ways:\nAchieved a MSCI ESG (\"Environmental, Social and Governance\") rating of AA;\nRecognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Energy as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for the sixth consecutive year and maintained the level of Sustained Excellence, the EPA’s highest recognition within the ENERGY STAR program, for the fourth consecutive year;\nMaintained top 30% (3rd decile) ISS Quality Score ranking for each of Environment and Social\nNamed to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the sixth consecutive year;\nMaintained Prime status under the ISS-ESG Corporate Rating for the sixth consecutive year;\nMaintained GRESB Green Star status for the fourth consecutive year; and\nRecognized for industry-leading governance practices, including #1 ranking from Green Street Advisors for Corporate Governance amongst all US REITs.\nWe are committed to operating in a sustainable manner that helps to reduce our environmental impact. Our goal is prudent environmental stewardship with a focus on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, water usage and waste production; mitigating climate-related risks; and implementing energy efficiency, water efficiency and renewable energy technologies across our portfolio. We work with our stakeholders, including employees, vendors, operators, residents and tenants, in an effort to meet these objectives by encouraging and following evolving practices of environmental sustainability, including benchmarking our portfolio in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, obtaining green building certifications, implementing energy efficient technologies and performing portfolio-wide physical and transition risk analyses to identify opportunities to help mitigate these risks.\nOur sustainability team is focused on investing in property improvement projects which meet the various objectives of our stakeholders, including providing an appropriate risk-adjusted return. The sustainability team is embedded within our asset management team, enabling them to create project scopes and specifications for energy saving component replacements and upgrades within our normal replacement schedules and when the economic benefits of the additional investment is optimized. Our review and approval process of these projects is stringent and includes using the actual meter readings and/or specialized equipment to estimate and later track the water and energy savings of the work completed.\nIn the past, we have also issued \"green\" bonds to fund green building development projects.\nWe value and are committed to our employees. We believe that a diverse workplace promotes equal opportunity, produces a variety of perspectives, motivates empl",
  "item7_clean": "Senior unsecured notes\nUnsecured credit facility and commercial paper program\nThe change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments, as well as the movement in foreign exchange rates and related hedge activity. Please refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The change in interest expense on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. Please refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. Loan expenses represent the amortization of costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured notes issuances.\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were 2.95%\n2.70% and 2.57%, respectively. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily driven by compensation costs associated with increased employee headcount. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we also recognized $29,838,000 as a cumulative catch up of stock compensation expense due to the change in the probability of achievement of specific performance goals related to special nonrecurring performance-based stock option and restricted stock awards granted in December 2021 and January 2022. Please refer to Note 15 for additional information related to these grants.\nOther expenses includes noncapitalizable legal expenses. The provision for income taxes primarily relates to state taxes, foreign taxes and taxes based on income generated by entities that are structured as taxable REIT subsidiaries.\nLoss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net is primarily attributable to the mark-to-market of the equity warrants received as part of the HC-One Group transactions that closed in 2021 and 2023.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders, as defined by U.S. GAAP, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider FFO, NOI, SSNOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (\"FFO\") as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means NICS, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and acquisitions of controlling interests, and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.\nNOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining, and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to managers, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent general overhead costs that are unrelated to property operations and unallocable to the properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits related to corporate employees, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. Same store NOI (\"SSNOI\") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. We believe the drivers of property level NOI for both consolidated properties and unconsolidated properties are generally the same and therefore, we evaluate SSNOI based on our ownership interest in each property (\"Welltower Share\"). To arrive at Welltower's Share, NOI is adjusted by adding our minority ownership share related to unconsolidated properties and by subtracting the minority partners' noncontrolling ownership interests for consolidated properties. We do not control investments in unconsolidated properties and while we consider disclosures at Welltower Share to\n\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTo mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process, including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs and market conditions, among other things. We evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.\nIn addition to our asset management and research efforts, we aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guarantees and/or letters of credit. Also, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, resident fees and services and rental income represented 75%\n20% of total revenues, respectively. Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.\nOur primary sources of cash include resident fees and services revenue, rental income and interest receipts, interest earned on short-term deposits, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, issuances of debt and equity securities including through our ATM Program (as defined below), proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.\nWe also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from NOI and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. Given the general economic conditions during 2023 and 2024, investments were generally funded proactively via issuances of common stock.\nDepending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. It is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program or issue debt or equity securities, including through our ATM Program. At December 31, 2024, we had $3,506,586,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $204,871,000 of restricted cash and $5,000,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nThe following summarizes key capital transactions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024:\n\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and other item\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated entities\nGain (loss) on real estate dispositions and acquisitions of controlling interests, net\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\nSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.\nRental income increased due primarily to acquisitions and construction conversions that occurred during 2023 and 2024. Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If the Consumer Price Index does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Our leases could renew above or below current rental rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our consolidated Outpatient Medical portfolio signed 384,643 square feet of new leases and 1,992,131 square feet of renewals. The weighted average term of these leases was eight years, with a rate of $42.22 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $30.50 per square foot. Substantially all of these leases contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from 2.0% to 6.5%.\nThe fluctuations in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions that occurred during 2023 and 2024. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly.\nThe following is a summary of our SSNOI at Welltower share for the Outpatient Medical segment (dollars in thousands):\n\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe increase in other income for the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily due to interest earned on deposits. Property operating expenses represent insurance costs related to our captive insurance company, which acts as a direct insurer of property level insurance coverage for our portfolio.\nThe following is a summary of our Non-segment/Corporate interest expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\noutstanding forward sales agreements. Depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.\nIn connection with the filing of the Shelf Form S-3, Welltower also filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement that will continue an offering that was previously covered by a prior registration statement relating to the registration of up to\nares of common stock of Welltower Inc. (the \"DownREIT II Shares\") that may be issued from time to time if, and to the extent that, certain holders of Class A units (the \"DownREIT II Units\") of HCN G&L DownREIT II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \"DownREIT II\"), tender such DownREIT II Units for redemption by the DownREIT II, and HCN DownREIT Member, LLC, a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Welltower (including its permitted successors and assigns, the \"Managing Member\"), or a designated affiliate of the Managing Member, elects to assume the redemption obligations of the DownREIT II and to satisfy all or a portion of the redemption consideration by issuing DownREIT II Shares to the holders instead of or in addition to paying a cash amount. On July 22, 2022, Welltower filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement relating to the registration of up to 300,026 shares of common stock of Welltower Inc. that may be issued from time to time if, and to the extent that, certain holders of Class A Common Units (the \"OP Units\") of Welltower OP tender the OP Units for redemption by Welltower OP, and Welltower Inc. elects to assume the redemption obligations of Welltower OP and to satisfy all or a portion of the redemption consideration by issuing shares of its common stock to the holders instead of or in addition to paying a cash amount. On October 8, 2024, Welltower filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement relating to the registration of up to 23,471,419 shares of common stock of Welltower Inc. (the \"Exchanged Shares\") that may, under certain circumstances, be issuable upon exchange of 2.750% exchangeable senior notes due 2028 or 3.125% exchangeable senior notes due 2029 of Welltower OP and the resale from time to time by the recipients of the Exchanged Shares.\nSupplemental Guarantor Information\nWelltower OP has issued the unsecured notes described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. All unsecured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Welltower, and Welltower OP is 99.707% owned by Welltower as of December 31, 2024. Effective January 4, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements applicable to registered debt offerings that include certain credit enhancements. We have adopted these new rules, which permits subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent to omit separate financial statements if the consolidated financial statements of the parent company have been filed, the subsidiary obligor is a consolidated subsidiary of the parent company, the guaranteed security is debt or debt-like, and the security is guaranteed fully and unconditionally by th",
