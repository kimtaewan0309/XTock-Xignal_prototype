They then sell them to consumers in relatively small quantities for personal use.\nInstitutional pharmacies\naddress the unique needs of hospitals, nursing homes and other such venues. Among the services provided are specialized packaging, including for injectables and unit-dose products, for controlled administration.\nMail-order and e-commerce pharmacies\nreceive prescriptions by mail, fax, phone or the internet at a central location; process them in large, mostly automated centers; and mail the drugs to the consumer.\nSpecialty pharmacies\nfocus on managing the handling and service requirements associated with high-cost and more-complex drug therapies, such as those used to treat patients with rare or serious diseases.\nViatris has four reportable segments: Developed Markets, Greater China, JANZ, and Emerging Markets. The Company reports segment information on the basis of markets and geography, which reflects its focus on bringing its large and diversified portfolio of branded and generic products, including complex products, to people in markets everywhere.\nThe Developed Markets segment comprises our operations primarily in North America and Europe. The Company’s business in North America is driven mainly by operations in the U.S., where the Company is one of the largest providers of prescription medicines. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry is very competitive, and the primary means of competition are innovation and development, timely FDA approval, manufacturing and supply chain capabilities, product quality, marketing, portfolio size, customer service, reputation and price. Viatris relies on a flexible and cost-effective supply chain to meet the rapidly changing needs of its customers around a reliable, high-quality supply of pharmaceutical products. Europe, where many governments provide healthcare at a low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels, continues to be a highly competitive market, especially in terms of pricing, quality standards, service levels and product portfolio. Viatris’ leadership position in a number of countries provides the Company a platform to fulfill the needs of patients, physicians, pharmacies, customers and payors.\nSignificant products sold by the Developed Markets segment include Lyrica®, Lipitor®, Creon®, Influvac®, Wixela Inhub®, EpiPen® Auto-Injector, Fraxiparine®, and Yupelri®.\nNew product launches are an important growth driver. Important recent launches include Breyna™ and lisdexamfetamine in the U.S., and Rivaroxaban in certain European markets.\nWhile Viatris’ U.S. customer base is extensive, it comprises a small number of very large firms as the pharmaceutical industry has undergone tremendous change and consolidation. Viatris believes it is well positioned to serve such customers in the Developed Markets due to the scale it has built in terms of R&D, supply chain, and portfolio breadth.\n\nThe table below displays the percentage of consolidated net sales to our largest customers during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nPercentage of Consolidated Net Sales\nMcKesson Corporation\nCencora, Inc. (formerly AmerisourceBergen Corporation)\nCardinal Health, Inc.\nNet sales represented less than 10% of consolidated net sales during the period.\nWe serve our customers through a team of highly-skilled sales and marketing professionals, all of whom are focused on establishing Viatris as our customers’ partner of choice. To best meet customers’ needs, the Company manages its business on a geographic basis.\nIn addition to being dynamic, the pharmaceutical industry is complex. How it functions, how it is regulated and how it provides patients access varies by location. Similarly, competition is affected by many factors. Examples of factors include innovation and development, timely approval of prescription drugs by health authorities, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, marketing effectiveness, portfolio size, customer service, consumer acceptance, product price, political stability and the availability of funding for healthcare.\nCertain parts of our business also are affected by seasonality, e.g., due to the timing and severity of peak cough, cold and flu incidence, which can cause variability in sales trends for some of our products. While seasonality may affect quarterly comparisons within a fiscal year, it generally is not material to our annual consolidated results.\nFor these and other reasons, the Company’s sales and marketing efforts vary accordingly by product, market and channel type, each of which is described below.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nFrom cardiovascular health to oncology, Viatris offers quality treatment options across more than 10 major therapeutic areas covering a wide variety of noncommunicable and infectious diseases. We also offer support services such as diagnostic clinics, educational seminars and digital tools to help patients better manage their health. We offer a broad and diverse range of treatment options across all our therapeutic areas, with many categories containing several products in a range of dosage forms, formulations and delivery systems that allow physicians to tailor care for optimal treatment.\nAs the Company looks to the future, Viatris’ goal is to leverage its proven scientific capabilities to create a durable and higher-margin portfolio of products. Viatris intends to continue building its pipeline and focusing on products with greater complexity while also investing in the lifecycle management of certain key products in our current portfolio. The Company is also expanding further beyond its current scope into more innovative products, including innovative, best-in-class, patent-protected assets that address areas of significant unmet medical need. The Company is further enhancing its commercial and scientific capabilities as needed for this future portfolio and intends to increase its R&D investment as well as inorganically grow via business development through its Global Healthcare Gateway®.\nViatris currently markets prescription branded and generic drugs, including complex drugs.\nare typically prescription\n\nThe manufacturing of API and finished dosage forms is currently performed by a combination of internal and external manufacturing operations. After completing the divestiture of our API business in India, we continue to maintain some selective R&D capabilities in API and believe we have access to adequate API supplies through a manufacturing and supply agreement with the API business buyer and our arrangements with other manufacturers. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors - “\nWe have a limited number of manufacturing facilities and certain third-party suppliers produce a substantial portion of our API and products, some of which require a highly exacting and complex manufacturing process.\nThe Company’s significant manufacturing, warehousing and distribution activities are located primarily in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Singapore, India, Australia, China, and certain EU countries, including Ireland. In addition, we maintain administrative facilities around the world. While many of these key facilities are owned, Viatris also leases certain facilities from third parties.\nThe Company believes all its facilities are in good operating condition, the machinery and equipment are well-maintained, the facilities are suitable for their intended purposes, and they have capacities adequate for the current operations.\nFacilities and records related to our products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where the Company’s products are marketed. In addition, authorities often conduct pre-approval plant inspections to determine whether the Company’s systems and processes comply with current GMP and other regulations, and clinical-trial reviews to evaluate regulatory compliance and data integrity. Our suppliers, contract manufacturers, clinical trial partners and other business partners are subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections. The Company remains committed to maintaining the highest quality manufacturing standards at its facilities around the world and to continuous assessment and improvement in a time of evolving industry dynamics and regulatory expectations.\nFollowing an inspection by the FDA at our oral finished dose manufacturing facility in Indore, India in 2024, the FDA has issued a warning letter, and an import alert related to this facility. The import alert affects 11 actively distributed products that will no longer be accepted into the U.S. until the warning letter is lifted. It makes exceptions, subject to certain conditions, for four products based on shortage concerns. Following recently concluded discussions with the FDA, the Company does not expect additional product exceptions to be granted by the FDA.\nFollowing the substance of FDA’s original inspection observations, the Company immediately implemented a comprehensive remediation plan at the site. The necessary corrective and preventive actions are well underway, including but not limited to related personnel actions. Additionally, we have engaged independent third-party subject matter experts to support the remediation plan.\nWe have been in regular communication with FDA during this process and will continue to work to ensure that the FDA is satisfied with the steps we have taken to resolve all the points raised. Our responses to the warning letter and import alert were submitted within the required time periods.\nWhile product continues to be shipped from the Indore facility to markets outside the U.S., some impact in other markets, including the ARV business in Emerging Markets and select generic products in Europe, is anticipated. The Company currently estimates the negative impact to 2025 total revenues to be approximately $500 million and to 2025 earnings from operations to be approximately $385 million.\nWe take very seriously our continued and comprehensive oversight of our entire manufacturing network. Patient safety remains our primary and unwavering focus. We will work closely with our customers to mitigate any possible supply disruptions and meet the needs of the patients we serve.\nFor additional information, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors - “\nThe pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, and we face significant costs and uncertainties associated with our efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nCustomers and Marketing\nOur customers include retail and pharmacy establishments, wholesalers and distributors, payers, insurers and governments, and institutions, such as hospitals, among others. See “Channel Types” below for more information about our customers.\n\nsold under an approved proprietary name for marketing purposes. Brand products often become branded generics once patent protections or other forms of exclusivity expire. Branded generic products are common in many countries outside the U.S., including emerging markets. Brand and branded generic products are more sensitive to promotion than are unbranded generic products. They therefore represent the primary focus of most of our sales representatives and product-level marketing activity. Our remaining OTC products, which are sold directly to consumers without a prescription and without reimbursement, are generally sold under a brand name.\nare therapeutically equivalent versions of brand drugs. Generics generally become available once the patents and other exclusivities on their branded counterparts expire. The generics business is generally characterized by lower margins on higher volumes of a relatively large number of products. Our generic medicines work in the same way and provide the same clinical benefits as their as their brand-name counterparts and may cost less, providing patients and the h",
  "item7_clean": "Emerging Markets Segment\nNet sales from Emerging Markets decreased by $300.9 million or 12% for the year ended December 31, 2024 when compared to the prior year. Net sales decreased by approximately $294.6 million, or 12%, due to the inclusion of net sales in the prior year period related to divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024. The decrease in net sales was also partially driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $116.2 million, or 5%. Constant currency net sales from the remaining business increased by approximately $109.9 million, or 4%, when compared to the prior year, primarily driven by new products and higher net sales of existing products in certain Latin American, Middle Eastern and Asian countries.\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit\nCost of sales increased from $8.99 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $9.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in cost of sales was largely driven by IPR&D intangible asset impairment charges of $177.1 million. Refer to Note 8\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $5.62 billion and gross margins were 38%. For the year ended December 31, 2023, gross profit was $6.44 billion and gross margins were 42%. The changes in gross profit and gross margins are primarily related to the impact of the divestitures and the IPR&D intangible asset impairment charges. Adjusted gross margins were approximately 58% for the year ended December 31, 2024, essentially flat when compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nA reconciliation between cost of sales, as reported under U.S. GAAP, and adjusted cost of sales and adjusted gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions, except %s)\nU.S. GAAP cost of sales\nPurchase accounting amortization and other related items\nAcquisition and divestiture-related costs\nRestructuring-related costs\nShare-based compensation expense\nAdjusted cost of sales\nAdjusted gross profit\nAdjusted gross margin\nAdjusted gross profit is calculated as total revenues less adjusted cost of sales. Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenues.\nResearch and Development Expense\nR&D expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $808.7 million, essentially flat compared to R&D expense of $805.2 million for the prior year. An increase in spend on the selatogrel and cenerimod programs was partially offset by lower spending on base business programs. We expect R&D expense to increase in excess of $100 million in 2025 as compared to 2024 primarily as a result of increased expenses for the selatogrel and cenerimod development programs.\n\nThe Company records contingent consideration liabilities resulting from business acquisitions or divestitures at its estimated fair value on the acquisition or divestiture date. Each reporting period thereafter, the Company revalues these obligations and records increases or decreases in their fair value as adjustments to litigation settlements and other contingencies, net within the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates, payment periods and adjustments in the probability of achieving future development steps, regulatory approvals, market launches, operating results, sales targets and profitability. These fair value measurements represent Level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market.\nSignificant judgment is employed in determining the assumptions utilized as of the acquisition or divestiture date and for each subsequent measurement period. Accordingly, changes in the assumptions described above could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based on management’s assessment of the fair value of the Company’s reporting units as compared to their related carrying value. Under the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to use qualitative factors and determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test would be required. The goodwill impairment test requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount is less than its fair value, then no impairment is recognized. If the carrying amount recorded exceeds the fair value calculated, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The judgments made in determining the projected cash flows used to estimate the fair value can materially impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on a quantitative basis for its five reporting units, North America, Europe, Emerging Markets, JANZ, and Greater China. In estimating each reporting unit’s fair value, the Company performed an extensive valuation analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit’s expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions, utilizing Level 3 inputs, primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures forecasts and control premiums.\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually on April 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2024.\nWhen compared to the prior year’s annual goodwill impairment test completed on April 1, 2023, due to certain macroeconomic conditions, the Company has experienced fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain international markets, combined with an increase in market interest rates. These conditions impacted all reporting units, with the most significant impact in JANZ and Emerging Markets. The impact in the other reporting units was offset by changes in other discount rate assumptions.\nAs of April 1, 2024, the allocation of the Company’s total goodwill was as follows: North America $3.12 billion, Europe $3.86 billion, Emerging Markets $1.17 billion, JANZ $0.62 billion and Greater China $0.93 billion.\nIn conjunction with its annual goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $321.0 million during the second quarter of 2024 related to its JANZ reporting unit, which was recorded within\nSG&A\nin the consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was primarily the result of a 1.0% increase in the discount rate and a 0.5% reduction in the terminal growth rate assumption for the reporting unit.\nFor the JANZ reporting unit at April 1, 2024, the Company forecasted cash flows for the next 10 years. During the forecast period, the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately negative 0.3%. A terminal year value was calculated with a 1.0% revenue growth rate applied. The discount rate utilized was 8.0% and the estimated tax rate was 30.3%.\nFollowing the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the JANZ reporting unit, the carrying value of the reporting unit was equal to its estimated fair value as of April 1, 2024. If market conditions or the projected results were to change materially, it may be necessary to record further impairment charges to the JANZ reporting unit in future periods.\n\nevaluation, as of December 31, 2024, our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $255.7 million, of which $182.2 million was recorded in connection with the Combination and is subject to Pfizer’s indemnification obligations to Viatris under the Tax Matters Agreement.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred in certain taxing jurisdictions over the three-year period ended December 31, 2024. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth.\nBased on this evaluation and other factors, as of December 31, 2024, a valuation allowance of $1.23 billion has been recorded in order to measure only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as projections for growth. When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers all available evidence, including historical information, long-term forecasts of future taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. Amounts recorded for valuation allowances can result from a complex series of estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, assumptions and judgments, actual results could differ materially. Any future increases to the Company’s valuation allowances could materially impact the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s net deferred tax assets totaled $753.0 million and $692.9 million, respectively.\nA variance of 5% between estimated reserves and valuation allowances and actual resolution and realization of these tax items would have an effect on our reserve balance and valuation allowance of approximately $74.5 million.\nViatris is involved in various legal proceedings, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. An estimate is made to accrue for a loss contingency relating to any of these legal proceedings if it is probable that a liability was incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because of the subjective nature inherent in assessing the outcome of litigation and because of the potential that an adverse outcome in a legal proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, and/or stock price, such estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates.\nA variance of 5% between estimated and recorded litigation reserves and actual resolution of certain legal matters would have an effect on our litigation reserve balance of approximately $19.2 million. Refer to Note 19\nfor further discussion of litigation matters.\nImpact of Currency Fluctuations and Inflation\nBecause our results are reported in U.S. Dollars, changes in the rate of exchange between the U.S. Dollar and the local currencies in the markets in which we operate, mainly the Euro, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Pound Sterling and South Korean Won affect our results as previously noted. In recent years, the global economy has been impacted by high levels of inflation and rising energy costs, which has resulted in significant economic volatility. As a result, central banks have tightened their monetary policies and increased interest rates. While inflationary and other macroeconomic pressures may ease and interest rates may decline, we do not expect to see a corresponding reduction in these higher costs. These macroeconomic pressures combined with the volatility in foreign exchange rates, including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus certain of the other currencies in which we operate, have impacted and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations. We proactively look to manage such macroeconomic pressures by implementing strategies to mitigate and partially offset the impact of these factors.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nITEM 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition And Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis addresses material changes in the financial condition and results of operations of Viatris Inc. and subsidiaries for the periods presented.
