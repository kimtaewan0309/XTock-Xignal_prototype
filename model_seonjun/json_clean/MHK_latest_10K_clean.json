For variable-rate debt, the Company estimated average outstanding balances for the respective periods and applied interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2024 to these balances.\nIncludes volume commitments, primarily for raw material purchases.\nIncludes the estimated pension contributions for 2025 only, as the Company is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2025. The Company’s projected benefit obligation and plan assets as of December 31, 2024 were $81.4 and $75.5, respectively. The projected benefit obligation liability has not been presented in the table above due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments.\nExcludes $84.9 of non-current accrued income tax liabilities and related interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions. These liabilities have not been presented in the table above due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments.\nIncludes bank guarantees and letters of credit.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, the Company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared.\nThe Company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.\nAcquisition accounting.\nThe fair value of the consideration the Company pays for each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity and goodwill. The accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimate, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. The assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models. Projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for the business. The impact of prior or future acquisitions on the Company’s financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection\nIndex to Financial Statements\nof assumptions and estimates. See Note 2,\nGoodwill and other intangibles.\nThe Company performs its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Between annual testing dates, the Company monitors factors such as its market capitalization, comparable company market multiples and macroeconomic conditions to identify conditions that could impact the Company’s assumptions used in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Company’s reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets significantly enough to trigger an impairment.\nThe goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows under the income approach classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and comparable company market valuation classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy approaches. The Company has identified Global Ceramic, Flooring NA and Flooring ROW as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating and testing for impairment. Indefinite-lived intangibles are recorded and tested for impairment at the asset level. The valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgements and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, WACC and comparable company market multiples.\nAs a result of a decrease in the Company’s market capitalization, macroeconomic conditions and an increase in the WACC, the Company determined that a triggering event occurred requiring goodwill impairment testing for each of its reporting units as of September 30, 2023. The impairment tests indicated pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to all 3 reporting units of $870.8 million ($859.7 million net of tax) which the Company recorded during 2023.\nThe Company compared the estimated fair values of its indefinite-lived intangibles to their carrying values and determined that there were impairment charges of $8.2 million ($6.3 million net of tax) in Global Ceramic Segment during the fourth quarter of 2024 and $7.0 million ($5.2 million net of tax) in all 3 reporting units during the third quarter of 2023.\nA significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions, continued increases in the costs of raw materials and energy combined with an inability to pass these costs on to customers, a further decline in the Company’s market capitalization or comparable company market multiples, projected future cash flows, or increases in the WACC, could impact the Company’s assumptions and require a reassessment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in future periods. Future declines in estimated after tax cash flows, increases in the WACC or a decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment in one or more of the Company’s reporting units.\n. The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating the Company’s tax positions. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely on estimates, including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time. In the event that the Company is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is provided. The Company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. For further information regarding the Company’s valuation allowances, see Note 14,\nIndex to Financial Statements\nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the Company’s income tax positions. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, as required by the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740-10. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information regarding the Company’s uncertain tax positions, see Note 14,\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nInflation affects the Company’s manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating expenses. The Company expects raw material prices, many of which are petroleum-based, to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities used in the Company’s production processes. Although the Company attempts to pass on increases in raw material, labor, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company’s products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered. In the past, the Company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations.\nThe Company is a calendar year-end company. Global Ceramic and Flooring NA typically have higher net sales in the second and third quarters. Flooring ROW typically has higher net sales in the first and second quarters. Because periods of economic downturn can affect the seasonality of each segment, sales for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the sales that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full year.\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\nDuring 2022 and 2023, the Company implemented a number of restructuring actions, productivity initiatives and manufacturing enhancements focused on reducing costs to enhance future performance, including certain facility, asset and product rationalizations and workforce reductions. The Company anticipates that when completed these projects will deliver annual savings of approximately $145 million, with an estimated cost of approximately $215 million. In 2024, the Company announced further restructuring actions, including additional facility, assets and product rationalizations and workforce reductions to further reduce costs and improve the business for the future. The Company anticipates that when completed these projects will deliver annual savings of approximately $140 million, with an estimated cost of approximately $140 million. Execution timelines will vary by project, with some savings extending into 2026.\nThe Company derives a majority of its sales from residential and commercial construction and remodeling. Residential remodeling is the primary sales driver of flooring products and historically most flooring is replaced before a home is listed for sale or just after a home purchase is completed. The combination of high interest rates and inflation has made mortgages less affordable and has increased the cost of home improvement projects, impacting the demand for the Company’s products. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank cut interest rates in 2024, home mortgage rates remain elevated globally, “locking in” current homeowners and suppressing housing turnover rates. Persistent inflation continues to hinder consumer discretionary spending, causing consumers to postpone large purchases of durable goods such as flooring. In addition, declining costs in energy and raw materials, coupled with lower industry volumes, have continued to exert pressure on selling prices, although energy prices in certain geographies and materials prices in some product categories remain volatile and may change significantly and unpredictably.\nThe Company has, to some extent, offset the impact of a soft housing market and decreased renovation activity through cost containment, productivity and lower input costs, including through the restructuring actions discussed above. Due to low housing availability, aging stock and greater household formation, the Company believes demand in its markets will accelerate when interest rates decline.\nDue to its global footprint, Mohawk’s business is sensitive to geopolitical conflict, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. Since the first quarter of 2022, the Company has suspended new investments in Russia in response to ongoing Russian military actions in Ukraine, and the U.S., the European Union and other governments have imposed and broadened sanctions on Russia as well as on certain individuals and financial institutions. In addition, a prolonged and more expansive conflict in the Middle East region could escalate oil and petroleum-based chemical prices as well as lead to the introduction of sanctions or transportation barriers, though the extent of the impact on the Company’s business and results of operations, as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.\n\nThe broader consequences of current ongoing military conflicts, which may include further economic sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; potential retaliatory actions, including nationalization of foreign-owned businesses; increased tensions between the U.S. and countries in which the Company operates; and the extent of the conflict’s effect on the Company’s business and results of operations, as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.\nIncreased restrictions on global trade, including an increase in U.S. tariffs and any countermeasures to these increases, could result in, among other things, increased input costs, volatility in foreign exchange rates and financial markets, supply chain disruptions, and decreased consumer discretionary spending, any of which may adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain.\n\nCompany may be negatively impacted by additional supply chain disruption in the future caused by further escalation of geopolitical conflict and increases in global trade restrictions.\nThe Company believes it is well positioned with a strong balance sheet. Based on its current liquidity and available credit, the Company is in a position to finance internal investments, acquisitions and/or additional stock purchases and pay current debt as it becomes due. For information on risk that could impact the Company’s results, please refer to\nIn 2024, the Company invested approximately $450 million focused on completing capacity expansion projects and targeted initiatives that will drive cost reduction while improving operational performance. In 2025, the Company plans to invest approximately $520 million focused on completing capacity expansion projects and targeted initiatives that will drive cost red",
