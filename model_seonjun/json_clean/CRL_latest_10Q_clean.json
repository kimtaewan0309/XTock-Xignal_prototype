For over 75 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in the research and development of new drugs, devices, and therapies. Over this time, we have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP, that supports our clients from target identification through non-clinical development. We also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities. Utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more efficient and flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness, and increases speed to market.\nOur client base includes major global pharmaceutical companies, many biotechnology companies; agricultural and industrial chemical, life science, veterinary medicine, medical device, diagnostic and consumer product companies; contract research and contract manufacturing organizations; and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions, and government agencies around the world.\nOur three reportable segments are Research Models and Services (RMS), Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA), and Manufacturing Solutions (Manufacturing).\nOur RMS reportable segment includes the products and services offered within Research Models, Research Model Services, and Cell Solutions. Research Models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models, as well as the supply of large research models. Research Model Services includes: Insourcing Solutions (IS), which provides colony management of our clients’ research operations (including recruitment, training, staffing, and management services) within our clients’ facilities as well as our own vivarium space, utilizing our Charles River Accelerator and Development Lab (CRADL™) offerings, Genetically Engineered Models and Services (GEMS), which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered models; and Research Animal Diagnostic Services (RADS), which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models; and Cell Solutions which provides controlled, consistent, customized primary cells and blood components derived from normal and mobilized peripheral blood and bone marrow as well as cells from disease state donors.\nOur DSA segment is comprised of Discovery and Safety Assessment services. We provide regulated and non-regulated DSA services to support the discovery, development, and regulatory-required safety testing of potential new drugs, including\n(in research models) studies, laboratory support services, including bioanalytical and strategic non-clinical consulting and program management to support product development.\nOur Manufacturing reportable segment includes Microbial Solutions, which provides\nlot-release testing products, microbial detection products, and species identification services and Biologics Solutions (Biologics), which performs specialized testing of biologics (Biologics Testing Solutions) as well as contract development and manufacturing products and services (CDMO).\nOur fiscal year is typically based on 52-weeks, with each quarter composed of 13 weeks ending on the last Saturday on, or closest to, March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. A 53rd week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year is occasionally necessary to align with a December 31 calendar year-end.\nGlobal Market Environment\nWe are continuing to see a cautious spending environment from our client base, principally within our DSA segment related to our global biopharmaceutical and biotechnology clients, as they reassess their budgets, reprioritize their drug pipelines, and manage their cost structures. As we continue to navigate these challenges in the current macroeconomic environment, DSA backlog declined slightly to $1.8 billion as of September 27, 2025 from $2.0 billion as of December 28, 2024.\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nIn response to recent trends observed across each of our businesses in the global market environment, we have undertaken and will continue to implement restructuring actions at various locations across North America, Europe and Asia. This includes workforce right-sizing actions, resulting in severance and transition costs; and costs related to the consolidation of facilities to optimize our global footprint and drive greater operating efficiency across the company, resulting in asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, and other site consolidation charges. During fiscal year 2023, we began taking restructuring actions as a result of these emerging business trends. We incurred restructuring charges of $17.3 million and $73.3 million, during the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025, respectively, and $107.0 million and $29.7 million during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. We expect that these effectuated actions, as well as other upcoming planned actions designed to optimize our global footprint to drive greater operating efficiency, will result in approximately $225 million of cost savings on an annualized basis, of which approximately $175 million will impact fiscal year 2025.\nIn November 2025, we announced as part of our Board of Directors’ comprehensive strategic review of our business and growth prospects, that we will focus on strategic initiatives to strengthen our leading scientific portfolio within our core markets through strategic acquisitions, partnerships, and internal investments; divest certain underperforming or non-core assets, which represent approximately 7% of the Company’s estimated 2025 revenue; maximize our financial performance, including by implementing additional initiatives aimed at driving greater operating efficiency, which are expected to generate incremental net cost savings of approximately $70 million annually, which will be fully realized in 2026; and maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment through regularly evaluating the optimal balance between strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt repayment, and other uses of capital.\nRecent Government Actions\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”), which includes changes to a broad range of tax reform provisions including accelerated tax depreciation, expensing of research and development, and the U.S. international inclusions. We have analyzed the impacts of the OBBBA and reflected them in the current period. The enactment of the OBBBA did not have a material impact to the tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2025.\nIn February 2025 the U.S. government announced plans to enact increased tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, later broadening the increase to various countries within Europe, Africa and Asia. As of the date of this report, a number of new tariffs remain in effect, including tariffs between the U.S., and countries from which we obtain significant supply, such as Vietnam, Mauritius and China. The extent and duration of these tariffs and the resulting impact on macroeconomic conditions and our business are uncertain and may depend on various factors including, but not limited to, negotiations between the U.S. and affected countries, reciprocal or retaliatory actions imposed by other countries, tariff exemptions, negative sentiment toward U.S. companies and products, and the availability of lower cost inputs that may be sourced domestically. While we plan to offset most of the estimated tariffs by passing along these higher costs, we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impacts to our business and our operating results.\nIn April 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced plans to launch a pilot program to reduce animal testing in preclinical safety studies with scientifically validated cell-based and new approach methodologies (NAMs), such as organ-on-a-chip systems, computational modeling, and advanced in vitro assays. We support the FDA’s announcement as we believe the program aligns with the vision previously outlined in the FDA Modernization Act 2.0 and aims to develop a clearer regulatory pathway to streamline the drug development process and safely advance innovative technologies, including alternatives to the current animal based development process. As a leader in preclinical drug development, this vision is consistent with our long-standing mission to drive greater efficiency in the drug development process, enhance scientific innovation, and promote the responsible use of animals in biomedical research. We are continuously evaluating innovative approaches in drug development and have invested in virtual control groups for safety assessment studies and partnerships utilizing AI technologies to reduce animal use. Further, in April 2024, we launched our own Alternative Methods Advancement Project (AMAP), which is an initiative dedicated to developing alternatives to the use of animal testing within the drug development process. In October 2025, we announced the creation of a cross-functional Scientific Advisory Board to guide our strategic focus on NAMs. We remain committed to continuing to collaborate with regulatory agencies, including the FDA, the biopharmaceutical industry and other stakeholders, to help develop, validate, and implement an efficient process for our clients’ regulatory submissions that support the use of new, non-animal based technologies.\nU.S. Government Investigations into the Non-Human Primate Supply Chain\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nresolved.
