The increase was primarily due to a 79.1% increase in the volume of modules sold to third parties and the prior period reduction in revenue related to manufacturing issues affecting certain Series 7 modules manufactured in 2023 and 2024.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, we terminated various master supply agreements with a major oil and gas customer due to the customer’s failure to cure several breaches of its contractual obligations. These terminations triggered certain contractual termination payment provisions amounting to $384.6 million, of which we recognized $61.0 million as revenue for the advance payments previously received from the customer. In September 2025, we filed a complaint with the Supreme Court of the State of New York seeking relief and demanding payment from the customer for the remaining termination payments along with certain other receivables for solar modules previously delivered to the customer.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 decreased 11.9 percentage points to 38.3% from 50.2% for the same period in 2024. The decrease was primarily due to higher logistics, detention, and demurrage charges; a lower sales mix of modules qualifying for the advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X of the IRC; and, as a percentage of net sales, lower relative revenue associated with certain customer contract terminations; partially offset by the prior period reduction in revenue related to manufacturing issues affecting certain Series 7 modules manufactured in 2023 and 2024.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, we commenced production of Series 7 modules at our new manufacturing facility in Louisiana, bringing our total installed nameplate production capacity across all our facilities to approximately 23.5 GW. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, we produced 3.6 GW and sold 5.3 GW of solar modules.\nIn July 2025, we entered into an agreement for the sale of up to $391.0 million of Section 45X tax credits we expect to generate during 2025 for aggregate cash proceeds of up to $372.8 million. We received initial cash proceeds of $123.5 million and $124.2 million in July and October 2025, respectively, and we expect to receive the remaining cash proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nSolar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous benefits, including economic benefits and speed of deployment, which make it an attractive complement to or substitute for traditional forms of energy generation. In recent years, the cost of producing electricity from PV solar power systems has decreased to levels that are competitive with or below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets. Other technological developments in the renewable energy industry, such as the advancement of energy storage capabilities, have further enhanced the prospects of solar energy as an alternative to traditional forms of energy generation. As a result of these and other factors, worldwide solar markets continue to develop and expand.\nGovernment incentive programs have contributed to this momentum by providing solar module manufacturers, project developers, and project owners with various incentives to accelerate the deployment of solar power generation. Although we compete in markets that do not require solar-specific government incentive programs, our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of these programs, including tax and production incentives, renewable portfolio standards, and other incentive programs intended to stimulate economies, achieve decarbonization initiatives, and/or establish greater energy independence. Such programs continue to influence the demand for PV solar energy around the world.\nAs a result of the market opportunities described above, we recently commenced operations at our fourth and fifth manufacturing facilities in the United States and completed the expansion of our manufacturing footprint at our existing facilities in Ohio. We believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules, particularly those in China, have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. Accordingly, we believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand, which could lead to periods of pricing volatility. Further, demand for solar energy in key markets, such as the United States and India, may be affected by the nature and extent of commitments to the renewable energy transition at the local and global levels. Notwithstanding these considerations, utility and corporate demand for energy and overall electric load growth, especially as a result of artificial intelligence-driven data center demand, continue to increase. Further, even on an unsubsidized basis, utility-scale PV solar is cost competitive with conventional forms of energy generation, including natural gas and nuclear, and is significantly faster to deploy than a five-year natural gas project development timeline or a much longer nuclear project timeline.\nInternationally, given the combination of (i) a European market captured by Chinese solar modules, where pricing is at levels near or below manufacturing costs, (ii) an Indian market effectively closed to Southeast Asian products, (iii) a general supply and demand imbalance for Southeast Asian products, and (iv) certain tariffs on modules imported into the United States, we have reduced production of Series 6 modules at our international manufacturing facilities.\nIn light of these market realities, we continue to advocate for industrial policies that provide a level playing field for domestic manufacturers of solar cells and modules. We also continue to focus on our strategies and points of differentiation, which include our advanced module technology, our manufacturing process and distributed manufacturing presence, our localized supply chain, our R&D capabilities, our commitment to responsible solar, and our financial stability.\nThe solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. This competition may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, which could potentially increase demand for solar energy solutions but constrain the ability for module manufacturers and project developers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if competitors reduce pricing below their costs, bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time. For certain of our competitors, including many in China, these practices may be enabled by their direct or indirect access to sovereign capital or other forms of state support. Module average selling prices in many global markets have declined. However, recent module pricing in the United States, our primary market, has remained relatively stable due, in part, to the rising demand for domestically manufactured modules as a result of the IRA and tariffs on modules imported into the United States.\nWe face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other emerging technologies. Solar module manufacturers compete with one another on sales price per watt, which may be influenced by several module value attributes, including energy yield, wattage (through a larger form factor or an improved conversion efficiency), degradation, sustainability, and reliability. Sales price per watt may also be influenced by warranty terms, customer payment terms, and/or module attributes. We believe that utility-scale solar will continue to be a compelling offering and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix. However, this focus on utility-scale module offerings exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar, which may influence our future offerings.\nWe continue to devote significant resources to support the implementation of our technology roadmap and improve the energy output of our modules. In the course of our R&D activities, we explore various technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation of our modules. Such technologies include the development of bifacial modules, the implementation of our CuRe program, and the ongoing research and development of a viable and commercially scalable perovskite product.\n. While conventional solar modules are monofacial, meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side, most module manufacturers offer bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module. Bifaciality compromises nameplate efficiency, but by converting both front and rear side irradiance, such technology may improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications, which could lower the overall levelized cost of electricity (“LCOE”) of a system when compared to systems using monofacial solar modules. Our bifacial module features an innovative transparent back contact, which, in addition to converting both front and rear side irradiance, allows infrared light to pass through rather than be absorbed as heat. This design lowers the operational temperature of the module, resulting in a higher energy yield.\n. Our CuRe program is intended to improve our current semiconductor structure by replacing copper with certain other elements that are expected to enhance module performance by improving its bifaciality char"
