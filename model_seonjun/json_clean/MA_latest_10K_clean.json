  "item1_clean": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nMastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry. We connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions secure, simple, smart and accessible. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®. We operate a payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and our customers. Through our unique and proprietary global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions. We have additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). Using these capabilities, we offer consumer and commercial payment products, capture new payment flows and provide services and solutions. These services and solutions include, among others, security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement services, and business and market insights, all of which draw on our principled and responsible use of secure data\nOur capabilities strengthen, reinforce and complement each other and are fundamentally interdependent. For our global payments network, our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which we operate.\nFor a full discussion of our business, please see page 10.\nThe following are our key financial and operational highlights for 2024, including growth rates over the prior year:\nGAAP\n$28.2B\n$12.9B\nAdjusted net revenue\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$28.2B\n$13.5B\n$13.4B\n$11.0B\n$14.8B\n\nWe operate a framework to address disputes between our network participants\nOur Payment Products and Applications\nWe provide a wide variety of products and services that support payment products that customers can offer to consumers and merchants. These offerings facilitate transactions across our payments network and platforms among account holders, merchants, financial institutions, digital partners, businesses, governments and other organizations in markets globally.\nWe offer products that enable issuers to provide consumers with credit, allowing them to defer payment. These programs are designed to meet the needs of our customers around the world and address standard, premium and affluent consumer segments.\nHow We Benefit Consumers\nWe enable our customers to benefit consumers by:\nmaking electronic payments more convenient, secure and efficient\ndelivering better, seamless consumer experiences\nproviding consumers choice, empowering them to make and receive payments in the ways that best meet their daily needs\nprotecting consumers and all other participants in a transaction, as well as consumer data\nproviding loyalty rewards and benefits\nWe support a range of payment products and solutions that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient access to funds in deposit and other accounts. Our debit and deposit access programs can be used to make purchases and to obtain cash from bank branches, at ATMs and, in some cases, at the point of sale. Our branded debit programs consist of Mastercard (including standard, premium and affluent offerings), Maestro (our PIN-based solution that operates globally) and Cirrus (our primary global cash access solution).\nPrepaid accounts are a type of electronic payment that enables consumers to pay from pre-funded accounts whether or not they previously had a bank account or a credit history. These accounts can be tailored to meet specific program, customer or consumer needs, such as paying bills, sending person-to-person payments or withdrawing cash from an ATM. Our focus ranges from digital accounts (such as fintech and gig economy platforms) to business programs such as employee payroll, health savings accounts and solutions for small business owners. Our prepaid programs also offer opportunities in the private and public sectors to drive financial inclusion of previously unbanked individuals through social security payments, unemployment benefits and salary cards.\nConsumer Bill Payments.\nOur solutions enable consumers and small businesses to pay their billers in a seamless and secure way, providing an experience that offers flexibility and benefits consumers, financial institutions and billers. Utilizing our merchant acceptance network (which includes many billers), we offer consumers the choice of paying their bills in a convenient and secure manner using credit, debit or prepaid as well as account-based payments methods.\n\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIntellectual Property\nWe own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business, including Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus, through one or more affiliates. We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and services offered by us to support our payment programs. Trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used and/or properly maintained. Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the use of our trademarks on a royalty-free basis in connection with our customers’ issuing and merchant acquiring businesses. In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, biometrics, AI, security systems, blockchain and other technologies, which are important to our business operations. These patents expire at varying times depending on the jurisdiction and filing date.\nWe face a number of competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry. We compete in all categories of payments (including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments) as well as in all categories in which we provide services and solutions:\nGeneral Purpose Payments Networks.\nWe compete worldwide with payments networks such as Visa, American Express, JCB, China UnionPay and Discover, among others. These competitors tend to offer a range of card-based payment products. Some competitors have more market share than we do in certain jurisdictions. Some also have different business models that may provide an advantage in pricing, regulatory compliance burdens or otherwise. Globally, financial institutions may issue both Mastercard- and Visa-branded payment products, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual portfolios or programs. In addition, a number of our customers issue American Express-, China UnionPay- and/or Discover-branded payment cards in a manner consistent with a four-party system. We continue to face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our issuers and acquirers, and we seek to enter into business agreements with them through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our payment products.\nDebit and Local Networks.\nWe compete with ATM and point-of-sale debit networks. In various countries, local debit brands serve as the main domestic brands, while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions (typically representing a small portion of overall transaction volume). In addition, several governments are promoting, or considering promoting, local networks for domestic switching. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for a more detailed discussion of the risks related to payments system regulation and government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively.\nReal-time Account-based Payments Systems.\nWe face competition in the ACH and real-time account-based payments space from providers of infrastructure, applications and services. As these real-time account-based propositions mature, we face a possible increase in competition for our existing domestic person-to-merchant (“P2M”) and person-to-person (“P2P”) transaction market share. Similarly, as interlinking of these infrastructures is further explored, they could disrupt our existing cross-border P2M and P2P market share. Also, several industry initiatives are experimenting with the concept of account-based global schemes, which could lead to a disruption of the clearing and settlement options utilized in various currencies.\nDigital Wallets and other Fintechs.\nAs the global payments industry becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from fintechs and other emerging payments providers, both for customers and data. Many of these providers have developed payments systems focused on online activity in e-commerce and mobile channels (in some cases, expanding to other channels), and may process payments using in-house account transfers, real-time account-based payments networks or global or local networks, in addition to card. Examples include digital wallet providers, point-of-sale financing/buy-now-pay-later providers, mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinancing services, device manufacturers, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable providers.\nDigital Public Infrastructure and Other Government-Backed Solutions.\nGovernments have been focused on creating and expanding local digital payments structures. Increasingly, these structures include digital public infrastructure (DPI), which is owned by governments and often supported by third parties, and aim to provide payments services as a public good. Government- and central bank-backed structures (such as the Brazilian Instant Payment System-PIX, FedNow in the U.S. and United Payments Interface (UPI) in India), are increasingly being considered as alternatives to traditional domestic payment solutions and schemes such as ours. In addition to local and regional networks, national governments continue to explore the use of central bank digital currencies (“CBDCs”), which may be launched with their own networks to transfer money between participants.\nStablecoins and floating cryptocurrencies may become more popular as they become more regulated and increasingly viewed as providing immediacy, 24/7 accessibility, immutability and efficiency. Some players, including payment\n\nOur payments network helps us scale our services and solutions, and those services and solutions help us differentiate our payments solutions\nWe grow in payments, which allows us to switch more transactions and bring more transaction data onto the network\nWe use that data to create insightful services and solutions that can, in turn, help us win new and renewed customer deals and drive greater payments volume growth\nEnabling Our Success\nThese priorities are supported by six enablers:\nOur success is driven by the skills, experience, integrity and mindset of our people.

Current year results include an increase of 2 percentage points from a restructuring charge of $190 million and 1 percentage point from acquisitions. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel and data processing costs to support the continued investment in our strategic initiatives across payments and value-added services and solutions, as well as fulfillment costs to provide marketing services.\n\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables represent the reconciliation of our growth rates reported under GAAP to our non-GAAP growth rates:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nEffective income tax rate\nDiluted earnings per share\n(Gains) losses on equity investments\nLitigation provisions\nRestructuring charge\nAdjusted - Non-GAAP - currency-neutral\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nEffective income tax rate\nDiluted earnings per share\n(Gains) losses on equity investments\nLitigation provisions\nRussia-related impacts\nAdjusted - Non-GAAP - currency-neutral\nNote: Tables may not sum due to rounding.\nKey Metrics and Drivers\nIn addition to the financial measures described above in “Financial Results Overview”, we review the following metrics to evaluate and identify trends in our business, measure our performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe that the key metrics presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\nmeasures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income (expense) and income tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\nGross Dollar Volume (“GDV”)\nmeasures dollar volume of activity, including both domestic and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. Information denominated in U.S. dollars relating to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. We report period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.\nCross-border Volume Growth\nmeasures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.\n\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nNon-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). As described more fully below, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition, as well as the related tax impacts. Our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts (“Special Items”). We also present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. We excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items. Net revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, Special Items and/or the impact of currency should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:\nGains and Losses on Equity Investments\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net pre-tax losses of $29 million ($25 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted share), $61 million ($36 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) and $145 million ($126 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share), respectively. These net losses were primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities.\nLitigation provisions\nDuring 2024, we recorded pre-tax charges of $680 million ($495 million after tax, or $0.53 per diluted share), primarily as a result of a legal provision associated with the U.K. consumer class action settlement, settlements with a number of U.K. merchants and a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.\nDuring 2023, we recorded pre-tax charges of $539 million ($376 million after tax, or $0.40 per diluted share), primarily as a result of changes in the estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation and settlements with a number of U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\nDuring 2022, we recorded pre-tax charges of $356 million ($263 million after tax, or $0.27 per diluted share), primarily as a result of settlements (both final and agreements in principle) with a number of U.K. merchants and a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.\nRestructuring charge\n\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCurrency-neutral Growth Rates\nCurrency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results and are non-GAAP financial measures. The impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different from our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. The impact of the related realized gains and losses resulting from our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments (specifically those that manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses) is recognized in the respective financial statement line item on the statements of operations when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings.\nThe translational and transactional impact of currency and the related impact of our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments as specified in the preceding paragraph (collectively the “Currency Impact”) has been excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates and has been identified in the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” tables below and our “Drivers of Change” tables. See “Foreign Currency - Currency Impact” for further information on our currency impacts and “Financial Results - Net Revenue” and “Financial Results - Operating Expenses” for our “Drivers of Change” tables.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nThe following tables reconcile our reported financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to the respective adjusted non-GAAP financial measures:\nYear ended December 31, 2024\n\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides a summary of our key metrics related to the payment network.\nYears ended December 31,\nDomestic assessments\nCross-border assessments\nTransaction processing assessments\nOther network assessments\nOur primary functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound and the Brazilian real. Our overall operating results are impacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.\nOur operating results are also impacted by transactional currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. Changes in currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“GDV”), which is used in the calculation of our key metrics related to domestic assessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and incentives. GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars and euros using average exchange rates for the period. As a result, our key metrics related to domestic assessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar and euro versus local currencies. For example, our billing in Australia is in the U.S. dollar, however, consumer spend in Australia is in the Australian dollar. The transactional currency impact of converting Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis. In 2024, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 8.1%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 10.5% versus 2023. In 2023, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 10.6%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 12.2% versus 2022. Further, the impact from transactional currency occurs in our key metrics related to transaction processing assessments and other network assessments as well as value-added services and solutions revenue and operating expenses when the transacting currency of these items is different than the functional currency of the entity.\nTo manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts and designate such derivatives as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship as discussed further in Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nForeign Exchange Activity\nWe incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities, including settlement assets and obligations, that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. To manage this foreign exchange risk, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of our nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities. The gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of these contracts are intended to reduce the potential effect of the underlying hedged exposure and are recorded net within general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The impact of this foreign exchange activity, including with the related hedging activities, has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results.\nOur foreign exchange risk management activities are discussed further in Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\n\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes.\nIn calculating our effective income tax rate, estimates are required regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. Through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in",
