Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nForward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our outlook, guidance, expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions and strategies. Words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"plan,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"if,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"project\" and similar words or expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to us at the time the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nWe are a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty aftermarket products and accessories to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles.\nBuyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by OEMs; new products produced by companies other than the OEMs, which are referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage and total loss vehicles; recycled products that have been refurbished; and recycled products that have been remanufactured. We distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products; recycled collision and mechanical products; refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights; and remanufactured engines and transmissions. Collectively, we refer to the four sources that are not new OEM products as alternative parts.\nOur Wholesale - North America segment is a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products, paint and body repair related products, and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the United States and Canada. Our Europe segment is a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in Germany, the U.K., the Benelux region (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg), Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, France and various other European countries. Our Specialty segment is a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the U.S. and Canada.\nOur operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Please refer to the factors referred to in Forward-Looking Statements above. Due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to us at this time, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate\nAccordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nSince our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. Our current acquisition strategy focuses on highly accretive tuck-in acquisitions with significant synergies or critical capabilities and no large platform acquisitions are expected. Additionally, from time to time, we make investments in various businesses to advance our strategic objectives.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Information by Geographic Area\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe believe that organic revenue growth, Segment EBITDA and free cash flow are key performance indicators for our business. Segment EBITDA is our key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our CODM. Free cash flow is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”).\nOrganic revenue growth\n- We define organic revenue growth as total revenue growth from continuing operations excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures (i.e., revenue generated from the date of acquisition to the first anniversary of that acquisition, net of reduced revenue due to the disposal of businesses) and foreign currency movements (i.e., impact of translating revenue at different exchange rates). Organic revenue growth includes incremental sales from both existing and new (i.e., opened within the last twelve months) locations and is derived from expanding business with existing customers, securing new customers and offering additional products and services. We believe that organic revenue growth is a key performance indicator as this statistic measures our ability to serve and grow our customer base successfully.\n- We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow provides insight into our liquidity and provides useful information to management and investors concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase stock, and pay dividends.\nThese three key performance indicators are used as targets in determining incentive compensation at various levels of the organization, including senior management. By using these performance measures, we attempt to motivate a balanced approach to the business that rewards growth, profitability and cash flow generation in a manner that enhances our long-term prospects.\nResults of Operations—Consolidated\nThe following table sets forth statements of income data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n\nof 0.4% from Wholesale - North America and 0.3% from Europe, partially offset by a decrease of 0.2% from Specialty. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in SG&A expenses by segment for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nRestructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\nRestructuring and transaction related expenses decreased by $6 million, primarily due to an $8 million decrease in restructuring expenses related to our 2024 Global Restructuring plan, partially offset by a $4 million increase in transaction related expenses for legal, accounting and advisory services related to completed and potential transactions.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was 20.0%, compared to 25.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to the discrete tax benefits, including a $10 million reduction to deferred tax liabilities related to tax rate changes enacted in Germany during the third quarter of 2025.\nForeign Currency Impact\nWe translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. Relative to the rates used during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Czech koruna, euro and pound sterling rates used to translate the three months ended September 30, 2025 statements of income increased by 9.4%, 6.4% and 3.7%, respectively, while the Canadian dollar rate decreased by 0.9%. Realized and unrealized currency gains and losses combined with the translation effect of the change in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar had a net positive effect of $0.02 on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations relative to the prior year period.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nThe following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category (in millions):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nParts & services revenue\nThe decrease in parts and services revenue of $268 million, or 2.6%, represented decreases in segment revenue of $148 million, or\n\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 27.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from 27.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects increases of 0.4% from Europe and 0.3% from Wholesale - North America. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in SG&A expenses by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRestructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\nRestructuring and transaction related expenses decreased by $66 million, primarily due to a $48 million decrease in restructuring expenses related to our 2024 Global Restructuring plan and a $16 million decrease in restructuring expenses related to our Acquisition Integration plans.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was 24.8%, compared to 29.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to the discrete tax benefits, including a $10 million reduction to deferred tax liabilities related to tax rate changes enacted in Germany during the third quarter of 2025 and the nonrecurring unfavorable tax effects of the Global Restructuring Plan impairments in the prior year. See Note 6, \"Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\" for further information on the impairments.\nForeign Currency Impact\nWe translate our statements of inc"
