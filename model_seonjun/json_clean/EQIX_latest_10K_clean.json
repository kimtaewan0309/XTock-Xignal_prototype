  "item1_clean": "Overview: Enabling Innovation for the Digital World\nEquinix (Nasdaq: EQIX) is the world's digital infrastructure company\n. Digital leaders harness our trusted platform to bring together and interconnect the foundational infrastructure that powers their success. Equinix enables organizations to access all the right places, partners and possibilities they need to accelerate their advantage. Platform Equinix combines a global footprint of International Business Exchange\nTM\n(IBX\ndata centers in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") regions, infrastructure and interconnection offerings, unique business and digital ecosystems and expert consulting and support.\nEquinix was incorporated on June 22, 1998 as a Delaware corporation and operates as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Al Avery and Jay Adelson founded Equinix as a network-neutral, multi-tenant data center (\"MTDC\") provider, where competing networks could connect and share data traffic to help scale the rapid growth of the early internet. The company’s name, Equinix (composed from the words \"equality,\" \"neutrality\" and \"internet exchange\"), reflects that vision. The founders believed they not only had the opportunity, but also the responsibility to create a company that would be the steward of some of the most important digital infrastructure assets in the world. Over two and a half decades later, we have expanded upon that vision to build Platform Equinix\n, which we believe is unmatched in scale and reach.\nOur data centers around the world allow our customers to bring together and interconnect the infrastructure they need to fast-track their digital advantage. With Equinix, they can scale with agility, accelerate the launch of digital offerings, deliver world-class experiences and multiply their value. We enable them to differentiate by distributing infrastructure and removing the distance between clouds, users and applications in order to reduce latency and deliver a superior customer, partner and employee experience. The Equinix global platform, and the quality of our offerings, have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix for bandwidth cost and performance reasons, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers and connect directly with each other. This adjacency creates a network effect that attracts new customers, continuously enhances our existing customers' value and enables them to capture further economic and performance benefits from our offerings.\nIn 2024, we opened 16 new data centers, inclusive of new xScale sites via our joint ventures. Our new data center openings included sites in the following metros: Barcelona, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Mumbai, New York, Osaka, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, Silicon Valley, Tokyo and Warsaw. When including an additional data center which opened in February 2025, this results in an increase in our total number of data center facilities to 268. Additional 2024 highlights include:\nIn April, we sold the Silicon Valley 12 (“SV12”) data center site in connection with the formation of a new joint venture (\"JV\") to develop and operate the first xScale data center in the U.S. The facility will be built out in two phases and is expected to provide more than 28 MW of power capacity when completed.\nIn July, we announced our entry into the Philippines with the planned acquisition of three data centers in Manila for a stated purchase price of $180 million, subject to certain adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to add more than 1,000 cabinets of capacity. This follows our recent expansions into Indonesia and Malaysia, enabling us to help businesses expand and capitalize on the digital opportunity of the fast-growing Southeast Asia region.\nIn October, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture to develop and operate data centers in the Americas region, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions which were satisfied on October 30, 2024. With the $15.0 billion of capital expected to be raised through this joint venture, we expect to accelerate xScale deployment in the U.S., eventually adding more than 1.5 gigawatts of new capacity for hyperscale customers.\nIn November, we announced plans to build our sixth data center in Singapore. This new high performance data center will feature a design built to efficiently compute intensive workloads like artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), supported by capabilities such as advanced liquid cooling. Expected to open in Q1 2027, the 9-story facility was awarded as part of Singapore's pilot Data Centre - Call for Application and will provide 20MW of power capacity when fully built.\nIndustry Trends: The rise of intelligent ecosystems\nThe digital economy is advancing rapidly, driven by exponential data growth, ecosystem collaboration and edge-to-cloud innovations. Interconnected networks are transforming business operations and enabling organizations to scale, innovate and thrive. Emerging trends shaping this landscape include:\nIndustries are becoming smarter, faster and more adaptable as AI enhances decision-making and automates tasks. Businesses are shifting from traditional, siloed models to interconnected ecosystems, where collaboration and seamless integration of services drive value at scale. Digital-first strategies are empowering businesses to transition from static product offerings to dynamic, outcome-based services, harnessing real-time data and ecosystem interconnections as competitive advantages.\nThe interconnection imperative:\nThis digital shift is fostering collaboration and data sharing, forming tightly connected networks of businesses and partners. These networks are reshaping supply and value chains into intelligent, service-based systems, with rapidly growing data and participant ecosystems driving efficiency and innovation. Interconnection is becoming the backbone of the digital economy, enabling real-time collaboration, operational scale and faster decision-making. Businesses investing in high-speed, low-latency connections are leading in adapting to these complex, data-driven demands.\nEcosystem scalability:\nOrganizations are leveraging interconnected ecosystems to expand market reach, streamline service delivery and unlock new revenue streams. Revenue is increasingly tied to participation in electronic ecosystems rather than standalone transactions. The emergence of dynamic producer-consumer relationships, where businesses act as service providers, consumers and intermediaries is gaining traction. This adaptability enables businesses to meet evolving market demands while optimizing resource allocation and driving growth.\nEdge-to-cloud transformation:\nBuilt upon the foundation of connectivity, edge-to-cloud workflows are enabling businesses to move data and compute closer to where value is created. This layered strategy supports efficient data flows, reduces latency, and optimizes costs. By introducing an authoritative data core distributed across areas of digital density—with low latency access to multiple clouds and SaaS platforms—businesses can achieve scalability and compliance. This approach, paired with a data edge for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (\"RAG\") inference models, enables efficient AI and real-time applications in proximity to customers, business operations and endpoints of value delivery and revenue generation.\nSustainability by design:\nSustainability is a key priority for global organizations, as market expectations and regulations demand greener practices. Interconnection and efficient digital infrastructures are critical in supporting net-zero goals. By adopting innovative, energy-efficient technologies, businesses are not only reducing carbon footprints, but also building long-term resilience and value.\nInterconnection remains the foundation of the digital economy, facilitating seamless data exchange and collaboration. Our research estimates that private interconnection capacity will grow at a compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") of 29% by 2027, potentially nearing 40,000 terabits per second of data exchanged annually. The growth reflects the increasing demand for scalable, high-performance networks to support AI, edge computing and distributed ecosystem business models.\nWorldwide Interconnection Bandwidth Capacity CAGR (2023-2027) in Terabits per Second (Tbps)\nEquinix Business Proposition: To Be the Platform Where the World Comes Together\nIn 2024, we continued to build new offerings to further our mission to make digital infrastructure more powerful, accessible and sustainable. On Platform Equinix, businesses can reach the most strategic markets with scalable, navigable infrastructure that blends physical and virtual options on our one-of-a-kind global ecosystem. We enable competitive advantage for our customers and partners by creating the foundational infrastructure capabilities that harness innovation and create value. We offer a comprehensive, integrated suite of infrastructure and interconnection solutions and products to over 10,000 enterprise and service provider customers worldwide.\nOur global, state-of-the-art data centers meet strict standards of security, reliability, certification and sustainability. Our footprint consists of 268 data centers worldwide:\nIBX\n\nprovides direct, dedicated, carrier-grade network links between customers in one IBX and partners in another IBX within the same metro. Metro Connect provides integration with customers, partners and service providers within the Equinix digital ecosystem, supplying highly reliable, extremely low-latency communication, system integration and data exchange.\nEquinix Network Edge\nallows customers to modernize networks within minutes, by deploying network functions virtualization (\"NFV\") from multiple vendors across Equinix metros. Companies can select, deploy and connect virtual network solutions at the edge quickly, with no additional hardware requirements.\nWhile a large number of enterprises and service providers, such as hyperscale cloud service providers, own their own data centers, we believe the industry is shifting away from single-tenant solutions to customers outsourcing some or all of their IT housing and interconnection requirements to third-party facilities, such as those operated by Equinix. This shift is being accelerated by the increasing adoption of hybrid multi-cloud architectures and the adoption of AI.\nHistorically, the outsourcing market was served by large telecommunications carriers that bundled their products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and carrier-neutral multi-tenant data centers, public and private cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, large hyperscale cloud providers and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,400 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. The global MTDC market is highly fragmented. Each of these data center solution providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, outsourced IT infrastructure solutions and managed services. We believe that this outsourcing trend has accelerated and is likely to continue to accelerate in the coming years, especially in light of the movement to digital business, the use of multiple cloud service providers and the adoption of AI.\nEquinix is differentiated in this market by offering customers a global platform that reaches over 30 countries and contains the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, including access to a leading share of cloud on-ramps and an increasingly diverse ecosystem of networks and cloud and IT service providers. This ecosystem creates a network eff",
  "item7_clean": "within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Contractual Obligations\nWe have additional future equity contributions and loan commitments to our joint ventures. For additional information, see the \"Equity Method Investments\" in Note 5 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdditionally, we entered into lease agreements with various landlords primarily for data center spaces and ground leases which have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2024. For additional information, see “Maturities of Lease Liabilities” in Note 9 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\n• Accounting for income taxes;\n• Accounting for business combinations;\n• Accounting for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;\n• Accounting for property, plant and equipment; and\n• Accounting for leases.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAccounting for Income Taxes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as tax attributes such as net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled, and the tax attributes to be utilized.\nThe accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.\nA tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax benefit (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future tax consequences.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realizable, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.\nThis assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income, 3) taxable income in carryback years permitted by the tax law, and 4) tax planning strategies.\nIn assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.\nFor purposes of the quarterly REIT asset tests, we estimate the fair market value of assets within our QRSs and TRSs using a discounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. We apply discount rates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other significant assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth, projected operating margins and projected capital expenditure.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had net total deferred tax liabilities of $291 million and $332 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had a total valuation allowance of $277 million and $221 million, respectively. If and when we increase or reduce our valuation allowances, it may have an unfavorable or favorable impact, respectively, to our financial position and results of operations in the periods when such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by jurisdiction, in the future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we established full valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the AMER region as part of our assessment of the realization of such deferred tax assets. We do not expect these deferred tax assets to be realizable in the foreseeable future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we established full valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the EMEA region as part of the purchase accounting determination for the assets we acquired during the year. We do not expect these deferred tax assets to be realizable in the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $57 million and $70 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the unrecognized tax benefit decreased by $13 million and $19 million, respectively, primarily due to the settlements of tax audits and lapse of statute of limitations in the EMEA region. The unrecognized tax benefits of $57 million as of December 31, 2024, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such a benefit is recognized.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nIn accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill.\nWe use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.\nOur purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and judgments to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Key judgments used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets include projected revenue growth and operating margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies.\nDuring the last three years, we have completed a number of business combinations, including the acquisition of Entel Peru data centers in the third quarter of 2022 and MainOne in West Africa and Entel Chile data centers in the second quarter of 2022. The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions were finalized during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in future periods.\nAccounting for Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nWe complete an annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units to determine if the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values.\nWe do not have any significant indefinite-lived intangible assets for which an impairment assessment would have a material impact on our financial statements.\nFinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at the asset group level along with property, plant and equipment as discussed below.\nTo perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we elected to bypass the optional analysis of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test using a discounted cash flow method as an income approach, and a market approach. Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit and requires significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, forecasted operating results, risk-adjusted discount rates, the determination of appropriate market comparables, future economic conditions and other market data. We periodically review our assessment of our reporting units to determine if changes in facts and circumstances warrant changes to our conclusions. There were no specific factors present in 2024 or 2023 that indicated a potential goodwill impairment.\nAs of December 31, 2024, goodwill attributable to the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units was $2.6 billion, $2.3 billion and $596 million, respectively.\nFuture events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs could result in an impairment charge in future periods.\nThe balance of our other intangible assets, net, for years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. We recorded $29 million impairment charges on finite-lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nAccounting for Property, Plant and Equipment\nWe have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties).\nAccounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period over which to depreciate such assets and assessing such assets for potential impairment. We assess our property, plant and equipment for potential impairment together with finite lived-intangible assets and lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets at the asset group level.\nJudgments are required in arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset and changes to these estimates could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible.\nWe review our asset groups on an ongoing basis to identify any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset group is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset group or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition. This assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. If a potential impairment trigger is identified, the measurement of an impairment loss requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows, and assumptions about the market price of assets. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had property, plant and equipment of $19.2 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded depreciation expense of $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively. We evaluated the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment, and made certain revisions to these estimates during the year ended December 31, 2024. We did not revise these estimates during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We recorded $166 million impairment charges on property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAccounting for Leases\nA significant portion of our data center spaces, office spaces and equipm",
