We evaluate opportunities to acquire complementary businesses, technologies, services, and intellectual property to complement our organic innovation and research and development efforts, advance the development of our platforms, and enable further investment in our key priority areas. Our evaluation of acquisition opportunities seeks to confirm that any potential transaction would accelerate our strategy, represent an attractive customer opportunity, address a customer need, align with our customer base and go-to-market strategy, and present a clear timeline and path for value accretion. Our acquisitions enable us to gain access to talent, technology, products and features, and can range in size and complexity, from those that enhance or complement existing products and accelerate development of features to those that result in new offerings.\nFor example, in August 2024, we completed the acquisition of certain QRadar assets from International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), which we expect will help accelerate the growth of our Cortex business. Additionally, in July 2025, we completed the acquisition of Protect AI, Inc., a privately-held cyber security company (“Protect AI”), which we expect will enhance the capabilities of our AI security platform. In July 2025, we also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CyberArk Software Ltd. (“CyberArk”), an identity security company, which acquisition is expected to close during the second half of our fiscal 2026.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business, and that our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish, protect and control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights. We continue to grow our global portfolio of intellectual property rights in connection with our products, services, research and development. We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products. We have registered various trademarks for our company and our products in the United States (“U.S.”) and other jurisdictions internationally. We intend to continue pursuing additional protections for our proprietary technology and intellectual property to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nCOMPETITION\nWe operate in the intensely competitive enterprise security industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in the application, threat, and technology landscape result in evolving customer requirements for the protection from threats and the safe enablement of applications. Our main competitors fall into four categories:\nlarge companies that incorporate security features in their products, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”), Microsoft, Alphabet, or those that have acquired, or may acquire, security vendors and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market;\nindependent security vendors, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (“Check Point”), Fortinet, Inc. (“Fortinet”), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (“CrowdStrike”), Zscaler, Inc. (“Zscaler”), and Wiz, Inc. (“Wiz”), that offer a mix of security products;\nstartups and point-product vendors that offer independent or emerging solutions across various areas of security; and\npublic cloud vendors and startups that offer solutions for cloud security (private, public, and hybrid cloud).\nAs our market grows, it will attract more highly specialized vendors, as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively.\nThe principal competitive factors in our market include:\nproduct features, reliability, performance, and effectiveness;\nproduct line breadth, diversity, and applicability;\nproduct extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;\nprice and total cost of ownership;\nadherence to industry standards and certifications;\nstrength of sales and marketing efforts; and\nbrand awareness and reputation.\nWe believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of the features and performance of our\n, the ease of integration of our security solutions with technological infrastructures, and the relatively low total cost of ownership of our products. However, some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution, more diversified product lines, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.\nSALES, MARKETING, SERVICES, AND SUPPORT\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. is a global cybersecurity provider and our vision is a world where each day is safer and more secure than the one before.

Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our portfolio, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues and new revenues as we continue to grow our end-customer base. As of July 31, 2025, we had end-customers in over 180 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries, including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include almost all of the Fortune 100 companies and a majority of the Global 2000 companies. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We primarily use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers.\nOur product revenue grew to $1.8 billion or 19.5% of total revenue for fiscal 2025, representing year-over-year growth of 12.4%. Product revenue is derived from sales of hardware products, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall, and software licenses, including SD-WAN, the VM-Series, and Panorama\n. Our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire network security product line. Our hardware products and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-400, which is designed for small organizations and remote or branch offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7500, which is designed for large-scale data centers and service provider use. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our hardware products is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments, and in our CN-Series container firewalls, which secure container environments and traffic.\nOur subscription and support revenue grew to $7.4 billion or 80.5% of total revenue for fiscal 2025, representing year-over-year growth of 15.5%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with near real-time access to the latest intrusion prevention, web security, modern malware prevention, data loss prevention, CASB and AI security capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud.

In addition to the subscriptions purchased with these firewalls, customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis. We also offer professional services, including incident response, risk management, and digital forensic services.\nWe continue to invest in innovation as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products are essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. During fiscal 2025, we introduced several new offerings, including: Prisma Access Browser, new capabilities in our OT Security solution, Cortex Cloud, Prisma AIRS, and Cortex XSIAM 3.0. Additionally, in August 2024, we completed the acquisition of certain IBM QRadar assets, which we expect will help accelerate the growth of our Cortex business. Additionally, in July 2025, we completed the acquisition of Protect AI, which we expect will enhance the capabilities of our AI security platform. In July 2025, we also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Software Ltd. (“CyberArk”), an identity security company, which acquisition is expected to close during the second half of our fiscal 2026.\nIMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS ON OUR BUSINESS\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impact on customer behavior. Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in enforcement and administration policies, may have an impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant changes in U.S. or global trade policy, including further expansion of U.S. export/imports controls and tariffs, as well as retaliatory actions by other countries, may materially and adversely affect our business. Further, economic conditions, including inflation, high interest rates, slow growth, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, supply chain disruptions, impacts of trade regulations or international trade disputes, and other conditions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nThe hostilities in Israel and the surrounding region have continued to result in economic and political uncertainty. While we have business operations in Israel, and intend to continue growing our presence in Israel, we currently do not expect significant business disruption. We are actively monitoring, evaluating, and responding to the situation.\nWe are also monitoring the impact of inflationary pressures and the tensions between China and Taiwan, and between the U.S. and China, which could have an adverse impact on our business or results of operations in future periods.\nKey Financial Metrics\nWe monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating income and margin below under “Results of Operations.”\nNext-Generation Security Annualized Recurring Revenue\nRemaining performance obligations\n(dollars in millions)\nTotal revenue year-over-year percentage increase\nCash flow provided by operating activities\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)\nNext-Generation Security Annualized Recurring Revenue (“NGS ARR”).\nOur NGS ARR represents the annualized allocated revenue of all active contracts as of the final day of the reporting period related to all product, subscription and support offerings, excluding revenue from hardware products, and legacy attached subscriptions, support offerings and professional services. NGS ARR is an operating metric that we use to assess the strength and trajectory of our business. NGS ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations and does not represent our revenue under U.S. GAAP on an annualized basis, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. NGS ARR is not intended to be a replacement for forecasts of revenue. The scope of products, subscriptions, and support offerings that contribute to NGS ARR will generally increase over time as we introduce or acquire new next-generation products, subscriptions, and support offerings.\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities.\nWe monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as share-based compensation costs, depreciation, and amortization, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP).\nWe define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce",
