We offer a broad selection of merchandise, including consumable products such as food, paper and cleaning products, health and beauty products and pet supplies, and non-consumable products such as seasonal merchandise, home decor and domestics, and basic apparel. Our merchandise includes national brands from leading manufacturers, as well as our own private brand selections with prices often at substantial discounts to national brands. We offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices (typically $10 or less) in our convenient small-box locations.\nWe believe our convenient store formats, locations, and broad selection of high-quality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years and through a variety of economic cycles. We are mindful that the majority of our customers are value-conscious, and many have low and/or fixed incomes. As a result, we are intensely focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending dollars. The primary macroeconomic factors that affect our core customers include unemployment and underemployment rates, inflation, wage growth, changes in federal and state tax policies, interest rates, changes in U.S. and global trade policy (including price increases resulting from tariffs), and changes in U.S. government policy and assistance programs (including cost of living adjustments), such as SNAP, unemployment benefits, and economic stimulus programs. In May 2025, the federal government reinstated collections on defaulted student loans, and the impact on our customers and consequently on our business is uncertain at this time, and we can make no assurance that it will not be material. Finally, significant unseasonable or unusual weather patterns or extreme weather can impact customer shopping behaviors.\nUncertainty remains regarding the potential impact of tariffs on consumer behavior and our business. Tariff rates on both direct imports and domestic purchases did not materially impact our financial results for the first two quarters of 2025. Currently announced tariff rates, including those that have been announced but delayed, as well as any increases or expansions of tariff coverage affecting the products that we sell, could have a more significant impact on our business and on our customers’ budgets. However, the tariff environment remains dynamic, and the specific tariffs applicable to goods imported by us and our suppliers into the U.S. may continue to evolve. We continue to monitor developments and to evaluate and implement mitigation strategies to address the potential sales and margin impact of current and potential future tariffs, as well as to take various actions designed to minimize price increases for our customers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in our efforts, or that price increases will not adversely affect customer behavior.\nOur core customers are often among the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and among the last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions, particularly when trends are inconsistent and of an uncertain duration. Our customers continue to feel constrained in the current macroeconomic environment and to experience elevated expenses that generally comprise a large portion of their household budgets, such as rent, healthcare, energy and fuel prices, as well as cost inflation in frequently purchased household products (including food), which we expect will continue to pressure our customers’ spending overall and particularly in our non-consumables categories. We expect a promotional environment in 2025 similar to that in 2024.\nWe remain committed to our long-term operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customer-centric focus. These priorities include: 1) driving profitable sales growth, 2) capturing growth opportunities, 3) enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and 4) investing in the growth and development of our teams.\n\nWe seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives aimed at increasing customer traffic and average transaction amount. Historically, sales in our consumables category, which tend to have lower gross margins, have been the key drivers of net sales and customer traffic, while sales in our non-consumables categories, which tend to have higher gross margins, have been the key drivers of more profitable sales growth and average transaction amount. Our sales mix remains heavily weighted towards consumables, although we saw slight improvement to our sales mix in the second quarter as compared to last year’s second quarter. Certain of our initiatives are intended to better optimize our sales mix; however, there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful.\nAs we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers’ affordability needs, we remain focused on enhancing our margins through inventory shrink and damage reduction initiatives, as well as pricing and markdown optimization, effective category management and inventory reduction efforts, distribution and transportation efficiencies, private brands penetration and global sourcing strategies. Several of our strategic and other sales-driving initiatives are also designed to capture growth opportunities and are discussed in more detail below.\nWe continue to experience significant levels of inventory shrink and damages. However, we have made progress in reducing shrink for four consecutive quarters, and we began to see improvement in damages during the first two quarters of 2025. We continue to take actions designed to address shrink and damage levels.\nWe continue to implement and invest in certain strategic initiatives that we believe will help drive profitable sales growth with both new and existing customers and capture long-term growth opportunities. Such opportunities include providing our customers with a variety of shopping access points and even greater value and convenience by leveraging and developing digital tools and technology, such as our Dollar General app, which contains a variety of tools to enhance the shopping experience. We remain focused on enhancing both the in-store and digital shopping experience, while driving operational efficiency. Partnerships with third-party delivery services are available in the majority of our stores, providing added convenience and incremental sales. Additionally, in September 2024, we partnered with a third-party provider to fully execute a same-day home delivery offering through our DG app and website in select stores. We plan to significantly expand this offering to additional stores throughout 2025. Furthermore, we believe these efforts will contribute to the continued growth of our DG Media Network, our platform that connects brand partners with our customers.\nWe are expanding our efforts to improve the performance and profitability of our mature stores through the rollout of an incremental remodel program, Project Elevate. This partial-remodel initiative is designed to refresh and optimize the merchandising in our stores, and in turn, enhance the shopping experience for our customers, while also mitigating future repairs and maintenance expense. Project Elevate remodels are incremental to our full-remodel program, Project Renovate.\nWe also remain focused on capturing growth opportunities. In the second quarter of 2025, we opened a total of 204 new stores, remodeled 729 stores through Project Elevate and 592 stores through Project Renovate, relocated 15 stores and closed 40 stores. In 2025, we plan to open approximately 575 new stores (as well as up to 15 stores in Mexico), fully remodel approximately 2,000 stores through Project Renovate, partially remodel 2,250 stores through Project Elevate, and relocate approximately 45 stores, for a total of 4,885 real estate projects.\npOpshelf is a unique retail concept focused on categories such as seasonal and home décor, health and beauty, home cleaning supplies, and party and entertainment goods. In light of the softer discretionary sales environment, we previously converted certain pOpshelf stores to Dollar General stores, and do not believe opening new pOpshelf stores in 2025 is a prudent use of capital. At the end of the second quarter of 2025, we operated 180 standalone pOpshelf stores. We are taking focused actions in 2025 designed to improve the performance of pOpshelf stores, although there can be no assurances that our efforts will be successful.\nWe expect store format innovation to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities as we continue to utilize the most productive of our various Dollar General store formats based on the specific market opportunity. In 2025 we expect the significant majority of the stores to be in one of our 8,500 square foot formats. These formats allow for expanded high-capacity-cooler counts, an extended queue line, and a broader product assortment, including an enhanced non-consumable offering, a larger health and beauty section, and produce in select stores.\n\nWe are always seeking ways to reduce or control costs that do not affect our customers’ shopping experiences. We plan to continue enhancing our position as a low-cost operator over time while employing ongoing cost discipline to reduce certain expenses as a percentage of sales. Nonetheless, we seek to maintain flexibility to invest in the business as necessary to enhance our long-term competitiveness and profitability. From time to time, our strategic initiatives, including without limitatio"
