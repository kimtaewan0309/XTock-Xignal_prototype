Our end-to-end, digitally connected supply chain ecosystem is designed to optimize the flexibility and agility of our route-to-market. Reliability and resiliency remain our priority throughout our fit-for-purpose supply chain, ensuring that we can deliver our products to our customers and consumers whenever and wherever they need them.\nOur supply chain network is purpose-built to deploy resources across the globe where they are most needed. Our sourcing, manufacturing, and demand planning capabilities are continuously optimized to meet evolving market dynamics. Our extensive distribution network and sales organization enable us to establish strategic partnerships with key suppliers and retailers across multiple markets and channels, where we further leverage our scale to drive flexible manufacturing capacity and supply chain optimization.

The principal raw materials used in our products include resins, silicon, pulp and corn derivatives, paper, agrochemicals, vegetable oils, and oleochemicals. The majority of raw and packaging materials used are purchased from third parties and available from several sources. We do purchase certain raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers; however, no single supplier provides a significant portion of our total material requirements. Certain raw and packaging material commodities are subject to market price variations. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nVolatility in the cost or availability of raw materials and other inputs for our products, including due to military conflicts, has adversely affected, and could in the future continue to adversely affect us.”\nManufacturing Footprint\nOur in-house manufacturing footprint delivered over 60% of our sales volume during the fiscal year 2024, with the remaining sales volume being supplied by an extensive network of external manufacturing facilities operated by trusted third-party\nsuppliers. This combination provides us with significant operational flexibility enhancing our ability to respond to demand while optimizing capital allocation.\nWarehousing and Distribution Capabilities\nOur distribution network is designed to respond to increasingly complex consumer and customer demand. The majority of our distribution centers are operated in partnership with expert third-party operators in order to leverage their scale, expertise, and technology platforms. In all cases, whether in-house or external, our distribution centers must comply with our rigorous quality compliance standards and are subject to our audit process.\nQuality Control and Compliance\nWith a rigorous approach to product safety and quality control, we have a strong culture of quality across our end-to-end organization enhanced by rigorous compliance procedures. We invest in quality systems and data analytics platforms to further drive proactive quality management and improve the effectiveness of our quality control system.\nSuppliers are key partners in our commitment to quality and therefore are expected to provide services and goods that consistently meet our quality standards. In order to ensure compliance with our high-quality standards, we conduct regular quality audits of our supplier base and their facilities.\nOur supply chain is also subject to external audits by national regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), which conduct multiple regulatory inspections every year.\nThe consumer health and personal care sectors are large and dynamic, with a significant number of competitors that vary from well-established consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) companies with well-known legacy businesses globally to emerging niche-oriented brands.\nGiven the breadth of our portfolio and global footprint, we compete with a broad set of competitors that include 1) consumer healthcare businesses that are either independent or part of larger pharmaceutical groups, 2) global CPG companies that operate in similar or adjacent categories, 3) regional companies that operate in our categories within the markets in which we compete, 4) generic OTC manufacturers and retailers’, including our customers’, private-label brands in both traditional retail and online, and 5) emerging niche-oriented brands in our categories with distribution either through traditional retail, online, or direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels. Across our three reportable business segments, we experience significant degrees of competition.\nOur key competitors for each segment globally include:\nHaleon, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser Group, and private-label brands\nSkin Health and Beauty\n. Beiersdorf, Estée Lauder, L’Oréal, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and private-label brands\n. Church & Dwight, Colgate-Palmolive, Kimberly Clark, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and private-label brands\nSee Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional information on our competitive risks.\nHealthy Lives Mission\nOur ESG management approach is designed to effectively govern and manage impacts and risks while also enabling us to identify opportunities that accelerate innovation and profitable growth and drive business value for all our stakeholders. Our Healthy Lives Mission, which is our ESG strategy, includes public goals and commitments intended to position our brands as more positive choices for both people and the planet and to help manage ESG-related impacts, risks, and opportunities. Kenvue’s Healthy Lives Mission is our call for everyday care in action and is supported by three pillars: nurture Healthy People, enrich a Healthy Planet, and maintain Healthy Practice. Within these three pillars, we are focused on nine priority areas for which we have established goals and commitments to hold ourselves accountable and demonstrate progress as outlined in our Healthy Lives Mission Report.\nWe will continue to provide more details about our progress against these goals and commitments in our upcoming Healthy Lives Mission Report. For more information on our climate-related risks and opportunities informed by the recommendations\nof the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”), see our inaugural TCFD Report, which will be reviewed and updated periodically.

  "item7_clean": "for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 as compared to 56.0% for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Changes in both Cost of sales and gross profit margin were primarily due to gains attributable to the realization of benefits associated with our supply chain optimization initiatives. Gross profit margin also increased due to value realization.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses were $6.3 billion and $6.1 billion for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, an increase of $188 million, or 3.1%. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased 120 basis points to 41.0% for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, as compared to 39.8% for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to higher expenses related to brand support, including advertising and healthcare professional engagement, as we increased our investment to further support sales across segments and geographies, and an additional quarter of incremental ongoing public company costs not incurred last year. These cost increases were partially offset by savings from Our Vue Forward and a $217 million decrease in Separation-related costs.\nRestructuring Expenses\nRestructuring expenses were $185 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, driven by costs incurred under Our Vue Forward related to global workforce reductions, changes in management structure, and the transition to centralized shared-service functions in lower-cost locations, as we began strategic initiatives intended to enhance organizational efficiencies and better position Kenvue for future growth. This includes employee-related costs, information technology and project-related costs, and other implementation costs. See Note 19, “Restructuring Expenses and Operating Model Optimization Initiatives,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nImpairment charges were $578 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, which primarily included a non-cash charge of $488 million ($337 million after-tax) to adjust the carrying value of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment related to the Dr.Ci:Labo\nskin health business. The impairment was due primarily to revisions to internal forecasts for the business as a result of updates in our strategy to reach more consumers and appropriately address evolving market dynamics, including shifts in consumer sentiment in China as well as changing shopping patterns in the region. The increase also included the impact of a $68 million non-cash impairment charge related to our interim corporate headquarters in Skillman, New Jersey, which was classified as held for sale on February 21, 2024. Additionally, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $22 million related to certain software development assets. See Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies—Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\nOther operating expense (income), net was $26 million and $(10) million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a change of $36 million. Expense for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 was driven by the $59 million accounting impact of net economic benefit arrangements with J&J in connection with the Deferred Local Businesses (see Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information), partially offset by $34 million of royalty income. Income for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was driven by the prior period reversal of a $45 million contingent liability that was no longer considered to be probable, $35 million of royalty income, and a $9 million gain recognized on the sale of a manufacturing facility in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023, partially offset by the $28 million accounting impact of net economic benefit arrangements with J&J in connection with the Deferred Local Businesses, and $26 million of litigation expense. See Note 13, “Other Operating Expense (Income), Net and Other Expense, Net,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nOther expense, net was $48 million and $72 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $24 million. Expense for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 was driven by $72 million in losses on investments, partially offset by a $21 million\n\ngain recognized on the release of tax indemnification reserves that were no longer considered to be probable. Expense for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was driven by $58 million in currency losses on transactions and $7 million in losses on investments. See Note 13, “Other Operating Expense (Income), Net and Other Expense, Net,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net was $378 million and $250 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, an increase of $128 million. The increase in expense was driven by an additional quarter of interest expense recognized on the Senior Notes and notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program not incurred last fiscal year, along with $33 million of interest income recognized in the fiscal three months ended July 2, 2023 in relation to the Facility Agreement (as defined in Note 5, “Borrowings—Facility Agreement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein) as well as interest income earned in the fiscal six months ended July 2, 2023 on debt proceeds in escrow. See Note 5, “Borrowings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nProvision for taxes was $385 million and $526 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $141 million. The decrease in Provision for taxes was primarily due to lower year-to-date income in comparison to the prior fiscal period as a result of the Dr.Ci:Labo\nskin health business impairment for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and the recording of a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to future foreign tax benefits in the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease is offset by fewer releases of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and reduced tax benefits derived from the Separation as compared to the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 as well as unfavorable return-to-provision adjustments and shortfall on stock-based compensation recorded during the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024. In addition, the worldwide effective income tax rates for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 27.2% and 24.0%, respectively. See Note 14, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nSegment profit is based on Operating income, excluding depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, Separation-related costs, restructuring and operating model optimization initiatives, impairment charges, the impact of the conversion of stock-based awards, issuance of Founder Shares (as defined below), Other operating expense (income), net, and unallocated general corporate administrative expenses (referred to herein as “Segment adjusted operating income”), as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the “CODM) excludes these items in assessing segment financial performance. General corporate/unallocated expenses, which include expenses related to treasury, legal operations, and certain other expenses, along with gains and losses related to\nthe overall management of our Company, are not allocated to the segments. In assessing segment performance and managing operations, the CODM does not review segment assets.\nSee Note 18, “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.\nA detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 is presented below. A detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023 can be found under the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II., Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report.\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended December 29, 2024 Compared with Fiscal Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\nThe following tables presents Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income and the period-over-period changes in Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023. During the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-07, as described in more detail in Note 1, “Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies— Recently Adopted Accounting Standards,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. See Note 18, “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further details regarding Segment net sales and Segment adjusted operating income.\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended\nChange In Fiscal Year\n(Dollars in Millions)\nSkin Health and Beauty\nSkin Health and Beauty\nSegment adjusted Cost of sales\nOther segment expense items\nSegment adjusted operating income\n\nwe no longer participate in J&J’s corporate-wide cash management and centralized funding programs.\nSummarized cash flow information for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nChange In Fiscal Year\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended\n(Dollars in Millions)\nNet changes in assets and liabilities\nNet cash flows from operating activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities\nNet cash flows used in financing activities\n* Calculation not meaningful.\nA detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in the results for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 is presented below. A detailed discussion of the period-over-period changes in the results for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and the fiscal twelve months ended January 1, 2023 can be found under the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II., Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows from operating activities were $1.8 billion and $3.2 billion for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $1,399 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in working capital balances driven by a net decrease in Accounts payable and Accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments and an increase in Trade receivables due to the timing of sales and collections.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $425 million and $488 million for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $63 million. Net cash flows used in investing activities were primarily driven by purchases of property, plant, and equipment in both the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets in the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, a decrease of $962 million. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 were primarily driven by $1,552 million of dividends paid and $235 million of payments made to purchase treasury stock, partially offset by $157 million of net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper under the Commercial Paper Program (as defined below). Net cash flows used in financing activities for the fiscal twelve months ended December 31, 2023 were primarily driven by $13.8 billion in distributions to J&J in connection with the Separation, $766 million of dividends paid, and Net transfers to J&J of $274 million, partially offset by approximately $7.7 billion of net proceeds from Senior Notes (as defined below), $4.2 billion of proceeds from the sale of common stock in connection with the Kenvue IPO, and $574 million of net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper under the Commercial Paper Program. Net transfers to J&J were driven by cash pooling and general financing activities, indirect corporate cost allocations from J&J, and taxes deemed to be settled with J&J. For further details regarding Net transfers to J&J, see Note 12, “Relationship with J&J—Net Transfers to J&J,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, which consisted of Cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion as of December 29, 2024, cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) of $4.0 billion, and authorized Commercial Paper Program issuance of $4.0 billion. As of December 29, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $797 million of outstanding balances under our Commercial Paper Program, net of a related discount of $3 million.\nOur ability to fund our operating needs will depend on our ability to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations and on our ability to obtain debt financing on acceptable terms or to issue additional equity or equity-linked securities. Based upon our history of generating positive cash flows, we believe our existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to service our current obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nManagement believes that our cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, along with borrowing capacity and access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide adequate liquidity to meet all of our current and long-term obligations when due, including third-party debt that we incurred in connection with the Separation, adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures, and flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms in the future.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by $312 million during the fiscal twelve months ended December 29, 2024 to $1,070 million as of December 29, 2024, as compared to $1,382 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was $1,044 million and $1,336 million as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nAs part of our continued transformation to a fit-for-purpose consumer company, during the fiscal year 2024, we began Our Vue Forward to enhance organizational efficiencies and better position Kenvue for future growth. To further Our Vue Forward, on May 6, 2024, our Board approved the 2024 Multi-Year Restructuring Initi",
