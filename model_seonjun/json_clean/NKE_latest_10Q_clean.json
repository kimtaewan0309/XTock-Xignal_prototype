Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 were $11.7 billion compared to $11.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues decreased 1%, primarily due to lower revenues in Greater China and Converse, which reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 2 and 1 percentage points, respectively. Higher revenues in North America increased NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 2 percentage points.\nNIKE Brand revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and were flat on a currency-neutral basis.\nNIKE Brand footwear revenues decreased 2% on a currency-neutral basis. Unit sales of footwear increased 2%, while lower average selling price (\"ASP\") per pair reduced footwear revenues by approximately 4 percentage points. Lower ASP per pair was primarily due to channel mix and higher discounts.\nNIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Unit sales of apparel increased 10%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 3 percentage points. Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to higher discounts and channel mix, partially offset by product mix.\nNIKE Brand wholesale revenues increased 7% on a reported basis and 5% on a currency-neutral basis. The increase on a currency-neutral basis was driven by higher revenues in North America, Europe, Middle East & Africa (\"EMEA\") and Asia Pacific & Latin America (\"APLA\"), partially offset by a decrease in Greater China.\nNIKE Direct revenues were $4.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, compared to $4.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues decreased 5% due to declines in NIKE Brand Digital sales of 12% from $2.3 billion in first quarter of fiscal 2025 to $2.0 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and declines in NIKE stores sales of 1%. Comparable store sales decreased 1%.

This includes liquidating inventory through increased markdowns across NIKE Direct, and higher sales returns and discounts with our wholesale partners to reduce inventory and create capacity for new product. We are also making investments to elevate the presentation of our brands in physical retail.\nIncreasing investment in demand creation, including brand marketing and sports marketing, to support key product launches and sports moments.\nOur reportable operating segments are at different stages of progress against these actions and therefore, the timing of financial impacts have varied and we expect will continue to vary by segment. These actions have had, and in the future will have, a negative impact on our Revenues and overall profitability. However, we believe these actions will reignite brand momentum and reposition our business to drive long-term shareholder value.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nEarnings Before Interest and Taxes (\"EBIT\"):\nCalculated as Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period in place of the exchange rates in use during the current period.\nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\nComparable store sales:\nThis key metric, which excludes NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales represents a performance metric that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies.\n\nTOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n% CHANGE\nDemand creation expense\nOperating overhead expense\nTotal selling and administrative expense\nDemand creation expense consists of brand marketing expense and sports marketing expense.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points.\nOperating overhead expense was flat due to higher wage-related expense and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, offset by lower other administrative costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point.\nOTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\nOther (income) expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions outside the normal course of business.\nFIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2026 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2025\nOther (income) expense, net decreased from $55 million of other income, net, to $23 million of other expense, net, in part due to a net unfavorable change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges.\nINCOME TAXES\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,\n% CHANGE\nFIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2026 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2025\nOur effective tax rate was 21.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, compared to 19.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, primarily due to decreased benefits from stock-based compensation.\nFor additional information, refer to Note 4 — Income Taxes within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nSee Note 10 — Segment Information in the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our segments and related information.\nThe breakdown of Revenues is as follows:\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n% CHANGE\n% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\nAsia Pacific & Latin America\nGlobal Brand Divisions\nTOTAL NIKE BRAND\n\nFIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2026 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2025\nNorth America revenues incr"
