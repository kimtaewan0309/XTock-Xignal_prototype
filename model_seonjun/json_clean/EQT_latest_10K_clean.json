  "item1_clean": "Regulation of our Operations.\nOur exploration and production operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including regulations related to the following: the location of wells; the method of drilling, well construction, well stimulation, hydraulic fracturing and casing design; water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes; well production; spill prevention plans; the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations; surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the calculation, reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes; and the gathering of production in certain circumstances. These regulations, and any delays in obtaining related authorizations, may affect the costs and timing of developing our natural gas resources.\nOur operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations, including the following: regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units; setbacks; the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells; drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures; and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties. Ohio allows the statutory pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration. In Pennsylvania, lease integration legislation authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases. West Virginia allows the operator of a proposed horizontal well to develop the acreage of non-consenting and unlocatable and unknown owners if 75% of the mineral interest owners and 55% of the working interest owners in the proposed well unit consent to the development. Additionally, state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas. Various states also impose certain regulatory requirements to transfer wells to third parties or discontinue operations in the event of divestitures by us.\nWe also have gathering and processing operations that are subject to various federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances, including the following: air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units and other permitting requirements; erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects; waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations; various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices; compliance with safety regulations, including regulations by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA); and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations. These regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of, and the time to develop, new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations.\nWe use financial derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices on our results of operations and cash flows. In 2010, Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that established federal oversight and regulation of the OTC derivative market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), required the CFTC, the SEC and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or alter their derivative activities. The Dodd-Frank Act also created new categories of regulated market participants, such as \"swap dealers\" (SDs) and \"security-based swap dealers\" (SBSDs) that are subject to significant new capital, registration, recordkeeping, reporting, disclosure, business conduct and other regulatory requirements, a large number of which have been implemented. This regulatory framework has significantly increased the costs of entering into derivatives transactions for end-users of derivatives, such as us. In particular, new margin requirements and capital charges, even when not directly applicable to us, have increased the pricing of derivatives that we transact in.\nNew exchange trading margin regulations, trade reporting requirements and position limits may lead to changes in the liquidity of our derivative transactions or higher pricing. That said, our hedging activities are not subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing, although we are subject to certain recordkeeping and reporting obligations associated with the Dodd-Frank Act. Additionally, our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements. Finally, we believe that the majority, if not all, of our hedging activities constitute bona fide hedging under applicable federal and exchange-mandated position limits rules and are not materially impacted by the limitations under such rules.\nIn addition to U.S. laws and regulations relating to derivatives, certain non-U.S. regulatory authorities have passed or proposed, or may propose in the future, legislation similar to that imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. For example, European Union legislation imposes position limits on certain commodity transactions, and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) requires reporting of derivatives and various risk mitigation techniques to be applied to derivatives entered into by parties that are subject to EMIR. Other similar regulations are in development throughout the globe and may increase our cost of doing business even if not directly binding on us.\nRegulators periodically review or audit our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. We anticipate that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing our current operations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, regulatory agencies and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on us.\nThe following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our business operations are subject.\nNatural Gas Sales and Transportation.\nThe availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. The FERC's regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transportation in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas.\nHistorically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production. The FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). Various federal laws enacted since 1978 have resulted in the removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales, which include all of our sales of our own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties of approximately $1.6 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our production activities have not been regulated by the FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, we are required to report the aggregate volume of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale to the extent such transactions exceed a specific volume and use, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. In addition, Congress may enact legislation or the FERC may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to further regulation. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalties.\nThe CFTC also holds authority to monitor certain segments of the physical, futures and other derivatives energy commodities markets, including natural gas, NGLs and oil. With regard to physical purchases and sales of natural gas and other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation and disruptive trading practices laws and related regulations enforced by the CFTC. The CFTC also holds substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to assess civil penalties.\nThe FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, the FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide non-unduly discriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. The FERC's initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas production activities.\nOur FERC-regulated operations are pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC that establish rates (other than market-based rate authority), cost recovery mechanisms and terms and conditions of service to customers. Generally, the FERC's authority extends to rates and charges for: our natural gas transmission and storage services; certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities; abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities; maintenance of accounts and records; relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates; terms and conditions of services and service contracts with customers; depreciation and amortization policies; acquisitions and dispositions of interstate transmission and storage facilities; and initiation and discontinuation of interstate transmission and storage services.\nUnless market-based rates have been approved by the FERC, the maximum applicable recourse rates and terms and conditions for service are set forth in the pipeline's FERC-approved tariff. Generally, the maximum filed recourse rates for interstate pipelines are based on ",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8., \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nRecent and Significant Events\nMidstream Joint Venture Transaction\nOn December 30, 2024, in connection with the completion of the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction, the Midstream Joint Venture received $3.5 billion of cash consideration, net of certain transaction fees and expenses, from a third-party investor in exchange for a noncontrolling equity interest in the Midstream Joint Venture. We used the proceeds from the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction to repay outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Facility (defined in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the Term Loan Facility and a portion of outstanding borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the Bridge Credit Facility were used to fund the redemption and repurchase of certain of EQM's senior notes, including pursuant to the EQM Tender Offer (defined in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nNEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestitures and NEPA Gathering System Acquisition\nResults of operations for 2024 include the results of our operation of assets received as consideration for the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, which closed on May 31, 2024. Such assets received included the remaining 16.25% equity interest in the NEPA Gathering System (defined in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) (which was the sole remaining minority interest following our acquisition of a 33.75% equity interest in the NEPA Gathering System Acquisition (defined in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) on April 11, 2024), resulting in our 100% ownership of the NEPA Gathering System. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, on December 31, 2024, we completed the Second NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We used the proceeds from the Second NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture of $1.25 billion, subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments and transaction costs, to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility.\nEquitrans Midstream Merger\nResults of operations for 2024 include the results of our operation of assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger, which closed on July 22, 2024. Following the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we own a gathering system with 1,975 miles of gathering lines (including gathering lines owned prior to the Equitrans Midstream Merger) and a transmission and storage system with approximately 950 miles of FERC-regulated, interstate pipelines. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor the period from July 22, 2024 through December 31, 2024, our consolidated gathering expense decreased due to our ownership of the gathering and transmission assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger. Our ownership of such assets will continue to positively impact our Production segment's gathering expense, with a corresponding increase to our Production segment's affiliate transportation and processing expense, which is eliminated in consolidation. This relationship will be prominent for full year 2025 results and beyond.\nTug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition\nResults of operations for 2024 and the second half of 2023 include the results of our operation of assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition (defined in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which closed on August 22, 2023.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nOn March 4, 2024, we announced our decision to strategically curtail approximately 1.0 Bcfe per day of gross production (the Strategic Curtailment) beginning on February 24, 2024 in response to the low natural gas price environment resulting from warm winter weather and elevated storage inventories. The Strategic Curtailment resulted in total decreased sales volume of 107 Bcfe for 2024. In addition, certain operators of wells in which we have a non-operating working interest also curtailed production in 2024. For 2024, we estimate that our total expected sales volume was negatively impacted by approximately 130 to 140 Bcfe of curtailments, including our Strategic Curtailment of 107 Bcfe and curtailments by certain operators of wells in which we have a non-operating working interest.\nLow natural gas prices or volatility in the natural gas market may result in adjustments to our 2025 planned development schedule or the development schedule of non-operated wells in which we have a working interest. Further, we cannot control or otherwise influence the development schedule of non-operated wells in which we have a working interest. Adjustments to our 2025 planned development schedule or the development schedule of non-operated wells in which we have a working interest, including due to declines in natural gas prices, the pace of well completions, access to sand and water to conduct drilling operations, access to sufficient pipeline takeaway capacity, unscheduled downtime at processing facilities or otherwise, could impact our future sales volume, operating revenues and expenses, per unit metrics and capital expenditures.\nIn connection with the recent U.S. election and corresponding inauguration of President Trump on January 20, 2025, the President executed several executive orders, some of which impact the oil and gas industry, and he and others in Congress have indicated the potential for further changes to regulations, many of which could impact the oil and gas industry, as well as the institution of tariffs on foreign goods and services. It is uncertain at this time to what extent such changes in regulations and tariffs will impact our business. A changing regulatory environment could increase our costs to comply with such regulations or make us susceptible to lawsuits or fines for failure to comply with such regulations. Further, tariffs on foreign goods and services could result in other countries instituting tariffs on U.S. goods and services, which could impact the price of natural gas, increase the price of supplies and raw materials that we rely on to conduct our business, and could impact interest rates. A changing regulatory environment and domestic or foreign tariffs could ultimately impact our future sales volume, operating revenues and expenses, per unit metrics and capital expenditures.\nLastly, we expect commodity prices to be volatile through 2025 due to macroeconomic uncertainty, changes to the regulatory environment and geopolitical tensions, including developments pertaining to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East and potential further imposition of domestic and foreign tariffs. Our revenue, profitability, liquidity and financial position will continue to be impacted in the future by the market prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, NGLs and oil.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\nNet income attributable to EQT Corporation for 2024 was $231 million, $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $1,735 million, $4.22 per diluted share, for 2023. The decrease was attributable primarily to a lower gain on derivatives, increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, increased other operating expenses and increased net interest expense, partly offset by the gains on the NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestitures, decreased income tax expense, increased pipeline revenues and decreased transportation and processing expense.\nSee Item 7., \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in our Annual Report on\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023, which is incorporated herein by reference, for discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe did not recast our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 for our change in reportable segments as such change does not materially change our historic comparative discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included within the 2023 Annual Report. Prior to the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we operated our business as a single segment and did not generate material third-party gathering operating income. Further, in our judgment, we do not believe such a recast is necessary to an understanding of our business, financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information by business segment, including our profit and loss metric and capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022 and segment assets as of December 31, 2022.\nSee \"Average Realized Price Reconciliation\" for a discussion and calculation of our average realized price, which is based on our Production segment's adjusted operating revenues (Production adjusted operating revenues), a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that has been reconciled from total Production operating revenues in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation.\" See \"Business Segment Results of Operations\" for a discussion of segment operating revenues and expenses and \"Other Income Statement Items\" for a discussion of other income statement items. See \"Investing Activities\" under \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" for a discussion of capital expenditures, including by business segment.\nAverage Realized Price Reconciliation\nThe following table presents detailed natural gas and liquids operational information to assist in the understanding of our consolidated operations, including the calculation of our average realized price ($/Mcfe), which is based on Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure. Production adjusted operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure we use to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. Production adjusted operating revenues should not be considered as an alternative to total Production operating revenues. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation\" for a reconciliation of Production adjusted operating revenues from total Production operating revenues, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nYears Ended December 31,\n(Thousands, unless otherwise noted)\nNATURAL GAS\n\n(Thousands, unless otherwise noted)\nTotal sales volume (MMcfe)\nAverage daily sales volume (MMcfe/d)\nAverage sales price ($/Mcfe)\nSales of natural gas, NGLs and oil\nPipeline, net marketing services and other\nTotal operating revenues\nTransportation and processing:\nTransportation and processing to affiliate (a)\nTotal transportation and processing\nLOE\nSelling, general and administrative (b)\nProduction depletion\nOther depreciation and depletion\n(Gain) loss on sale/exchange of long-lived assets\nImpairment and expiration of leases\nOther operating expenses\nTotal operating expenses\nTransportation and processing to affiliate (a)\nLOE\nSelling, general and administrative (b)\nProduction depletion\nTransportation and processing to affiliate represents intercompany transactions with our Gathering and Transmission segments, which are eliminated in consolidation.\nSelling, general and administrative expense incurred prior to the Equitrans Midstream Merger closing date was not recast as the necessary information is not available and the cost to develop such information would be excessive.\nSales of natural gas, NGLs and oil.\nSales of natural gas, NGLs and oil decreased for 2024 compared to 2023 by approximately $110 million, of which approximately $640 million was attributable to lower average sales price, which was partly offset by approximately $530 million attributable to increased sales volumes. The average sales price decreased for 2024 compared to 2023 due to a lower NYMEX price, partly offset by lower basis spreads and higher NGLs price. Sales volume increased for 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of sales volume increases of 164 Bcfe from the assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition as well as increases from wells turned-in-line, partly offset by sales volume decreases of 107 Bcfe from the Strategic Curtailment and net decreases of 21 Bcfe due to the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture. The increase in sales volume had a favorable impact on per unit costs for 2024 compared to 2023.\nProduction gain on derivatives.\nFor 2024, we recognized a gain on derivatives of approximately $68 million related primarily to increases in the fair market value of our NYMEX swaps and options of approximately $377 million due to decreases in NYMEX forward prices, partly offset by decreases in the fair market value of our basis swaps of approximately $309 million. For 2023, we recognized a gain on derivatives of approximately $1,839 million related primarily to increases in the fair market value of our NYMEX swaps and options of approximately $1,830 million due to decreases in NYMEX forward prices as well as increases in the fair market value of our basis swaps of approximately $9 million.\nTransportation and processing\nGathering expense decreased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to our Gathering segment's ownership of the gathering assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger, our Transmission segment's ownership of the transmission and storage assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger and our Gathering segment's ownership of the additional interest in the NEPA Gathering System acquired in the NEPA Gathering System Acquisition and as consideration for the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture.\n\nTransmission expense increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to capacity charges related to the in service of the MVP (which commenced long-term firm capacity obligations on July 1, 2024) of approximately $165 million, additional contracted capacity on the Columbia Gas and Transco pipelines of an aggregate approximate $47 million and credits received in 2023 from pipeline credits of approximately $14 million. We record our equity earnings from our investment in the MVP Joint Venture in income from investments in our Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nProcessing expense increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to increased processing expense from the liquids-rich properties acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition of approximately $40 million and increased volumes of gas requiring processing from wells that we turned-in-line in 2024.\nTransportation and processing to affiliate.\nAffiliate transportation and processing expense increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to our Gathering segment's ownership of the gathering assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger, our Transmission segment's ownership of the transmission and storage assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger and our Gathering segment's ownership of the additional interest in the NEPA Gathering System acquired in the NEPA Gathering System Acquisition and as consideration for the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture. In addition, affiliate transportation and processing expense increased on a per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due to our Gathering segment's ownership of the gathering assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition during the third quarter of 2023.\nLOE.\nLOE increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to i",
