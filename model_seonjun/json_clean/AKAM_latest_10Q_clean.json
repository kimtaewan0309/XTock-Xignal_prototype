Additionally, software and related service costs increased as we transition to and expand usage of cloud-based applications to support our operations. These increases were partially offset by acquisition-related costs from our acquisition of Noname Gate Ltd. (\"Noname Security\") in 2024 that did not recur in 2025.\nDuring the remainder of 2025, we do not expect significant increases in general and administrative expenses as compared to 2024 as we plan to continue to carefully manage costs in an effort to support the operations of the business.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nFor the Three Months\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\nAs a percentage of revenue\nThe increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024, was the result of amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our acquisitions in 2024. Based on acquired intangible assets at September 30, 2025, we expect amortization of acquired intangible assets to be approximately $27.9 million for the remainder of 2025, and $104.0 million, $89.2 million, $81.8 million and $75.9 million for 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029, respectively.\nRestructuring Charge\nFor the Three Months\nRestructuring (benefit) charge\nAs a percentage of revenue\nThe restructuring (benefit) charge for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily driven by management's commitment to redeploy headcount and resources to support our faster growing security and cloud computing solutions. The charges recognized during these periods include severance and related expenses for certain headcount reductions and impairments to capitalized internal-use software. We do not expect to incur material additional charges related to this action.\nThe restructuring charge for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by management's commitment to an action initiated during the third quarter of 2024 with the primary intent to redeploy resources to support our strategic investments and as a result of our completed acquisitions. The restructuring charge included severance and related expenses for certain headcount reductions, as well as impairments of acquired intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software. We do not expect to incur material additional charges related to these actions.\nNon-Operating Income\nFor the Three Months\nInterest and marketable securities income, net\nAs a percentage of revenue\nAs a percentage of revenue\nAs a percentage of revenue\nInterest and marketable securities income, net consists of interest earned on invested cash and marketable securities balances and income and losses on mutual funds that are associated with our employee non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, was primarily due to investing in marketable securities at lower rates of return due to lower market interest rates in 2025 as compared to 2024 and lower average investment balances for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024 was due to a reduction of cash and marketable securities balances and re-positioning our investments to cash equivalents, yielding lower interest, in 2025 in order to repay our $1,150.0 million convertible senior notes that became due in May 2025. This decrease was partially offset by interest earned as a result of purchases of new marketable securities during the quarter with the proceeds of our convertible senior notes due 2033.\nInterest expense is related to our debt transactions, which are described in Note 6 to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.\nOther expense, net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency and gains and losses on cost method investments, as well as other non-operating expense and income items. Other expense, net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the Three Months\nProvision for income taxes\nAs a percentage of revenue\nEffective income tax rate\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, our provision for income taxes increased due to an increase in profitability and a shortfall in the tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in foreign income taxed at lower rates and a decrease in global intangible low-taxed income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, our provision for income taxes increased due to a shortfall in the tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, an increase in profitability and an increase in certain tax reserves.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, a change in the valuation allowance recorded against state credits and the benefit of U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. These amounts were partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation and an increase in certain tax reserves. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our effective income tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate due to non-deductible stock-based compensation, an increase in certain tax reserves and a shortfall in the tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These amounts were partially offset by foreign income taxed at lower rates and the benefit of U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our effective income tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate due to non-deductible stock-based compensation, partially offset by the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, foreign income taxed at lower rates and the benefit of U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, foreign income taxed at lower rates and the benefit of U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. These amounts were partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation and the adoption of a 15% global minimum corporate income tax by certain OECD member countries.\nIn determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, annualized effective income tax rates and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. Judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing financial measurements based on GAAP, we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (\"non-GAAP financial measures\"). Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as discussed below.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate comparison of financial results across accounting periods and may be comparable to those of our peer companies. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-GAAP financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:\nAm"
