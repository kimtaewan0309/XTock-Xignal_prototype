Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial and Operating Overview\nFinancial and operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect the following:\nNet income increased $525 million from $824 million, or $1.11 per share, in 2024 to $1.3 billion, or $1.77 per share, in 2025.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $882 million, from $2.2 billion in 2024 to $3.1 billion in 2025.\nEquivalent production increased 25.9 MMBoe from 184.9 MMBoe, or 674.8 MBoe per day, in 2024 to 210.8 MMBoe, or 772.0 MBoe per day, in 2025.\nOil production increased 12.8 MMBbl from 29.4 MMBbl, or 107.4 MBbl per day, in 2024 to 42.2 MMBbl, or 154.6 MBbl per day, in 2025.\nNatural gas production increased 44.0 Bcf from 769.1 Bcf, or 2,806.8 MMcf per day, in 2024 to 813.1 Bcf, or 2,978.5 MMcf per day, in 2025.\nNGL volumes increased 5.8 MMBbl from 27.3 MMBbl, or 99.6 MBbl per day, in 2024 to 33.1 MMBbl, or 121.1 MBbl per day, in 2025.\nAverage realized prices (including impact of derivatives):\nOil was $65.89 per Bbl in 2025, 13 percent lower than the $76.17 per Bbl realized in 2024.\nNatural gas was $2.52 per Mcf in 2025, 53 percent higher than the $1.65 per Mcf realized in 2024.\nNGL price was $19.29 per Bbl in 2025, two percent lower than the $19.59 per Bbl realized in 2024.\nTotal capital expenditures for drilling, completion and other fixed assets were $1.8 billion in 2025 compared to $1.3 billion in the corresponding period of the prior year.\nOther financial highlights for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 include the following:\nClosed two acquisitions in January 2025 in the Delaware Basin in New Mexico for total consideration of $3.3 billion in cash and the issuance of 28,190,682 shares of our common stock valued at $785 million based on the closing price of our common stock on the closing date of the transactions.\nIncreased our quarterly dividend from $0.21 per share to $0.22 per share in February 2025.\nRepaid the full $500 million of the Tranche A Term Loan and paid down $100 million of the Tranche B Term Loan.\n2 million shares of our common stock for $47 million.\nMarket Conditions and Commodity Prices\nOur financial results depend on many factors, particularly commodity prices and our ability to find and develop oil and gas reserves and market our production on economically attractive terms. Commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which can be impacted by pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials, weather conditions, and geopolitical, economic and other factors.\nWhile oil prices were relatively steady throughout 2024, prices have declined in 2025, with the largest decline occurring in April 2025 in both spot and forward pricing. Throughout 2025, forward pricing for oil prices has continued to decline due to growing global inventories and increased production quotas that have been announced by OPEC+ in the second and third quarters of 2025. Global oil demand continues to be projected by some, including the International Energy Agency, to be adversely impacted by escalating trade tensions as a result of U.S. economic policy, including tariffs and retaliatory tariffs. However, these forecasts are subject to volatile market conditions, including ongoing shifts in U.S. and international trade policy, as well as geopolitical risk and uncertainty, including political and military disputes. The impacts of these changes remain to be seen.\nNatural gas prices, which rose in early 2025, have continued to trend downward through the third quarter, driven in part by lower natural gas power burns in the first and second quarter and record high domestic production. Heading into 2026, forward pricing for natural gas prices has increased, in part as a result of anticipated colder temperatures, shifting weather models, and expected growing LNG demand. However, shifting U.S. and international trade policy and related uncertainty, including potential retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports of LNG, continue to contribute to ongoing volatility in natural gas pricing. Additionally, basis differentials have persisted in the U.S., with prices at the Waha Hub in the Permian Basin particularly depressed due to pipeline maintenance and production oversupply, reaching negative spot pricing at various times in September 2025. Despite these headwinds, we continue to expect natural gas prices overall to be stronger in 2025 and heading into 2026 compared to 2024.\nIn recent months, the potential for increasing tariffs has remained a contributing factor to increased volatility in commodity markets and uncertainty in the general economic outlook. Higher tariffs could result in increased costs of materials used in our operations, less ready access to capital markets or less favorable general economic conditions. The uncertainty surrounding tariff policies has led to fluctuations in commodity prices which could impact our ability to forecast future results. We are continuing to monitor developments related to tariff policies.\nAlthough the current outlook on oil and natural gas prices is generally favorable, and our operations have not been significantly impacted in the short-term, in the event further disruptions occur or the current market volatility and U.S. and international economic policy uncertainty continues for an extended period of time, our operations could be adversely impacted, commodity prices could decline and our costs may increase. We expect commodity price volatility to continue, including as a result of U.S. and international economic policy (such as tariffs or retaliatory tariffs), actions of OPEC+ (including the ability of OPEC+ to successfully coordinate production quotas) and potentially swift near- and medium-term fluctuations in supply and demand, such as potential changes to drilling and capital programs in the short term by U.S. producers. While we are unable to predict future commodity prices, at current oil, natural gas and NGL price levels, we do not believe that an impairment of our oil and gas properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future. However, in the event that commodity prices significantly decline or costs significantly increase from current levels, our management would evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties.\nIn addition, some governments, companies, communities and other stakeholders are supporting efforts to address climate change. As a result, such efforts have resulted in both existing and pending legislation and regulatory measures (including at the state, national and international level). Significant uncertainty remains as to the proposed changes in these laws or regulations, which, if adopted, may result in delays or restrictions in permitting and the development of our projects, increases to our costs, impair our ability to move forward with our construction, completions, drilling, water management, waste handling, storage, transport and remediation activities, or more competitive renewable energy alternatives that are able to more effectively compete with traditional oil and natural gas-derived products (including government subsidies and incentives for electric vehicles), any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nFor information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our revenues, refer to “Results of Operations” below.\nRecent U.S. Tax Legislation\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. enacted significant tax legislation under H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”). The effects of the provisions of the OBBBA have been reflected in our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2025. While the enactment of the OBBBA did not result in a material change to our total income tax expense, it had a material impact on the allocation between current and deferred taxes. Specifically, the reinstatement of 100 percent bonus depreciation and immediate expensing of domestic research and development costs resulted in a significant reduction to current tax expense, with a corresponding increase in deferred tax expense.\nOur 2025 full-year capital program is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with our operating cash flow. We expect to turn-in-line 194 to 198 total net wells in 2025 across our three\noperating regions. We currently expect to invest approximately 67 percent of our capital expenditures in the Permian Basin, 14 percent in the Marcellus Shale, 10 percent in the Anadarko Basin and the remaining nine percent for gathering systems infrastructure, saltwater disposal and other capital expenditures.\nIn 2024, we drilled 313 gross wells (159.4 net) and turned-in-line 294 gross wells (153.0 net). For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our capital program focused on the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale and Anadarko Basin, where we drilled 154.6 net wells and turned in line 146.4 net wells. Our capital program for the remainder of 2025 will focus on execution of our 2025 plan presented in our annual guidance. In the normal course of our business, we will continue to assess the oil and natural gas price macro environments and may adjust our capital allocation accordingly.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe strive to maintain an adequate liquidity level to address commodity price volatility and risk. Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of our planned capital expenditures (including acquisitions), payment of contractual obligations (including debt maturities and interest payments), working capital requirements, dividend payments and share repurchases. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may also from time-to-time refinance or retire our outstanding debt through privately negotiated transaction"
