Our long-term strategy continues to be to market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes, which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.\nOur casino operations feature a variety of slots and table games. In addition, we provide our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere.\nWe own approximately 56% of MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and holds the related gaming concession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Although visitation during 2022 was significantly reduced by the novel 2019 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, visitation during 2023 and 2024 rebounded, and we expect the long-term future growth of the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.\nOur current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations, which are conducted under a gaming concession held by MGM Grand Paradise, a subsidiary of MGM China. Gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to six different concessionaires.\nMGM Digital is our online gaming portfolio which is primarily comprised of LeoVegas, which is headquartered in Sweden and Malta and operates internationally, primarily in Europe, as well as our other consolidated subsidiaries that offer interactive gaming. Revenues are derived from its online gaming product offerings, which include iGaming, digital slots and table games, as well as live dealer and online sports betting.\nWe have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain other corporate and management operations. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are primarily comprised of our ventures, such as BetMGM North America Venture and Osaka IR KK.\nCustomers and Competition\nWe operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions — We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”\nOur primary methods of successfully competing include:\nLocating our properties in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;\nConstructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;\nRecruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;\nProviding unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions;\nInvesting in digital offerings and opportunities domestically and abroad; and\nDeveloping distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations\nOur customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions, trade associations, and small meetings. We have a diverse portfolio of properties, which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our properties have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our properties during midweek and off-peak periods.\nOur Las Vegas casino properties compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity and convention space offerings, or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.\nOutside Nevada, our properties primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where location is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region.\nThe Macau gaming market has two primary customer bases: main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations. The majority of MGM China’s casino revenue has been provided by main floor gaming operations in recent years and we expect this customer base will be the primary source of growth in the future. We offer amenities to attract players such as premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots to create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for premium main floor players’ use, as well as non-gaming amenities, such as The Mansion and MGM Cotai Emerald Villa to attract ultra-high end customers.\nOur key competitors in Macau include five other gaming concessionaires. We also encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world including, but not limited to, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Australia, and Las Vegas.\nOur digital customers are located within the geolocation of the jurisdictions in which we are licensed to operate. By operating in licensed markets, which are subject to costs in the form of gaming taxes, we benefit from higher barriers to entry, which changes the competitive picture and provides value to companies such as ours. Our primary competitors are\nother international online gaming companies. We also face competition from integrated resorts as well as other providers of entertainment.\nOur marketing strategy is deeply rooted in personalized engagement powered by advanced analytics to create experiences that resonate with our current and desired guests. Personalized marketing serves as a critical driver of growth for the company, enabling us to deepen customer loyalty, increase engagement, and enhance lifetime value by aligning our offerings with each guest segment’s unique preferences and needs. Central to this approach is MGM Rewards, our tiered loyalty program, which enables customers to earn benefits across gaming and non-gaming experiences. This program serves as a vital tool for capturing guest preferences and behaviors, allowing us to personalize interactions, offers, and experiences that are meaningful to each guest. As members progress through program tiers, they unlock exclusive benefits such as customized offers, priority access, and invitations to special events along with hotel stays, dining credits, and unique MGM Resorts experiences. At MGM China, we offer the M life loyalty program, which provides loyalty opportunities similar to MGM Rewards for non-gaming customers, and the Golden Lion Club for gaming focused customers. By incentivizing customers within our physical properties and with BetMGM North America Venture, we foster loyalty and increase customer lifetime value.\nIn addition to our loyalty programs, we leverage multiple marketing channels—including brand ambassadors, online, radio, television, print, and billboards in select U.S. and international cities. Our regional marketing offices and direct outreach channels via mail, email, and social media ensure consistent engagement. Our advanced data and analytics capabilities underpin our direct marketing, enabling us to segment customers based on preferences, behaviors, and their overall value to the organization. This segmentation allows us to deliver the highest level of personalized experiences across guest tiers, ensuring our product and program investments align with customer desires, drive incremental visits, and strengthen long-term relationships.\nWe leverage paid media and various social channels to reach our desired guests with precision, using targeted segmentation to deliver personalized content that resonates with specific customer interests and preferences. This allows us to engage high-value segments more effectively, amplifying brand loyalty and optimizing our marketing investments by connecting the right guests with the right offers and experiences.\nOur vision is to become\nthe world’s premier gaming entertainment company\n. We are focused on driving profitability in our integrated resorts in the U.S. and Macau, expanding our international brick-and-mortar footprint in the world’s premier gaming markets, growing our global digital brands, and efficient capital allocation. Our globally recognized brands, strategically located assets, development opportunities, and evolving digital platforms allow us to reach an unparalleled target addressable market.\nTo achieve our vision, we developed our strategic plan, which is built on five pillars:\n\nStrong People and Culture.\nRecruit, develop and retain the best talent. Cultivate a culture of respect and a workplace that reflects our communities, employees, partners, and stakeholders.\nCustomer-Centric Model\nPrioritize our customers by leveraging our collection of strong brands and insights from our leading customer loyalty program, MGM Rewards, to deliver exceptional entertainment experiences and revenue growth.\nGaming Entertainment.\nInnovate our gaming entertainment offerings to elevate",
  "item7_clean": "Las Vegas Strip Resorts\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nIncludes rent expense related to triple net operating and ground leases of $2.3 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.0 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 11 for discussion of our leases.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts Segment Adjusted EBITDAR decreased 3% compared to 2023. Las Vegas Strip Resorts Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin decreased to 35.2% in 2024 compared to 36.3% in 2023 due primarily to an increase in payroll-related expenses.\nRegional Operations Segment Adjusted EBITDAR increased 1% compared to 2023. Regional Operations Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin decreased to 30.7% in 2024 compared to 30.9% in 2023 due primarily to an increase in payroll\nrelated expenses, partially offset by the increase in casino revenues.\nMGM China’s Segment Adjusted EBITDAR increased 25% in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to the increase in casino revenues. MGM China’s Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin decreased to 27.0% in 2024 compared to 27.5% in 2023 due primarily to the increase in promotional expense and in lower margin non-gaming revenues, partially offset by the increase in casino revenues in 2024, discussed above.\nMGM Digital’s Segment Adjusted EBITDAR loss was $77 million in 2024 compared to $32 million 2023. The change was due primarily to the increase in marketing costs due to entry into new markets, partially offset by the increase in revenues in 2024.\nMGM Digital’s Segment Adjusted EBITDAR loss was $32 million in 2023 compared to Segment Adjusted EBITDAR of $0.4 million in 2022. The change is due primarily to a full year of operations of LeoVegas reflected for 2023 while 2022 included results of operations of LeoVegas from the date of acquisition of September 7, 2022 through December 31, 2022.\nOperating Results – Details of Certain Charges\nProperty transactions, net consisted of the following:\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n, with the exception of our MGM Digital segment, for which discussion as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 has been included below\nOur primary business is the operation of casino properties, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities, as well as the operation of digital gaming through our online platforms. We lease the real estate assets of our domestic properties pursuant to triple net lease agreements.\nOur results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results. Our results will also depend upon our ability to expand our ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities and accessing new markets for iGaming and online sports betting.\nOur results are also affected by significant recent developments in our business, which principally consist of transactions we have executed in furtherance of our businesses strategy and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the removal of COVID-19 travel restrictions in Macau and mainland China.\nOverview of strategic business developments\nIn July 2018, we and Entain formed BetMGM North America Venture. In connection with its formation, we provided BetMGM North America Venture with exclusive access to all of our domestic land based and online sports betting, major tournament poker, and online gaming operations, and Entain provided BetMGM North America Venture with exclusive access to its technology in the United States.\nOn September 28, 2021, we announced that we and ORIX were selected by Osaka as the region’s integrated resort partner. In December 2021, we and ORIX formed a venture, Osaka IR KK, through which we plan to develop the integrated resort. On April 27, 2022, we, together with Osaka prefecture/city, Osaka IR KK, and ORIX, submitted an ADP to Japan’s central government. On April 14, 2023, we announced that the Japanese government officially certified the ADP, and, in September 2023, Osaka IR KK signed an agreement with Osaka to implement the ADP. Preliminary construction began on the site of the future resort in 2024.\nOn April 29, 2022, VICI acquired MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”) in a stock-for-stock transaction (such transaction, the “VICI Transaction”). MGP Class A shareholders received 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and we received 1.366 units of VICI Properties OP LLC (“VICI OP”) in exchange for each MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (“MGP OP”) unit held by us. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP redeemed the majority of our VICI OP units, with us retaining an approximate 1% ownership interest in VICI OP. MGP’s Class B share that was held by us was cancelled. Accordingly, we no longer hold a controlling interest in MGP and deconsolidated MGP upon the closing of the transaction. In connection with the VICI Transaction, we entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. See Note 4 and Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the transaction and lease, respectively.\nOn May 17, 2022, we acquired the operations of The Cosmopolitan for cash consideration of $1.625 billion, plus working capital adjustments, for a total purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion. Additionally, we entered into\na lease agreement for the real estate assets of The Cosmopolitan. See Note 4 and Note 11 for discussion of the transaction and lease, respectively.\nIn June 2022, the Macau government enacted a new gaming law that provides for material changes to the legal form of gaming concessions in Macau, including discontinuing and prohibiting gaming subconcessions subsequent to their expiration, and also includes material changes to the rights and obligations provided for under the new gaming concessions that were awarded in the public tender that concluded in December 2022, such as limiting the term of concessions to a maximum of 10 years. As a result, we reassessed the useful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession intangible asset and reduced the useful life to align with the contractual term of the subconcession, which expired on December 31, 2022, thereby accelerating the recognition of amortization within our statements of operations. See Note 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In December 2022, we were awarded a new gaming concession, which permits the operation of games of chance or other games in casinos in Macau, commencing on January 1, 2023.\nOn September 7, 2022, we acquired LeoVegas through a tender offer at a cash price of SEK 61 per share, for a total fair value of equity interests acquired of approximately $556 million, inclusive of cash settlement of equity awards. See Note 4 for discussion of this transaction.\nOn December 19, 2022, we completed the sale of the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment, Inc. for cash consideration of $1.075 billion, or $1.1 billion, net of purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove The Mirage and reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 4 for further discussion of this transaction.\nOn February 15, 2023, we completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE Gaming Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Cherokee Nation Business, for cash consideration of $450 million, or $474 million, net of purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and reflect a $40 million reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 4 for further discussion of this transaction.\nIn August 2023, LeoVegas completed the acquisition of the majority ownership of Push Gaming, a digital gaming developer.\nIn September 2023, we identified a cybersecurity issue involving unauthorized access to certain of our U.S. systems by criminal actors. The Cybersecurity Issue, together with the incident response efforts, resulted in some disruptions to our business operations and we also incurred expenses for technology consulting services, legal fees and other third-party advisors in connection with this issue, which were not material to our 2023 results. We have cybersecurity insurance from which we began to receive proceeds in 2024.\nVisitation Statistics\nThe Las Vegas Strip segment results of operations are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Las Vegas visitor volume increased 2% compared to 2023 according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, primarily from sporting events hosted by Las Vegas in February 2024 as well as the general expansion of sporting, music, and entertainment events throughout 2024.\nThe MGM China segment results of operations also are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. On January 8, 2023, Macau lifted the majority of its COVID-19 pandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the exception of overseas visitors travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan being required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test result, and, on February 6, 2023, all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions were removed. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Macau visitor arrivals increased 24% compared to 2023 according to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, as 2024 was positively affected by the continued recovery after the removal of COVID-19 related travel and entry restrictions.\nKey Performance Indicators\nKey performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:\nGaming revenue indicators: table games drop, which is the total amount of cash and net markers issued and deposited into the drop box, and slot handle, which is the gross amount wagered in slot machines, (volume\nindicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. “Win” or “hold” percentages represent the net amount of gaming wins and losses in relation to table games drop or slot handle; and\nHotel revenue indicators (for Las Vegas Strip Resorts) – hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price indicator); and revenue per available room (“RevPAR,” a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.\nResults of Operations\n\nIncome before income taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nEffective income tax rate\nFederal, state and foreign income taxes paid, net of refunds\nOur effective rate for 2024 was favorably impacted primarily by an increase in Macau gaming profits which are exempt from complementary tax and a decrease in the valuation allowance for Macau deferred tax assets. Our effective rate for 2023 was favorably impacted primarily by a decrease in the valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards resulting from a projected increase in foreign source income and favorably impacted by an increase in Macau income offset by expiring net operating losses from prior years subject to valuation allowances. These changes were partially offset by an increase in incremental U.S. tax on foreign earnings.\nCash paid for income taxes decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the payment of income taxes in 2023 related to the disposition of The Mirage and Gold Strike Tunica, partially offset by the utilization of our remaining overall domestic loss in 2023 prior to fully sheltering 50% of domestic taxable income.\nCertain jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted legislation commencing in 2024 as well as future years influenced by the OECD Pillar Two framework, including a minimum tax rate of 15%. The enacted tax laws with respect to Pillar Two have not materially impacted our current year financial results and are not expected to materially impact future financial results. We are unable to predict when and how Pillar Two will be enacted into law or modified to align with OECD guidance in the jurisdictions in which we operate. It is possible that Pillar Two legislative changes could have a material impact on future financial results. We will continue to monitor worldwide regulatory developments as additional guidance is released.\nReportable Segment GAAP measure\n“Segment Adjusted EBITDAR” is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, triple net lease rent expense, loss from unconsolidated affiliates, and also excludes gain on REIT transactions, net as well as corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in consolidation. Triple net lease rent expense is the expense for rent to landlords under triple net operating leases for its domestic properties, the ground subleases of Beau Rivage and National Harbor, and the land concessions at MGM China. “Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin” is Segment Adjusted EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues.\n“Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, and gain on REIT transactions, net.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA information is a non-GAAP measure that is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because it is among the measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance, and because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a measure of operating performance in the gaming industry and as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are develop",
