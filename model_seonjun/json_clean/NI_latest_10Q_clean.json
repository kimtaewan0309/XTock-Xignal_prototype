The aggregate cost of the Generation Assets, together with the cost to develop related transmission infrastructure (collectively, the “Contract Assets”), is currently estimated to be approximately $7 billion. The EPC Contracts provide certain protections against cost overruns, and any excess costs with respect to the EPC Contracts beyond those protections, or arising apart from the EPC Contracts are, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, shared by Customer and NIPSCO (for transmission) and GenCo (for generation). If the Contract Assets are delivered into service late or do not achieve certain performance-related milestones, Customer is entitled to liquidated damages, subject to a cap and offset against the regular charges paid by the Customer.\nEither party may terminate the Data Center Contract upon certain defaults or failure to obtain necessary related approvals from the IURC and FERC. Customer may terminate the Data Center Contract for convenience following certain notice periods and also has a one-time option (exercisable no later than March 31, 2029) to halve the committed capacity under the Data Center Contract to 1,200 MW commencing January 31, 2032. If Customer terminates for convenience, exercises its reduction option or defaults, NIPSCO or its affiliates will be reimbursed for investment costs, subject to agreed caps based on cost estimates by year as of signing. NIPSCO’s aggregate liability, including liquidated damages, is subject to a cap.\nNIPSCO’s and GenCo’s operations under the Data Center Contract will be regulated by the IURC in a different way from the regulatory mechanisms applicable to NIPSCO’s historical operations. The terms of the Data Center Contract were determined by commercial negotiation with the Customer. These terms include the charges we receive from the Customer and provisions that may result in adjustments to such charges, including those relating to certain liquidated damages that we may owe Customer in the event of construction delays or capacity shortfalls, the parties’ responsibility to share cost overruns, certain changes in law and force majeure events. The IURC will not regulate the commercial terms of the Data Center Contract; however, the IURC will maintain oversight under the Data Center Contract to ensure NIPSCO provides reliable service to the Customer at just and reasonable rates. In order to recover our investment costs and earn our return under the Data Center Contract, our subsidiaries must efficiently perform their own obligations and must look to the Customer (or its parent guarantor) to perform its obligations, rather than the IURC making use of its traditional rate-making process. In addition, under the Data Center Contract, NIPSCO has direct contractual obligations to the Customer to, among other things, construct the Contract Assets and deliver committed electric capacity in fixed amounts by certain dates.\nData Center Strategy\nWe continue to experience strong demand from potential data center customers in our northern Indiana service territory and are engaged in negotiations with potential counterparties. Through certain of our subsidiaries, we have entered into certain construction and equipment supply contracts in relation to additional generation and transmission assets that may be used to serve potential future data center customers. As we continue to evaluate our potential data center opportunities, we will continue to focus on the community, financial, operational and regulatory factors that must be managed effectively in order to succeed with our data center strategy. We believe data center development can enhance our local tax base, diversify the employment base across the state of Indiana, and provide greater value to existing customers and shareholders. We continually evaluate ways to effectively manage the potential power demand, generation sources, and transmission capabilities to meet potential further load growth from additional data center customers, while at the same time focusing on our environmental goals.\nIn order to perform under any further data center contracts, we expect that we would need to develop additional generation and transmission assets and obtain additional financing in connection with such development. For these and other reasons, our ability to successfully execute our data strategy is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Refer to Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks relating to our data center strategy.\nWe continue to advance our energy transition strategy, primarily through the continuation and enhancement of existing programs, such as implementing our plan to retire and replace remaining coal-fired electric generation by 2028 with a balanced mix of low- or zero-emission electric generation, ongoing pipe replacement and modernization programs, and deployment of advanced leak detection and repair. Our electric generation transition, initiated through our 2018 Integrated Resource Plan (\"2018 Plan\") is well underway, and we are continually adjusting to the dynamic energy landscape. As of September 30, 2025, we have placed in service owned renewable and storage projects with combined nameplate capacities of 1,950 MW and 101 MW respectively. Renewable PPA projects with a combined nameplate capacity of 1,000 MW have also been placed in service. In addition, a renewable BTA project with a nameplate capacity of 200 MW, and a renewable PPA project with a nameplate capacity of 195 MW were under development as of September 30, 2025, all of which have received IURC approval. For additional information, see Note 14, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies - D. Other Matters\". We are continuing to evaluate the development of federal and state executive orders, or other regulatory actions, with respect to our generation transition plans. Absent a directive to remain open, we remain on track to retire R.M.

Increases in the costs that are subject to approved regulatory tracker mechanisms generally lead to increased regulatory assets, which ultimately result in a corresponding increases in operating revenues and expenses and, therefore, have essentially no impact on total operating income results. Certain approved regulatory tracker mechanisms allow for abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the operating companies to quickly implement revised rates and recover associated costs.\nA portion of the Columbia Operations' and NIPSCO Operations' revenue is related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs through standard regulatory proceedings. All states in our operating area require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to determine prudence and to confirm the recovery of prudently incurred energy commodity costs supplied to customers.\nWe recognize that energy efficiency reduces emissions, conserves natural resources and saves our customers money. Our gas distribution companies offer programs such as energy efficiency upgrades, home checkups and weatherization services. The increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards contributes to a long-term trend of declining average use per customer. While we are looking to expand offerings so the energy efficiency programs can benefit as many customers as possible, our gas distribution operations utilities have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred. Columbia of Ohio has adopted a straight fixed variable rate design for residential and small commercial customers that closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. Columbia of Maryland and Columbia of Virginia have regulatory approval for weather and revenue normalization adjustments for certain customer classes, which adjust monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels. Columbia of Pennsylvania continues to operate its pilot residential weather normalization adjustment and also has a fixed customer charge. This weather normalization adjustment only adjusts revenues when actual weather compared to normal varies by more than 3%. Columbia of Kentucky\ncharges certain customer classes a mix of fixed and weather normalized volumetric rates during the peak heating season. NIPSCO Gas and Electric include a fixed customer charge for residential and small commercial and industrial customer classes. NIPSCO Gas has implemented a weather normalization adjustment for certain of its customer classes.\nA portion of the NIPSCO Operations' revenue is related to the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These costs are recovered through a FAC, which is updated quarterly to reflect actual costs incurred to supply electricity to customers.\nWhile increased efficiency of electric appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards have similarly impacted the average use per electric customer in recent years, NIPSCO expects future growth in per customer usage as a result of increasing electric applications, such as electric vehicles. These ongoing changes in use of electricity will likely lead to development of innovative rate designs, and NIPSCO will continue efforts to design rates that increase the certainty of recovery of fixed costs.\nITEM 2.\n\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nRegulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters\nThe"
