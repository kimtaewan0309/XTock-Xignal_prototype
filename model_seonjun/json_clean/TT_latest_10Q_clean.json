We bring sustainable and efficient solutions to buildings, homes and transportation through our strategic brands, Trane\n, and our environmentally responsible portfolio of products, services and connected intelligent controls.\n2030 Sustainability Commitments\nOur commitment to sustainability extends to the environmental and social impacts of our people, operations, products and services. We continue to progress our ambitious 2030 Sustainability Commitments, including our Gigaton Challenge to reduce customers' carbon emissions by a billion metric tons through sustainable products and services. We are also Leading by Example as we work toward carbon-neutral operations, zero waste-to-landfill and net positive water use in water-stressed locations. We also committed to reducing embodied carbon in our products by 40%, while also designing products for circularity. Our 2030 emissions reduction targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), and we are one of very few companies worldwide with validated 2050 net-zero targets. Finally, our Opportunity for All commitment focuses on investing in our people and our uplifting and inclusive culture, and broadening access to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education and careers in our communities.\nOn January 2, 2025, we completed the acquisition of BrainBox AI Inc., a building management platform for HVAC optimization, using advanced artificial intelligence technologies. The results of the acquisition are reported within the Americas segment and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition.\nIn the first half of 2025, we also acquired multiple distributors with sales and service businesses in Europe that are reported in the EMEA segment from the dates of acquisition.\nReorganization of Aldrich and Murray\nSee the discussion in Note 18, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTrends and Economic Events\nWe are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors as well as geopolitical, environmental and social factors wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic diversity and the breadth of our products and services portfolios have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results.\nGiven our broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served, management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the Company. We monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. We regularly perform detailed evaluations of the different market segments we serve to proactively detect trends and to adapt our strategies accordingly, including potential triggers and actions to be taken under recessionary and other macroeconomic scenarios. In addition, we believe our backlog and order levels are indicative of future revenue and thus are a key measure of anticipated performance.\nConditions remain mixed across our served end markets and geographies. Overall Commercial HVAC markets in Americas and EMEA remain strong due to demand for our differentiated customer driven solutions and the benefits of installing energy efficient products and decarbonizing the built environment. In Asia, markets remain dynamic with mixed macro-economic conditions across the region. Transport refrigeration markets continue to experience weaker demand, particularly in the United States. Residential markets have weakened considerably throughout 2025 due to navigating a regulatory refrigerant transition, softer consumer demand and elevated channel inventory, while uncertainties remain from economic risks and higher interest rates.\nOur performance may be impacted by future developments that are uncertain. Geopolitical risks and macroeconomic developments, including changes in global trade policies, tariffs and other measures could cause disruptions to operations, supply chains, end markets, financial markets and overall economic conditions which could negatively impact our business.\nWe continue to monitor macroeconomic indicators and uncertainties resulting from the tariffs announced and implemented by the United States in 2025, as well as the tariffs imposed by other countries in response. These global trade policy changes continue to be dynamic, and as a result, we may experience supply chain challenges, commodity cost volatility, and consumer and economic uncertainty. We believe our business operating system, our in-region for region strategy, and strength in execution will enable us to navigate potential risks stemming from these recent events.\nWe believe we have a solid foundation of global brands that are highly differentiated in all of our major product lines. Our geographic mix, our diverse portfolio, and our large installed product base, provide growth opportunities from replacement demand and within our service revenue streams. Additionally, we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which we expect to drive future growth.\nResults of Operations\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe define organic revenue as net revenues adjusted for the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. Organic revenue is not defined under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered a substitute for revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP. Selected references are made to revenue growth on an organic basis so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impacts of fluctuations in foreign currency rates and acquisitions, thereby providing comparisons of operating performance from period to period of the business that we have owned during both periods presented. We believe organic revenue growth provides investors with useful supplemental information about our revenues in both periods presented.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring, non-cash adjustments for contingent consideration, merger and acquisition transaction costs, unallocated corporate expenses, discontinued operations and other non-recurring items. Segment Adjusted EBITDA, and ratios based on it, are used in the development of annual operating plans, including capital expenditure and operational budgets, and in measuring performance against targets for purposes of incentive compensation. Segment Adjusted EBITDA also provides a useful tool for assessing the operating performance and comparability between periods and our ability to generate cash because it excludes the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items that can vary significantly from period to period. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered a substitute for net earnings or other results as determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe operate under three reportable segments designed to create deep customer focus and relevance in markets around the world. Intercompany sales between segments are immaterial.\nOur Americas segment innovates for customers in North America and Latin America. The Americas segment encompasses commercial heating, cooling and ventilation systems, building controls and solutions, and energy services and solutions; residential heating and cooling; and transport refrigeration systems and solutions.\nOur EMEA segment innovates for customers in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The EMEA segment encompasses heating, cooling and ventilation systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings, and transport refrigeration systems and solutions.\nOur Asia Pacific segment innovates for customers throughout the Asia Pacific region. The Asia Pacific segment encompasses heating, cooling and ventilation systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings and transport refrigeration systems and solutions.\nThe following discussion compares our results for each of our three reportable segments for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues\nEMEA\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues\nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased by 4.2% or $188.4 million, compared with the same period of 2024.\nThe components of the period change were as follows:\nCurrency translation\nwas primarily driven by realization of price increases. Stronger volumes in our Commercial HVAC business were offset by weaker volumes in our Residential business.\nThe increase in revenue from acquisitions primarily relates to a channel acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2024 and acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2025.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased by 90 basis points to 23.1% compared to 22.2% for the same period in 2024 primarily due to price realization and gross productivity, partially offset by inflation and continued business reinvestment.\nEMEA\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased by 12.2% or $81.8 million, compared with the same period of 2024.\nThe components of the period change were as follows:\nCurrency translation\nwas driven by higher "
