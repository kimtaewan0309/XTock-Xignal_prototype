The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents or trade secrets. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.\nThe Company believes that its trademarks, patents, and trade secrets provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments.\nGovernment Regulation and Environmental Law Compliance\nThe Company’s business operations are subject to various governmental regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including, among others, those related to product liability; securities and corporate governance; antitrust and competition; intellectual property; environmental, health, and safety; tax; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; international import and export requirements and trade sanctions compliance; laws and regulations that apply to industries served by the Company, including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, and the Sunshine Act; and other matters.\n3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws and regulations around the world. The Company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies).\nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nIn 2024, 3M expended approximately $170 million (excluding activity related to the former Solventum health care business) on capital projects for environmental purposes as defined below. Capital projects for environmental purposes include waste reduction and pollution control programs such as water usage reduction and water quality improvement equipment, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers. Capital expenditures for similar projects are presently expected to approach approximately $340 million for 2025 and 2026 in aggregate.\nAlthough an estimate of certain nearer-term capital expenditures is provided above, 3M cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of compliance with government regulations (including environmental regulations) will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nFollowing is a list of the executive officers of 3M, and their age, present position, the year elected to their present position and other positions they have held during the past five years. No family relationships exist among any of the executive officers named, nor is there any undisclosed arrangement or understanding pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer.

Changes in such assumptions or factors could produce significantly different results.\n\n3M Company was incorporated in 1929 under the laws of the State of Delaware to continue operations begun in 1902. The Company’s ticker symbol is MMM. As used herein, the term “3M” or “Company” includes 3M Company and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. In this document, for any references to Note 1 through Note 23, refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nAvailable Information\n: 3M is a diversified technology company with a global presence in the following businesses\nSafety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is among the leading manufacturers of products for many of the markets it serves. Most 3M products involve expertise in product development, manufacturing and marketing, and are subject to competition from products manufactured and sold by other technologically oriented companies.\n: 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, and Consumer. 3M’s ",
  "item7_clean": "Cost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2024 when compared to 2023 and increased in 2023 when compared to 2022. Decreases in 2024 were primarily due to ongoing manufacturing productivity, procurement and logistics savings net of inflation, along with lower year-on-year restructuring charges. Increases in 2023 were primarily due to investments in growth, productivity and sustainability; restructuring charges, and carryover impact of higher energy cost inflation partially offset by lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending discipline, sourcing actions and restructuring benefits. See also\nCertain Expenses Impacting Multiple Line Items within Results of Operations\nsubsection further below.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSG&A, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2024 when compared to 2023 and increased in 2023 when compared to 2022. Decreases in 2024 were primarily impacted by a $10.3 billion pre-tax charge related to the PWS Settlement and the $4.2 billion pre-tax charge related to the CAE Settlement in the second and third quarters of 2023 respectively (both discussed in Note 19). SG&A in 2024 was also impacted by lower year-on-year restructuring charges. SG&A in 2023 was also impacted by restructuring charges (see Note 6), and continued investment in key growth initiatives. These impacts were partially offset by 2022 net costs for significant litigation to address Combat Arms Earplugs litigation matters (for which a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion was reflected in 2022, discussed in Note 19), certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia, divestiture-related restructuring charges (see Note 6), restructuring benefits and ongoing general 3M cost management. See also\nCertain Expenses Impacting Multiple Line Items within Results of Operations\nsubsection further below.\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. 3M is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes. Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\nThe Company considers the items below to be critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.\nAssessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain, and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 450,\n. Please refer to the section entitled\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings\nin Note 19) for additional information about such estimates.\nPension and Postretirement Obligations:\nThe Company applies certain estimates for the discount rates and expected return on plan assets in determining its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations and related net periodic benefit costs. The below further describes these estimates. Note 15 provides the weighted averages of these assumptions as of applicable dates and for respective periods and additional information on how the rates were determined.\nThe defined benefit pension and postretirement obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The annual measurement date is December 31. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. Changes in expected benefit payment and service cost cash flows, as well as ongoing changes in market activity and yields, cause these rates to be subject to uncertainty.\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\nInternational Pension\nPostretirement Benefits\nDecember 31, 2024 Liability:\n2024 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\nExpected return on plan assets\nThe expected return on plan assets for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2025 is 8.00%, an increase from the weighted average of 7.63% in 2024. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plans is 5.00% for 2025 compared to 5.31% for 2024. Changes in asset allocation and market performance over time, among other factors, cause these estimates to be subject to uncertainty.\nIn 2024 for continuing operations, the Company recognized pre-tax defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit service cost expense of $194 million and non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (including settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $828 million for a total pre-tax continuing operations defined benefit pension and postretirement expense of $1,022 million, up from $113 million in 2023. The 2024 amounts include the impacts of remeasurements of pension and postretirement pension plans during the year and $0.8 billion pension settlement charge associated the pension risk transfer special item (all discussed in Note 15).\nAssessments of Goodwill:\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgments in impairment assessments of goodwill. As of December 31, 2024, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $6.3 billion. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the goodwill would be impaired.\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples. 3M also performs a discounted cash flow analysis for certain reporting units if the market approach indicates additional review is warranted. A discounted cash flow analysis involves key assumptions including projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rates. Changes in reporting unit earnings, comparable company information, and expected future cash flows, as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions, among other factors, make these estimates subject to uncertainty.\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2024 completed as of October 1, 2024, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2024, 3M had 16 primary reporting units, with five reporting units accounting for approximately 85 percent of the goodwill. These five reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Commercial Branding and Transportation, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, and Personal Safety.\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses.\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2025 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\nUncertainty in Income Tax Positions:\nThe extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740,\n, a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 11 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nThe strength and stability of 3M’s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provide financial flexibility to deploy capital in accordance with the Company's stated priorities and meet needs associated with contractual commitments and other obligations. Investing in 3M’s business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 11 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2024, 3M owned 19.9% of Solventum Corporation common stock which ownership interest's fair value was $2.3 billion. As previously disclosed, 3M intends to divest its ownership in Solventum within five years from its April 2024 spin-off.\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Company’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.8 billion commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\nThe strength of 3M’s credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio , including scheduled maturities in the next 12 months as referenced in Note 14. As of the date of this report, 3M has a credit rating of A3, stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service, a credit rating of BBB+, negative outlook from S&P Global Ratings, and a credit rating of A-, stable outlook from Fitch.\nThe Company’s total debt associated with continuing operations at December 31, 2024 decreased when compared to December 31, 2023 as a result of $2.9 billion in debt maturities, consisting of $1.1 billion of medium-term notes and $1.8 billion repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Amounts borrowed by Solventum during the first quarter of 2024 were a liability associated with discontinued operations and, as transferred obligations, became the sole responsibility of Solventum after the April 1, 2024 Separation, as discussed in Note 14. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nEffective February 8, 2023, the Company renewed its “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. 3M also has a medium-term notes program (Series F) program, originally establishe",
