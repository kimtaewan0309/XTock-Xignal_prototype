  "item1_clean": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nDanaher is a global science and technology innovator committed to accelerating the power of science and technology to improve human health. Danaher is comprised of more than 15 operating companies with leadership positions in the biotechnology, life sciences and diagnostics sectors, organized under three segments (Biotechnology, Life Sciences and Diagnostics). United by the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (“DBS”), our businesses are also typically characterized by a high level of products and services that are sold on a recurring basis, primarily through a direct sales model and to a geographically diverse customer base. Our business’ research and development, manufacturing, sales, distribution, service and administrative facilities are located in more than 50 countries.\nDanaher strives to create shareholder value primarily through three strategic priorities:\nstrengthening our competitive advantage through consistent application of DBS tools and culture;\nenhancing our portfolio in attractive science and technology markets through strategic capital allocation; and\nconsistently attracting and retaining exceptional talent.\nDanaher measures its progress against these strategic priorities over the long-term based primarily on financial metrics relating to revenue growth, profitability, cash flow and capital returns, as well as certain non-financial metrics. To further the strategic objectives set forth above, the Company also acquires businesses and makes investments that either complement its existing business portfolio or expand its portfolio into new markets the Company deems attractive. Given the rapid pace of technological development and the specialized expertise typical of Danaher’s served markets, acquisitions as well as strategic alliances and investments can provide the Company access to important new technologies and domain expertise, and Danaher continues to pursue acquisition and investment opportunities within its targeted markets. The extent to which we identify, consummate and effectively integrate appropriate acquisitions and consummate appropriate investments affects our overall growth and operating results. Danaher also continually assesses the strategic fit of its existing businesses and may separate or otherwise dispose businesses based on strategic and other considerations.\nDBS is not only the set of business processes and tools our operating companies use on a daily basis in the pursuit of continuous improvement, but also represents our culture, which is guided by the following core values (the “Core Values”):\nCustomers Talk, We Listen\nKaizen is our Way of Life\nInnovation Defines our Future\nWe Compete for Shareholders\nUnderpinned by these five Core Values, the DBS tools are organized into four pillars that are designed to apply to every aspect of our business: Growth, Lean, Leadership and the DBS Fundamentals.\nThe idea for Danaher originated in the early 1980s when the Company’s founders, Steven M. and Mitchell P. Rales, envisioned a business that would generate sustainable long-term value for customers, associates and shareholders. Through a series of acquisitions and divestitures, Danaher has evolved over time into the science and technology innovator it is today. While the operating companies that make up Danaher have changed, DBS continues to be the guiding philosophy for the Company.\nSales in 2024 by geographic destination (geographic destination refers to the geographic area where the final sale to the Company’s unaffiliated customer is made) as a percentage of total 2024 sales were: North America, 43% (including 42% in the United States); Western Europe, 23%; other developed markets, 5%; and high-growth markets, 29%. The Company defines North America as the United States and Canada. The Company defines high-growth markets as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America (including Mexico) and Asia (with the exception of Japan, Australia and New Zealand).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide material information relevant to an assessment of Danaher’s financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. The MD&A is designed to focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. This includes descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations, as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management’s assessment to have a material impact on future operations. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:\nResults of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNew Accounting Standards\nUnless otherwise indicated, all financial results in this report refer to continuing operations.\nOVERVIEW\nRefer to “Item 1. Business—General” for a discussion of Danaher’s strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering long-term shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational business with global operations. During 2024, approximately 58% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic, political and geopolitical factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, help mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country, other than the United States, on its consolidated operating results. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.\nAs a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity and digitization) in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and regulatory changes. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and higher-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions and identify and consummate appropriate investments and strategic partnerships, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions and investments, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations.\nBusiness Performance\nConsolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 were flat and core sales decreased 1.5% as compared to 2023. Acquisitions contributed 2.0% to sales in 2024 compared to 2023, and were largely offset by core revenue declines led by the Biotechnology segment, and to a lesser extent the Life Sciences segment, partially offset by higher core sales in the Diagnostics segment. The impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 0.5% in 2024 compared to 2023. For the definition of “core sales” refer to “—Results of Operations” below.\nGeographically, the Company’s sales in developed markets in 2024 increased 2% compared to 2023 driven primarily by increased sales in North America. For the same period, core sales in developed markets were essentially flat, primarily due to increased core sales in North America offset by decreased core sales in Western Europe. Increased demand in the Diagnostics segment, offset by decreased demand in the Biotechnology and Life Sciences segments, contributed to the year-over-year flat core sales growth in developed markets. For the same period, sales in high-growth markets decreased year-over-year by 4% and core sales in high-growth markets decreased at a mid-single digit rate, due primarily to low double-digit core revenue declines in China. The decline in core sales in high-growth markets was primarily driven by lower demand across all segments, due to weakness in capital spending and generally lower underlying activity levels. High-growth markets represented approximately 29% of the Company’s total sales in 2024.\nThe Company’s net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $3.9 billion, compared to approximately $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net earnings attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $3.9 billion or $5.29 per diluted common share compared to approximately $4.7 billion or $6.38 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2023. 2024 intangible asset impairments and increased operating expenses, net of increased other income, drove the year-over-year decline in net earnings from continuing operations and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations. In addition to the above factors, net earnings from discontinued operations for 2024 compared with 2023 contributed to the lower net earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2024. Refer to “—Results of Operations” for further discussion of the year-over-year changes in net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. In response to current economic conditions, the Company expects to review and adjust its cost structure. In the first quarter of 2025, the Company commenced an initiative to identify productivity improvement and cost savings opportunities that we anticipate would generate annual pre-tax savings of at least $150 million. The Company expects these opportunities to be broad-based, including opportunities within China and the Diagnostics segment.\nDuring 2024, the Company acquired 3 businesses for total consideration of $558 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company’s Life Sciences segment. The Company preliminarily recorded an aggregate of $305 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions.\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the Company’s acquisitions.\nVeralto Corporation Separation\nOn September 30, 2023 (the “Distribution Date”), the Company completed the separation (the “Separation”) of its former Environmental & Applied Solutions business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Veralto Corporation (“Veralto”), the entity Danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. To effect the Separation, Danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of Veralto common stock for every three shares of Danaher common stock outstanding as of September 13, 2023, the record date for the distribution. Fractional shares of Veralto common stock that otherwise would have been distributed were aggregated and sold into the public market and the proceeds distributed to Danaher stockholders who otherwise would have received fractional shares of Veralto common stock.\nThe accounting requirements for reporting the Separation as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn this report, references to the non-GAAP measure of core sales (also referred to as core revenues or sales/revenues from existing businesses) refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding:\nsales from acquired businesses (as defined below); and\nthe impact of currency translation.\nReferences to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less any sales and operating profit, during the applicable period, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:\nthe period-to-period change in revenue (as defined above); and\nthe period-to-period change in revenue (as defined above) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.\nCore sales growth (decline) should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher’s peers. Management also uses this non-GAAP financial measure to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance and as one of the performance measures in the Company’s executive short-term cash incentive program. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from this measure because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.\nThroughout this discussion, references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.\nThe Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a given period.\nSales Growth (Decline) and Core Sales Decline\nTotal sales growth (decline) (GAAP)\nCurrency exchange rates\nCore sales decline (non-GAAP)\n2024 Sales Compared to 2023\nTotal sales were flat on a year-over-year basis in 2024 as sales from acquired businesses, which increased reported sales by 2.0%, were largely offset by a 1.5% decrease in core sales resulting from the factors discussed below by segment. The impact of changes in currency exchange rates decreased reported sales by 0.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2024 primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most other major currencies in 2024. Price increases contributed 1.0% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis and are reflected as a component of core sales decline above.\nOperating Profit Performance\nOperating profit margins decreased 140 basis points from 21.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023 to 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.\n2024 vs. 2023 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:\nThe incremental dilutive effect in 2024 of acquired businesses - 85 basis points\n2024 impairment charges related to a trade name in each of the Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments, net of 2023 impairment charges related to technology-based intangible assets in the Diagnostics segment and technology-based intangible assets and other assets in the Biotechnology segment. Refer to Note 10 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairments - 75 basis points\nFull year 2024 loss on the termination of a commercial arrangement in the Diagnostics segment - 25 basis points\n2023 gain from the resolution of a litigation contingency in the Life Sciences segment - 5 basis points\n2024 vs. 2023 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:\nAcquisition-related transaction costs deemed significant, settlement of pre-acquisition share-based payment awards and fair value adjustments to inventory in 2023, net of acquisition-related fair value adjustment to inventory in 2024, in each case related to the acquisition of Abcam plc (“Abcam”) - 30 basis points\nIncreased leverage and productivity in the Company’s operational and administrative cost structure, net of lower 2024 core sales and the impact of product mix - 20 basis points\nSales by business segment for the years ended December 31 are as follows ($ in millions):\n\nYear Ended December 31\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses\nSG&A as a % of sales\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased 180 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2024 compared with 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by $265 million of intangible asset impairment charges recorded in 2024 and the impact of recent acquisitions, including the associated amortization expenses, and the 2024 loss on the termination of a commercial arrangement of $56 million. These increases were partially offset by acquisition-related costs for the acquisition of Abcam of $87 million and intangible asset impairment charges of $64 million in 2023. Refer to Note 10 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairments.\nR&D expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales increased in 2024 as compared with 2023, primarily due to increased spending on R&D activities, including the impact of recent acquisitions.\nNONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE)\nNonoperating income (expense) consists primarily of net unrealized and realized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the Company’s investments in equity securities and investments in partnerships, the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs, gains on the sale of product lines and impairments of equity method investments. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nINTEREST COSTS\nInterest expense of $278 million for 2024 was $8 million lower than in 2023, due to lower balances on borrowings in 2024 compared to 2023, partially offset by higher average interest rates on the Company’s commercial paper borrowings. Interest income of $117 million for 2024 was $186 million lower than in 2023, due to lower average cash balances in 2024 primarily as a result of the use of cash for share repurchases and acquisitions.\nFor a further description of the Company’s debt and cross-currency swap derivative contracts related to the debt as of December 31, 2024 refer to Notes 13 and 14 to the ",
