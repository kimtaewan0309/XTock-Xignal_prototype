Our clinical research business offers comprehensive, integrated clinical development and analytical services including all phases of development (i.e., Phases I-IV), peri- and post-approval and site and patient access services.\nWe market and sell our products and services through a direct sales force, customer-service professionals, electronic commerce and third-party distributors. Our global team delivers a combination of innovative technologies, purchasing convenience and pharmaceutical services through our industry-leading brands, including Thermo Scientific, Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen, Fisher Scientific, Unity Lab Services, Patheon and PPD.\nWe have approximately 15,000 sales personnel including highly trained technical specialists who enable us to better meet the needs of our more technical end-users. We also provide customers with product standardization and other supply-chain-management services to reduce procurement costs.\nTHERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\nNew Products and Research and Development\nOur business includes the development and introduction of new products and may include entry into new business segments. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position.\nOur management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources. No single supplier is material, although for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design, certain materials components may be sourced from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such materials or components.\nRaw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions. We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results.\nPatents, Licenses and Trademarks\nPatents are important in many aspects of our business. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest. Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts.\nWe protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products. We also enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to intellectual property rights.\nRevenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Sales of seasonal products, such as allergy and flu tests and related diagnostic products, vary quarter to quarter and year to year.\nThe company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve. Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers, third-party distributors and service providers. Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development. Our success primarily depends on the following factors:\ntechnical performance and advances in technology that result in new products and improved price/performance ratios;\nproduct differentiation, availability and reliability;\nthe depth of our capabilities;\nour reputation among customers as a quality provider of products and services;\ncustomer service and support;\nactive research and application-development programs; and\nrelative prices of our products and services.\nTHERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\nGovernment Regulation\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countrie",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nReference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n, which begin on page\nof this report. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for 2022 is included in Item 7 of the company’s 2023\nThe company refers to various amounts or measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to their most directly comparable amount or measure under the section “\n” later in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 11): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services.\nConsolidated Results\n(Dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nGAAP operating income\nGAAP operating income margin\nAdjusted operating income\nAdjusted operating income margin\nGAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\nAdjusted earnings per share\nTHERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\nOrganic Revenue Growth\nImpact of acquisitions\nImpact of currency translation\nOrganic revenue growth\nSince 2020, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business have supported COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. Since the company’s acquisition of PPD in December 2021, the clinical research business has continued to play a leading role in supporting the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. These positive impacts continued at much lower levels in 2024 as customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand declined. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $0.10 billion and $0.33 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring 2024, all of our end markets were negatively impacted by a more muted macroeconomic environment and low economic activity in China. Revenues from pharma and biotech and diagnostics and healthcare customers were also negatively impacted by reduced demand for COVID-19 related products and services. As a result, revenues in these end markets declined slightly in the year. Revenues in the academic and government and industrial and applied markets increased slightly as we saw the benefits of our investments into high-impact innovation. During 2024, all geographies were negatively impacted by the more muted macroeconomic environment. Sales grew slightly in Asia-Pacific, including China. Sales growth in Europe was flat and sales in North America declined slightly due to decreased demand for COVID-19 related products. Contributions to organic revenue during 2024 from the Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments were offset by declines in the Life Sciences Solutions segment.\nThe company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars:\nHigh-impact innovation,\nOur trusted partner status with customers, and\nOur unparalleled commercial engine.\nGAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in 2024 due primarily to unfavorable business mix and strategic investments, partially offset by productivity improvements. The decreases in GAAP operating income margin during 2024 were more than offset by lower levels of amortization expense. We estimate that charges for restructuring and related actions incurred for headcount reductions and facility consolidations, which resulted in charges of approximately $0.3 billion in 2024 and $0.3 billion in 2023, will realize annual cost savings of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, primarily due to reduced employee and facility expenses.\nThe company’s references to strategic investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system to address inflation, including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.\nNotable Recent Acquisitions\nOn January 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the Specialty Diagnostics segment, The Binding Site Group, a U.K.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma.\nOn August 14, 2023, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, CorEvitas, LLC, a U.S.-based provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. The acquisition expands the segment’s portfolio with the addition of highly complementary real-world evidence solutions to enhance decision-making as well as the time and cost of drug development.\nOn July 10, 2024, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Olink Holding AB (publ), a Swedish-based provider of next-generation proteomics solutions. The acquisition enhances the segment’s capabilities in the high-growth proteomics market with the addition of highly differentiated solutions. It also complements the existing life sciences and mass\nTHERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\nspectrometry offerings, accelerating protein biomarker discovery and providing strong synergy opportunities.\nThe company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits as defined in Note 11. Accordingly, the following segment data are reported on this basis.\n(Dollars in millions)\nLife Sciences Solutions\nAnalytical Instruments\nSpecialty Diagnostics\nLaboratory Products and Biopharma Services\nConsolidated revenues\nLife Sciences Solutions\n(Dollars in millions)\nAcquisitions/ Divestitures\nSegment income margin\nThe decrease in organic revenues in 2024 was primarily due to moderation in COVID-19 related revenue. The increase in segment income margin resulted primarily from exceptionally strong productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments.\nAnalytical Instruments\n(Dollars in millions)\nAcquisitions/ Divestitures\nSegment income margin\nThe increase in organic revenues in 2024 was due to very strong growth in the electron microscopy business, partially offset by declines in the other instrumentation businesses. The decrease in segment income margin resulted primarily from unfavorable business mix and strategic investments, largely offset by strong productivity improvements.\nSpecialty Diagnostics\n(Dollars in millions)\nAcquisitions/ Divestitures\nSegment income margin\nThe increase in organic revenues in 2024 was driven by growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses, as well as in the healthcare market channel, partially offset by decreased demand for products addressing diagnosis of COVID-19. The increase in segment income margin was due to productivity improvements, partially offset by strategic investments.\nTHERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\nLaboratory Products and Biopharma Services\n(Dollars in millions)\nAcquisitions/ Divestitures\nSegment income margin\nOrganic revenues were flat in 2024 due to growth in the research and safety channel and clinical research business, offset by decreased demand in COVID-19 vaccines and therapies-related activity. The decrease in segment income margin was primarily due to unfavorable business mix and strategic investments, partially offset by productivity improvements.\n(Dollars in millions)\nNet interest expense\nGAAP other income/(expense)\nAdjusted other income/(expense)\nWeighted average diluted shares\nNet interest expense (interest expense less interest income) decreased due primarily to higher cash, and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances, as well as higher interest rates on these balances when compared to 2023. See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. In 2024 and 2023, the company’s net interest expense was reduced by approximately $264 million and $116 million, respectively, as a result of its interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements (Note 10).\nGAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains/losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities, and net periodic pension benefit cost/(income), excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in 2024 and 2023 also includes $20 million and $(45) million, respectively, of net gains/(losses) on investments.\nThe GAAP tax rate in 2024 was impacted by $176 million of expense, net, for a provision associated with a tax audit. The company’s 2024 GAAP and adjusted tax rates were also impacted by tax benefits of $459 million, primarily in jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized due to forecasted income.\nThe GAAP and adjusted tax rates in 2023 were impacted by changes in valuation allowances, including a $183 million release in a jurisdiction where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized, and, to a lesser extent, by a decrease in pre-tax earnings compared to 2022. The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates in 2023 were also impacted by tax planning initiatives, including a tax benefit of $127 million for U.S. tax credits and the revaluation of net operating loss carryforwards due to higher tax rates as a result of its tax return resubmissions, a tax benefit of $91 million, net of related tax expenses, from a foreign exchange loss on an intercompany debt refinancing transaction, and $233 million of tax benefits resulting from intra-entity transactions. The effective tax rates in both 2024 and 2023 were also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.\nThe company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2025 will be between 9% and 11% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be approximately 11.5% in 2025.\nThe company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income.\nEquity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities was impacted by an $88 million impairment of an equity method investment in 2024.\nTHERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\nWeighted average diluted shares decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to share repurchases, net of option dilution.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends.\nCash and cash equivalents\nShort-term investments\nApproximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable intercompany transactions, including loans and returns of capital, as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future.\nThe company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the company’s short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations totaled $2.21 billion. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 3). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit.\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2024, net income provided substantially all cash from operating activities. Changes in working capital were not significant. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.83 billion during 2024.\nDuring 2023, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. A decrease in inventories provided cash of $0.60 billion. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $0.50 billion, and changes in other assets and liabilities used cash of $0.80 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.48 billion during 2023.\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current ac",
