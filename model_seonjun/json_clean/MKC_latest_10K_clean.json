  "item1_clean": "In our flavor solutions segment, we provide a wide range of products to multinational food manufacturers and foodservice customers. The foodservice customers are supplied with branded, packaged products both directly by us and indirectly through distributors, with the exception of our businesses in China, where foodservice sales are managed by and reported in our consumer segment. We supply food manufacturers and foodservice customers with customized flavor solutions, and many of these customer relationships have been active for decades. Our range of flavor solutions remains one of the broadest in the industry and includes seasoning blends, spices and herbs, condiments, coating systems, and compound flavors. In addition to a broad range of flavor solutions, our long-standing customer relationships are evidence of our effectiveness in building customer\nintimacy. Our customers benefit from our expertise in many areas, including sensory testing, culinary research, food safety, and flavor application.\nOur flavor solutions segment has a number of competitors. Some tend to specialize in a particular range of products and have a limited geographic reach. Other competitors include large publicly held flavor companies that are more global in nature and tend to focus on providing integrated solutions extending beyond flavor through the use of other functional and nutritional ingredients.\nThe most significant raw materials used in our business are dairy products, pepper, onion, garlic, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), tomato products, sugar and salts. Pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the U.S. Other raw materials, like dairy products and onion, are primarily sourced locally, either within the U.S. or from our international locations. Because these raw materials are agricultural products, they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, including inflationary cost increases, and other factors beyond our control.\nWe respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, customer price adjustments, and cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. There has been, and there could continue to be, a difference between the timing of when these customer price adjustments and cost savings impact our results of operations and when the impact of cost inflation occurs. Additionally, in some instances, the pricing actions we take have been impacted by price elasticity which unfavorably impacts our sales volume and mix.\nIn addition, we rely on third-party transportation providers to deliver raw materials and our products to our customers. There has been, and could continue to be, reduced availability of transportation capacity due to labor shortages and higher fuel costs, which have caused and may continue to cause an increase in transportation costs for us and our suppliers.\nOur products are sold directly to customers as well as through brokers, wholesalers, and distributors. In the consumer segment, products are then sold to consumers under a number of brands through a variety of retail channels, including grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount and drug stores, and e-commerce. In the flavor solutions segment, products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients in their finished goods and by foodservice customers for menu items, as well as provided to their own customers for dine-in and take-out occasions, all to enhance the flavor of their foods. Customers in the flavor solutions segment include food manufacturers and the foodservice industry, supplied through a variety of channels, including directly and indirectly through distributors, wholesale foodservice suppliers, and e-commerce.\nWe have a large number of customers for our products. Sales to one of our consumer segment customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for consolidated sales of approximately 12% in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Sales to one of our flavor solutions segment customers, PepsiCo, Inc., accounted for consolidated sales of approximately 13% in 2024, 13% in 2023, and 11% in 2022. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, the top three customers in our flavor solutions segment represented between 47% and 49% of our global flavor solutions sales.\nTrademarks, Licenses and Patents\nWe own a number of trademark registrations. Although in the aggregate these trademarks are material to our business, the loss of any one of those trademarks, with the exception of our “McCormick,” “French’s,” “Frank’s RedHot,” “Lawry’s,” “Zatarain’s,” “Cholula,” “Stubb's,” “Club House,” “Ducros,” “Schwartz,” “Vahiné,” \"OLD BAY,\" \"Simply Asia,\" \"Thai Kitchen,\" “Kamis,” “La Drogheria,” \"DaQiao,\" and \"Gourmet Garden\" trademarks, would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The “Mc – McCormick” trademark is extensively used in connection with the sale of our food products in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. markets. The terms of the trademark registrations are prescribed by law, and the registrations will be renewed as long as we deem them useful.\nWe have entered into a number of license agreements authorizing the use of our trademarks by affiliated and non-affiliated entities. The loss of these license agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The term of the license agreements is generally two-to-three years or until such time as either party terminates the agreement. Those agreements with specific terms may be renewable upon agreement of the parties.\nWe also own various patents, none of which are individually material to our business.\nDue to seasonal factors inherent in the business, our sales, operating income, and cash from operations are generally higher in the fourth quarter because of the holiday season. This seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns, primarily in the consumer segment.\nIn order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter, we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year. We generally finance working capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of our liquidity and capital resources, see Note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements and the “Liquidity and Financial Condition” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis.”\nEach segment operates in highly competitive markets around the world. In this environment, our growth strategies include customer engagement and product innovation based on consumer insights. In the consumer segment, we are building brand recognition and loyalty through advertising and promotions. In our flavor solutions segment, we differentiate ourselves through culinary and consumer-inspired flavor development, as well as the breadth of our product offering and customer engagement.\nGovernmental Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world that apply to our global businesses. In the U.S., the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling, and sale of many of our products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; anti-corruption laws; customs and trade laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; privacy laws; federal, state, and local environmental protection laws; and other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Outside the U.S., our business is subject to numerous similar statutes, laws, and regulatory requirements.\nWe believe in the power of people—fostering a culture for our employees that embodies respect and collaboration across the organization. Our high-performance culture is rooted in shared values and respect for all contributions of every employee. Our key human capital objectives are to attract, retain, and develop the highest quality talent. We employ various human resource programs in support of these objectives. We believe diversity, equity, and inclusion are at the core of our values and strategic business priorities. Throughout our business, we champion equality, supporting parity for women and under-represented groups, as we work to create ethical, safe, and supportive workplaces where our employees thrive. We believe a diverse and inclusive workplace results in business growth and encourages increased innovation, retention of talent, and a more engaged workforce. We have various employee ambassador groups that provide a supportive and collaborative space for employees to come together and promote inclusion. We prioritize the mental health and wellness of our employees by offering and encouraging participation in various programs and initiatives. Respect for human rights is fundamental to our business and its commitment to ethical conduct.\nWe had approximately 14,100 full-time employees worldwide as of November 30, 2024. Our operations have not been affected significantly by work stoppages, and, in the opinion of management, employee relations are good. We have approximately 400 employees in the U.S. who are covered by a collective bargaining contract. At our subsidiaries outside the U.S., approximately 2,500 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements.\nThrough our continuous listening strategy, we measure employee engagement on an ongoing basis to solicit feedback and understand the views of our employees, work environment, and culture. The results from these surveys are used to implement programs and processes designed to enhance employee engagement and improve the overall employee experience.\nWe are committed to the safety, health, and security of our employees. We believe a hazard-free environment is a critical enabler for the success of our business. Throughout our operations, we strive to ensure that all of our employees have access to safe workplaces that allow them to succeed in their jobs.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nIn addition to the executive officers indicated in the 2025 Proxy Statement incorporated by reference in Part III, Item 10 of this Report, the other executive officers of McCormick are Marcos M. Gabriel, Katherine A. Jenkins, and Ana G. Sanchez.\nMr. Gabriel is 53 years old and, during the last five years has held the following positions within McCormick: December 2024 to present - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; March 2024 to November 2024 - Senior Vice President Global Finance and Capital Markets; June 2023 to February 2024 - Senior Vice President, Finance and Global Business Services; August 2022 to May 2023 - Chief Transformation Officer; and August 2017 to July 2020 - Chief Financial Officer Americas.\nMs. Jenkins is 56 years old and, during the last five years, has held the following positions with McCormick: June 2023 to present - Chief Growth Officer; June 2022 to May 2023 – Chief Strategy Officer & Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and January 2017 to June 2022, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMs. Sanchez is 49 years old and, during the last five years, has held the following positions with McCormick: February 2022 to present - President, EMEA; February 2020 to January 2022 – Vice President Consumer, EMEA, and November 2018 to January 2020 – Vice President Marketing, EMEA.\nOperations Outside of the U.S.\nWe are subject in varying degrees to certain risks typically associated with a global business, such as local economic and market conditions, exchange rate fluctuations, and restrictions on investments, royalties, and dividends. In fiscal year 2024, approximately 39% of sales were from non-U.S. operations. For information on how",
  "item7_clean": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand McCormick & Company, Incorporated, our operations, and our present business environment from the perspective of management. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. We use certain non-GAAP information—more fully described below under the caption Non-GAAP Financial Measures—that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. The dollar and share information in the charts and tables in MD&A are in millions, except per share data.\nMcCormick is a global leader in flavor. We manufacture, market, and distribute spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food and beverage industry–retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We manage our business in two operating segments, consumer and flavor solutions, as described in Item 1 of this report.\nOur long-term annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4% to 6%, increase adjusted operating income 7% to 9% and increase adjusted earnings per share 9% to 11%. Our actual annual results can vary from our long-term growth objectives.\nOver time, we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from: 1) our base business – driven by brand marketing support, category management, and differentiated customer engagement; 2) new products; and 3) acquisitions.\n– We expect to drive sales growth by optimizing our brand marketing investment through improved speed, quality, and effectiveness. We measure the return on our brand marketing investment and identify digital marketing as one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support. Through digital marketing, we are connecting with consumers in a personalized way to deliver recipes, provide cooking advice, and help them discover new products.\n– For our consumer segment, we believe that scalable and differentiated innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from our competition, including private label. We are introducing products for every type of cooking occasion, from gourmet, premium items to convenient and value-priced flavors.\nFor flavor solutions customers, we are developing seasonings for snacks and other food products, as well as flavors for new menu items. We have a strong pipeline of flavor solutions products aligned with our customers’ new product launch plans, many of which include clean-label, organic, natural, and “better-for-you” innovation. With over 20\nproduct innovation centers around the world, we are supporting the growth of our brands and those of our flavor solutions customers with products that appeal to local consumers.\n– Acquisitions are expected to approximate one-third of our sales growth over time. We focus on acquisition opportunities that meet the growing demand for flavor and health. Geographically, our focus is on acquisitions that build scale where we currently have presence in both developed and emerging markets.\nIn 2024, we achieved net sales growth of 0.9% over the 2023 level due to the following factors:\nVolume and product mix favorably impacted our net sales growth by 0.3%, exclusive of divestitures. The consumer segment experienced favorable volume and product mix of 0.8% and the flavor solutions segment experienced unfavorable volume and product mix of 0.3%.\nPricing actions contributed 0.5% to the increase in net sales, driven by the favorable impact of pricing actions in our flavor solutions segment.\nDivestitures negatively impacted our net sales by 0.2%.\nNet sales were favorably impacted by fluctuations in currency rates by 0.3%.\nExcluding the impact of divestitures and fluctuations in currency rates, we grew sales, on an organic basis, by 0.8% over the prior year.\nOperating income was $1,060.3 million in 2024 and $963.0 million in 2023. We recognized $9.5 million and $61.2 million of special charges in 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to organization and streamlining actions. In 2024, operating income was positively impacted by the higher level of sales and an improvement in our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales of 90 basis points as compared to the prior year. The gross profit margin improvement was driven by the effects of favorable pricing actions, favorable product and customer mix, less scrapped inventory, and cost savings led by our CCI and Global Operating Effectiveness (GOE) programs which were partially offset by higher conversion costs, all as compared to the prior year. A higher level of SG&A expenses resulted in a 40 basis point increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales with approximately half of that basis point increase attributable to an increase in advertising and promotion spend. In addition, the higher level of SG&A expenses was driven by increased selling and marketing costs and a higher level of research and development expenses that were partially offset by, lower performance-based employee and stock based compensation expense and cost savings led by our CCI and GOE programs, all as compared to the prior year. Excluding special charges, adjusted operating income was $1,069.8 million in 2024, representing a 4.5% increase compared to $1,024.2 million in 2023. In constant currency, adjusted operating income increased 4.6%. For further details and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to reported amounts, see the subsequent discussion under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nDiluted earnings per share was $2.92 in 2024 and $2.52 in 2023. In 2024, diluted earnings per share growth was driven primarily by higher operating income, which included the effects of lower special charges, an increase in income from unconsolidated operations and a decrease in the effective tax rate. Special charges lowered earnings per share by $0.03 and $0.18 in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the effects of special charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.95 in 2024, compared to $2.70 in 2023, representing an increase of 9.3%.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $921.9 million, $1,237.3 million, and $651.5 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In 2024, we continued to have a balanced use of cash for debt repayment, capital expenditures, and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends, with annual increases in each of the past 39 years, and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. In 2024, the return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was $504.1 million.\nIn 2025, we expect net sales to grow between 0% and 2% compared to our 2024 net sales, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates, or to grow from 1% to 3% on an organic basis. We anticipate that sales in 2025 will benefit from favorable volume and product mix.\nWe expect our 2025 gross profit margin to improve by 50 to 100 basis points from the 38.5% gross profit margin reported in 2024. This projected increase is primarily driven by (i) positive effects from product mix changes, (ii) anticipated cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program, and (iii) a low single-digit percentage impact of inflation in 2025 compared to 2024.\nFor 2025, we anticipate an increase in operating income of 3% to 5% over the 2024 level, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates. This anticipated increase in operating income reflects the expected rise in our gross profit margin and SG&A cost savings from our CCI program, although these will be partially offset by investments aimed at driving volume growth, particularly in brand marketing. We project our brand marketing investments in 2025 to rise by high-single digits compared to 2024. Additionally, we expect approximately $15 million in special charges related to previously announced organizational and streamlining actions; in 2024, special charges totaled $9.5 million. Excluding these special charges, we expect adjusted operating income in 2025 to increase by 3% to 5%, which includes a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates, or to increase by 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis.\nWe estimate that our 2025 effective tax rate, including the net favorable impact of anticipated discrete tax items, although at a lower amount than in 2024, will be 22.0% as compared to 20.5% in 2024. Excluding projected taxes associated with special charges, we estimate that our adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 22.0% in 2025, as compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 20.5% in 2024.\nWe also expect that our income from unconsolidated operations, including the performance of our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, will decline by a mid-teen percentage rate from the 2024 level, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso.\nDiluted earnings per share was $2.92 in 2024. Diluted earnings per share for 2025 is projected to range from $2.99 to $3.04. Excluding the per share impact of special charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.95 in 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding an estimated per share impact from special charges of $0.04, is projected to range from $3.03 to $3.08 in 2025. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to increase by 3% to 5%, which includes a 2% unfavorable impact from currency rates, or to increase by 5% to 7% on a constant currency basis over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.95 in 2024.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2024 COMPARED TO 2023\nComponents of percent growth in net sales\nincrease (decrease):\nVolume and product mix\nSales for 2024 increased by 0.9% from 2023 and by 0.8% on an organic basis (that is, excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign currency exchange as more fully described under the caption, Non-GAAP Financial Measures). Pricing actions, primarily implemented during the prior year, increased sales by 0.5% as compared to 2023. Favorable volume and product mix increased sales by 0.3%. The divestiture of our Giotti canning business unfavorably impacted sales by 0.2% as compared to the prior year. Sales were impacted by favorable foreign currency rates that increased sales by 0.3% in 2024 as compared to the prior year. Excluding divestitures and the impact of foreign currency rates, our organic sales growth was 0.8%, as compared to 2023.\nIn 2024, gross profit increased by $88.5 million, or 3.5%, from 2023. Our gross profit margin for 2024 was 38.5%, an increase of 90 basis points from 37.6% in 2023. The increase was driven by the favorable impact of our pricing actions, favorable product and customer mix, less scrapped inventory and cost savings led by our CCI and GOE programs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher conversion costs, as compared to 2023.\nSelling, general & administrative expense\nPercent of net sales\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased by $42.9 million in 2024 as compared to 2023. That increase in SG&A expense was primarily a result of increased advertising and promotional spend, increased selling and marketing costs and a higher level of research and development expenses which were partially offset by lower performance-based employee and stock-based compensation expense, all as compared to 2023. SG&A as a percent of net sales for 2024 increased by 40 basis points from the prior year level, as the net impact of the previously mentioned factors was partially offset by the impact of the higher sales base.\nTotal special charges\nWe regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness, and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future. From time to time, those changes are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/ structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our Management Committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements.\nDuring 2024, we recorded $9.5 million of special charges, consisting principally of $4.5 million associated with the GOE program and $5.0 million associated with the transition of a manufacturing facility in EMEA.\nDuring 2023, we recorded $61.2 million of special charges, consisting principally of $42.8 million associated with the GOE program, $8.7 million associated with the transition of a manufacturing facility in EMEA, and streamlining actions of $8.8 million in the Americas region and $0.9 million in the EMEA region.\nDetails with respect to the composition of special charges are included in the accompanying notes to our financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nPercent of net sales\nOperating income increased by $97.3 million, or 10.1%, from $963.0 million in 2023 to $1,060.3 million in 2024. Special charges decreased by $51.7 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, positively impacting operating income. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased by 130 basis points in 2024, to 15.8% in 2024 from 14.5% in 2023 as a result of the factors previously described. Excluding the effect of special charges, adjusted operating income was $1,069.8 million in 2024 as compared to $1,024.2 million in 2023, an increase of $45.6 million or 4.5% from the 2023 level. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales increased by 50 basis points in 2024, to 15.9% in 2024 from 15.4% in 2023.\nInterest expense was $1.2 million higher in 2024 as compared to the prior year, as a reduction in average borrowing levels was more than offset by the effects of higher interest rates on borrowings. Other income increased $3.5 million as compared to the prior period, driven by an increase in interest income, partially offset by a higher level of foreign currency exchange losses.\nIncome from consolidated operations before income taxes\nThe effective tax rate for 2024 was 20.5%, compared to 21.8% in 2023. This reduction in our effective tax rate is primarily due to a higher level of net discrete tax benefits recorded for 2024. Specifically, net discrete tax benefits amounted to $31.7 million in 2024, an increase of $22.1 million from $9.6 million in 2023.\nThe $31.7 million of net discrete tax benefits for 2024 principally included (i) $19.4 million of tax benefits associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to an international legal entity reorganization, (ii) $12.3 million of tax benefit from the reversal of certain reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest associated with both the effective settlement from the conclusion of a tax examination and the expiration of statutes of limitations, (iii) $6.0 million of tax benefits resulting from state tax matters, and related deferred taxes, (iv) $1.8 million of tax benefit from an adjustment to a prior year tax accrual and related deferred taxes based on final returns filed, (v) $6.2 million of tax expense associated with the adjustment of valuation allowances due to changes in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets, and (vi) $1.8 million of tax expense related to certain unremitted prior year earnings.\nThe $9.6 million of net discrete tax benefits for 2023 principally included (i) $5.6 million of tax benefit from the reversal of certain reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest associated with both the settlement and the expiration of statu",
