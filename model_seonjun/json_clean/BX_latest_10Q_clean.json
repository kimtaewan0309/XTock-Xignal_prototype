Certain of our open-ended vehicles generally afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually, quarterly or monthly), typically with 2 to 95 days’ notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. In our perpetual capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, redemption requests are required to be fulfilled only (a) in Blackstone’s or the vehicles’ board’s discretion, as applicable, (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital, or (c) where such required redemptions are limited in quantum, such as interval funds or in certain insurance-dedicated vehicles. Investment advisory agreements related to certain SMAs in our Credit & Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing segments, excluding SMAs in our insurance platform, may generally be terminated by an investor on 15 to 95 days’ notice. SMAs in our insurance platform can generally only be terminated for long-term underperformance, cause and certain other limited circumstances, in each case subject to Blackstone’s right to cure.\n\nThe results of all valuations of investments held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles are reviewed by the relevant business unit’s valuation\nwhich is comprised of key personnel from the business unit, typically the chief investment officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer (or their respective equivalents where applicable) and other senior managing directors in the business. To further corroborate results, each business unit also generally obtains either a positive assurance opinion or a range of value from an independent valuation party, at least annually for internally prepared valuations for investments that have been held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles for greater than a year and quarterly for certain investments. Our firmwide valuation committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and comprised of senior members of our businesses and representatives from corporate functions, including legal and finance, reviews the valuation process for investments held by us and our investment vehicles, including the application of appropriate valuation standards on a consistent basis. Each quarter, the valuation process is also reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of our\n\nThe fair value of the investments held by Blackstone Funds is the primary input to the calculation of certain of our management fees, Incentive Fees, Performance Allocations and the related Compensation we recognize. Generally, Blackstone Funds are accounted for in accordance with the GAAP guidance on investment companies, and under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies, and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments, at fair value. In the absence of observable market prices, we utilize valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis and assumptions that we believe market participants would use to determine the fair value of the investments. For investments where little market activity exists management’s determination of fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances, which may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, and the consideration of a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for\nand liquidity risks.\n\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was signed into law. The OBBBA provides for significant U.S. tax law changes including making permanent key elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including 100% bonus depreciation, domestic research cost expensing, and the business interest expense limitation. Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, these provisions were set to sunset on December 31, 2025. Blackstone does not believe the extension of these provisions, or other provisions contained in the OBBBA, will materially impact its financial statements. For further discussion of potential consequences of changes in tax regulations, please see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Changes in U.S. and foreign taxation of businesses and other tax laws, regulations or treaties or an adverse interpretation of these items by tax authorities could adversely affect us, including by adversely impacting our effective tax rate and tax liability.” in our Annual Report on\nfor the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nThe U.S. federal government shutdown effective October 1, 2025 has resulted in the unavailability of certain economic data for the third quarter of 2025, including GDP, labor market and personal consumption expenditures index data. Among the available data, the September Consumer Price Index was up 3.0% year-over-year and 0.3% from August, putting annual inflation at a rate of 3.0%. Although this represents a significant moderation of inflation compared to recent years, the overall rate has remained steadily above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2.0%. The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target range by 25 basis points in September 2025, followed by an additional 25 basis points to\nsubsequent to quarter end in October 2025, the lowest level in three years. The\nU.S. Treasury yield decreased 8 basis points in the quarter to 4.15% and further declined following quarter end to 4.08% as of October 31, 2025. Three-month SOFR decreased 21 basis points in the quarter to 4.24%.\n\nWe may, under certain circumstances, use leverage opportunistically and over time to create the most efficient capital structure for Blackstone and our stockholders. In addition to the borrowings from our notes issuances and our Revolving Credit Facility, we may use asset based financing arrangements, including but not limited to margin loans, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased. Reverse repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to take advantage of opportunistic yields otherwise absent in the overnight markets and also to use the collateral received to cover securities sold, not yet purchased. Repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to opportunistically yield higher spreads on purchased securities. The balances held in these financial instruments fluctuate based on Blackstone’s liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles.\n\nIn addition to the cash we receive from our notes offerings and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and other borrowings, we expect to receive (a) cash generated from operating activities, (b) Performance Revenue realizations, and (c) realizations on the fund investments that we make. The amounts received from these three sources in particular may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the frequency and size of realization events or net returns experienced by our investment funds. Our available capital could be adversely affected if there are prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls for new investments from those investment funds. Therefore, Blackstone’s commitments to our funds are taken into consideration when managing our overall liquidity and cash position.\n\nMost major equity markets appreciated in the third quarter of 2025, driven by positive economic data, accommodative central bank actions, and growing optimism over easing trade tensions. The S&P 500 Index delivered a total return of 8.1%, led by the information technology and telecommunications sectors, which gained 13.2% and 12.0%, respectively. The consumer staples sector, however, was the worst performing sector, declining 2.4%. Equity market volatility declined, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declining 2.7% from the second quarter of 2025. In credit markets, the S&P Leveraged Loan Index generated a total return of 1.8% and the ICE Bank of America High Yield Bond Index returned 2.4%. High yield spreads tightened by 23 basis points, while\nissuance increased 9.6% year-over-year.\n\nOther Operating Expenses is presented on a segment basis and is equal to General, Administrative and Other Expenses, adjusted to (a) remove transaction-related and\nitems that arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and\ngains, losses or other charges, if any, (b) remove certain expenses reimbursed by the Blackstone Funds which are netted against Management and Advisory Fees, Net in Blackstone’s segment presentation and (c) give effect to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. The administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under GAAP, but is reflected as a reduction of Other Operating Expenses in Blackstone’s segment presentation.\n\nExpenses were $1.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $145.4 million, compared to $1.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $209.6 million in Total Compensation and Benefits, of which $311.6 million was a decrease in Performance Allocations Compensation, partially offset by an increase of $113.6 million in Compensation. The decrease in Performance Allocations Compensation was primarily attributable to the decrease in Investment Income (Loss), on which a portion of Performance Allocations Compensation is based. The increase in Compensation was primarily attributable to the increase in Management and Advisory Fees, Net, on which a portion of Compensation is based.\n\nBXMA is organized into four investment platforms: Absolute Return, Multi-Strategy, Total Portfolio Ma"
