Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our\nForward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company are based on our knowledge of our business and the environment in which we operate, but because of the factors listed above or other factors, actual results could differ materially from those reflected by any forward-looking statements. Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made are qualified by these cautionary statements and those contained in the Company’s\nSeasonality and Weather\nOur business is seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. We usually experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season, and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the cold weather selling season. We believe that our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the performance of the halves, not the quarters, due to the fact that different weather patterns from year-to-year can shift the timing of sales and profits between quarters, particularly between the first and second fiscal quarters and the third and fourth fiscal quarters.\nHistorically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have unfavorably affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations. In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain, and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively, depending on the severity and length of these conditions. Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully execute this strategy. For more information regarding the risks we face in this regard, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Weather and Climate Risks” in our\n\nComparable Store Metrics\nComparable store metrics are a key performance indicator used in the retail industry and by the Company to measure the performance of the underlying business. Our comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales and exclude certain adjustments to net sales. Stores closed during either of the years being compared are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations. Stores relocated during either of the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics calculations. If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics calculations became material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations. Allivet sales will be considered comparable store sales one year after the transaction close date of December 30, 2024. Comparable store sales are intended only as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nTransaction Count and Transaction Value\nTransaction count and transaction value metrics are used by the Company to measure sales performance. Transaction count represents the number of customer transactions during a given period. Transaction value represents the average amount paid per transaction and is calculated as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions during a given period.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales.\nFor the Fiscal Three\nCost of merchandise sold\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nDepreciation and amortization\nInterest expense, net\nIncome before income taxes\nNote: Percentage of net sales amounts may not sum to totals due to rounding.\nFiscal Three Months (Third Quarter) Ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024\nNet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 7.2% to $3.72 billion from $3.47 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by the 3.9% increase in comparable store sales, as well as new store openings and the contribution from Allivet. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, net sales increased 1.6% and comparable store sales decreased 0.2%.\nThe comparable store sales results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 included a comparable average transaction count increase of 2.7% and a comparable average ticket increase of 1.2%. Comparable store sales growth was driven by strength in spring and summer seasonal products and continued momentum in core categories, especially consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products.\n\nFiscal Three Months Ended\nLivestock, Equine & Agriculture\nSeasonal & Recreation\nTruck, Tool & Hardware\nClothing, Gift & Décor\nGross profit increased 7.7% to $1.39 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 from $1.29 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, gross margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 15 basis points to 37.4% from 37.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Gross margin improvement from the Company’s ongoing focus on product cost management and the continued execution of an everyday low price strategy was primarily offset by tariff costs and higher transportation costs.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 8.4% to $1.05 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 from $965.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 29 basis points to 28.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 from 27.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to planned investments, as well as the timing of higher incentive compensation as the Company lapped lower accruals in the prior year and a lower sale-leaseback benefit. These factors were partially offset by an ongoing focus on productivity and fixed cost leverage.\nOperating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 5.6% to $342.7 million from $324.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nDuring the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends:\nPer Share of Common Stock\n(a) All share and per share information has been adjusted to reflect the five-for-one Stock Split effective December 20, 2024.\nIt is the present intention of the Company’s Board of Directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition, and capital needs of the Company, along with any other factors that the Company’s Board of Directors deem relevant.\nOn November 5, 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 9, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 24, 2025.\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program which was announced in February 2007. The aggregate total authorized amount of the program, which was increased by $1.00 billion on February 12, 2025, is currently $7.50 billion, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. The program may be limited, temporarily paused, or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of September 27, 2025, the Company had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $1.24 billion, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.\nThe following table provides the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share, and total cost of share repurchases pursuant to our publicly announced repurchase plan during the fiscal three and nine months ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nFiscal Three Months Ended\nFiscal Nine Months Ended\nTotal number of shares repurchased\nAverage price paid per share\nTotal cost of share repurchases\n(a) All share and per share information has been adjusted to reflect the five-for-one Stock Split effective December 20, 2024.\n(b) Effective January 1, 2023, the Company’s share repurchases are subject to a 1% excise tax as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Excise taxes incurred on share repurchases represent direct costs of the repurchase and are recorded as a part of the cost basis of the shares within treasury stock. The cost of shares repurchased may differ from the repurchases of common stock amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to unsettled share repurchases at the end of a period and excise taxes incurred on share repurchases.\n\nSales from new stores, including Allivet sales, were $113.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, which represented 3.3 percentage po"
