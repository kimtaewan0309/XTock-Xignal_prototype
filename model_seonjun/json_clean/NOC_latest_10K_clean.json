  "item7_clean": "Due to the applicable FAR and CAS requirements that govern our U.S. government business, most types of costs are allocable to U.S. government contracts. As such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor, subcontractor, material, overhead and general and administrative (G&A) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.\nIn evaluating our operating performance, we primarily focus on changes in sales and operating margin rates. Where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. Based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services. Changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in operating margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and/or contract mix. For purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels and performance generally refers to non-volume-related changes in profitability, which are typically described in terms of changes in net EAC adjustments. Contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment).\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS\nFor purposes of the operating results discussion below, we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” or “FAS”).\nMark-to-market adjusted net earnings (MTM-adjusted net earnings) and MTM-adjusted earnings per share (MTM-adjusted EPS) exclude MTM pension and OPB benefit/(expense) and related tax impacts, which are generally only recognized during the fourth quarter. These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. These measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of MTM accounting is not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards.\nWe reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. These non-GAAP measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nSelected financial highlights are presented in the table below:\n\nWe also consider the impact of macroeconomic factors on our estimates, in particular on contract EACs that span several years. For example, we have included in our EACs management’s best estimate of the impact inflation and disruptions in the supply chain have had and may continue to have on our contracts. Although the overall financial impact these macroeconomic factors have had on our company has largely subsided, volatility of the recent macroeconomic environment has added complexity to our estimation process and may result in our contract EACs having more variability in the future than they might otherwise have had if the estimates had been prepared in a more stable macroeconomic environment.\nWe generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. These assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by any number of these factors over time, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those estimates as facts and circumstances change or become known to us.\nThe company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. Cost estimates on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than on mature, full-rate production contracts. As a result, there is typically more variability in those estimates and greater financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts. Changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and G&A costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. Identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. Similarly, the changes in estimates may include changes in, or resolution of, identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.\nFor the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, see “Segment Operating Results” and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n– The determination of projected benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and pension and OPB expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. We perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. When we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and OPB expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease materially. The principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and OPB plans. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions (i.e., actuarial gains or losses) are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.\n– The discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and OPB obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated AA or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 5.73 percent at December 31, 2024 and 5.15 percent at December 31, 2023.\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n\nSee “Segment Operating Results” below for further information by segment and “Product and Service Analysis” for product and service detail. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments.\nOperating Income and Margin Rate\n2024 operating income increased $1.8 billion, or 72 percent, primarily due to higher operating income at Aeronautics Systems, largely driven by the prior year $1.56 billion charge on the B-21 program, as well as higher operating income at Space Systems and Defense Systems. 2024 operating income also increased due to a $122 million increase in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, partially offset by $73 million of higher unallocated corporate expense, largely due to a $127 million increase in deferred state taxes related to the MTM benefit (expense) and prior year B-21 charge and $25 million of lower intangible amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation. 2024 operating margin rate increased to 10.6 percent from 6.5 percent reflecting the items above.\n2024 G&A costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 9.7 percent from 10.2 percent primarily due to higher sales.\nFor further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses, see “Product and Service Analysis” below.\nMark-to-Market Pension and OPB Benefit/Expense\nThe primary components of pre-tax MTM benefit (expense) are presented in the table below:\n\n2024 diluted earnings per share increased $14.81, or 109 percent, reflecting the 103 percent increase in net earnings described above and a 3 percent reduction in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nSEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS\nBasis of Presentation\nThe company is aligned in four operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems.\nEffective July 1, 2024, the company realigned the Strategic Deterrent Systems (SDS) division, which includes the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (“Sentinel”) program, from Space Systems to Defense Systems. This realignment is reflected in the financial information contained in this report.\nSubsequent Realignment\n- Effective January 1, 2025, the company realigned the Strike and Surveillance Aircraft Solutions (SSAS) business unit from Defense Systems to Aeronautics Systems. This realignment is not reflected in the financial information contained in this report; it will be reflected in the company’s operating results beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\nFor a more complete description of each segment’s products and services, see “Business.”\nSegment Operating Income and Margin Rate\nSegment operating income, as reconciled in the table below, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) are non-GAAP measures that reflect the combined operating income of our four segments less the operating income associated with intersegment sales. Segment operating income includes pension expense allocated to our sectors under FAR and CAS and excludes FAS pension service expense and unallocated corporate items (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable FAR and CAS requirements, and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance). These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. These measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n\nthan anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology. As we expect to recover a significant portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts, such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets (current portion) and other non-current assets until charged to contracts. We use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs, assessing, among other things, U.S. government regulations, our U.S. government contract mix and past practices. Portions of the company’s environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed. As of December 31, 2024, we expect approximately 93 percent of the company’s environmental remediation costs to be recoverable; however, to the extent our judgments on the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs change or the unallowable portion of our environmental remediation costs otherwise increase, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\n– The evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, requires the use of judgment. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable, there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. The company follows a recognition and measurement approach, considering the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. We exercise judgment in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support our assessment using all available information. The technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position. In measuring the tax position, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. When it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. As of December 31, 2024, we have approximately $1.4 billion in unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\nFor further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see “Risk Factors” and Note 1, Note 6, Note 10 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets\n– We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.\nWe record property, plant and equipment (PP&E) for capital assets used in operating our business. The cost of PP&E utilized in support of our government contracts is generally allowable and allocable cost in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements, which limits our risk of impairment on those assets. However, the cost of PP&E utilized in support of our commercial business, including approximately $575 million of PP&E used in our commercial space business, is not allocable to government contracts and is therefore subject to greater recoverability risk.\n– We test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments",
