Global enterprises, service providers and business ecosystems of industry partners rely on our IBX data centers and expertise around the world for the safe housing of their critical IT equipment and to protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. They also look to Platform Equinix\nfor the ability to directly and securely interconnect to the networks, clouds and content that enable today's information-driven global digital economy. Our recent IBX data center openings and acquisitions, as well as xScale\nTM\ndata center investments, have expanded our total global footprint to 273 IBXs, including 21 xScale data centers and the MC1 and SN1 data centers that are held in unconsolidated joint ventures, across 77 markets around the world. We offer the following solutions:\npremium data center colocation;\ninterconnection and data exchange solutions;\nedge solutions for deploying networking, security and hardware; and\nremote expert support and professional services.\nOur data centers around the world allow our customers to bring together and interconnect the infrastructure they need to fast-track their digital advantage. With Equinix, they can scale with agility, accelerate the launch of digital offerings, deliver world-class experiences and multiply their value. We enable them to differentiate by distributing infrastructure and removing the distance between clouds, users, and applications in order to reduce latency and deliver a superior customer, partner and employee experience. The Equinix global platform, and the quality of our offerings, have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix for bandwidth cost and performance reasons, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers and connect directly with each other. This adjacency creates a network effect that attracts new customers, continuously enhances our existing customers' value and enables them to capture further economic and performance benefits from our offerings.\nWhile a large number of enterprises and service providers, such as hyperscale cloud service providers, own their own data centers, we believe the industry is shifting away from single-tenant solutions to customers outsourcing some or all of their IT housing and interconnection requirements to third-party facilities, such as those operated by Equinix. This shift is being accelerated by the increasing adoption of hybrid multi-cloud architectures and the adoption of artificial intelligence (“AI”).\nHistorically, the outsourcing market was served by large telecommunications carriers that bundled their products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and carrier-neutral multi-tenant data centers (\"MTDC\"), public and private cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, large hyperscale cloud providers and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,400 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. The global MTDC market is highly fragmented. Each of these data center solution providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, outsourced IT infrastructure solutions and managed services. We believe that this outsourcing trend has accelerated and is likely to continue to accelerate in the coming years, especially in light of the movement to digital business, the use of multiple cloud service providers, and the adoption of AI. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 36 countries with the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and a highly scalable set of offerings.\nOur cabinet utilization rate represents the percentage of cabinet space billed versus total cabinet capacity, which is used to measure how efficiently we are managing our cabinet capacity. Our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Our cabinet utilization rates were approximately 78% as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption, which we expect to accelerate with the adoption of AI, has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our existing IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center, and in our ability to expand our footprint in existing and new markets. Additionally, global supply chain challenges could result in a lack of availability or delays in the delivery of data center equipment. These challenges have driven us to invest in and commit to future purchases in advance of our standard practice to mitigate risks associated with these supply chain issues. These constraints could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, results of operations and cash flows and the growth opportunities presented by the adoption of new technologies, including AI.\nExpansion Opportunities:\nTo serve the needs of the growing hyperscale data center market, including the world's largest cloud service providers and increased demand driven in part by the adoption of AI, we have entered into joint venture partnership arrangements across our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions to develop and operate xScale data centers.\nStrategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, power availability and capacity, quality of the design, access to networks, clouds and software partners, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, automation capabilities, developer talent pool, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to our standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.\nOur business is primarily based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to five years in length, and thereafter automatically renews in one-year increments. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three years, more than 90% of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 36% of our recurring revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nOur non-recurring revenues are primarily derived from fees charged from installations related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services we perform for our customers, including our joint ventures. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installations are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the contract term. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a custom"
