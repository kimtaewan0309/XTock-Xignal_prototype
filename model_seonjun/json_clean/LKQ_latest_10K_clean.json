  "item1_clean": "and 18% of our total inventory purchases were made in euros and pounds sterling, respectively, in 2024. We are expanding the distribution of our private label products, which include Optimal, ERA and MPM Oils.\nIn our salvage operations, we purchase severely damaged or total loss vehicles from insurance companies and auctions, which are transferred to our dismantling facilities or sold to other third party dismantlers.\nWe primarily operate a two-step (i.e., direct sales to repair shop customers) distribution model in Europe, although certain businesses located in Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, and Hungary operate partially a three-step (i.e., sales to distributors who in turn sell to repair shop customers) distribution model. In our two-step operations, we sell the majority of our products to commercial customers primarily consisting of professional repairers, including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops. In our three-step operations, we sell products to wholesale distributors or jobbers. In addition to our sales to repair shops and wholesale distributors, we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from e-commerce platforms and from point of sale transactions at branch locations.\nWe currently have operations in approximately 20 different European countries, which we believe represents the broadest and largest footprint in the aftermarket industry in Europe with a distribution network larger than those of any of our principal competitors. Our European operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at national or international distribution centers or regional hubs, with fast moving product stored at branch locations. The large distribution centers regularly restock the smaller branches and hubs and hold slower moving items, helping us to improve fulfillment rates. Product is moved through the distribution network on our trucks, vans or via common carriers. We have major international central distribution centers in Tamworth, England, Sulzbach-Rosenberg, Germany, and Berkel en Rodenrijs, the Netherlands, that have allowed us to consolidate multiple regional distribution centers while maintaining local distribution centers as necessary to support our businesses.\nWe view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors, including other alternative parts suppliers and OEMs and their dealer networks. We face significant competition in many markets where even smaller competitors can compete on price and service, and the OEMs compete via ties to brand loyalty of the consumer while also remaining competitive on price, service and availability. We believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network, efficient inventory management systems and proprietary technology, which allows us to deliver our products quickly, reliably, and at competitive prices.\nInformation Technology Systems\nOur aftermarket operations in Europe use various information technology (\"IT\") systems. Our systems are complex and designed to perform a variety of tasks (depending on the market), including but not limited to customer orders, inventory management, budgeting, analytics, warehouse and logistics, data warehousing, and financial reporting. Certain of our IT systems can interface with the respective IT systems of our repair shop customers, which enables our customers to identify and order the part required for the repair. As part of our efforts to integrate the operations, we are executing a multi-year plan to develop and implement a European wide ERP system, which has reduced and will continue to reduce the number of IT systems we operate through its projected completion date in 2027.\nSPECIALTY SEGMENT\nOur Specialty segment was formed in 2014 with our acquisition of Keystone Specialty, a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories in North America. We subsequently expanded through acquisitions within the core business and adjacent markets, including high performance vehicle equipment and electrical marine products. Our Specialty operations reach most major markets in the U.S. and Canada and serve the following seven product segments: RV; truck and off-road; towing; speed and performance; wheels, tires and performance handling; marine; and miscellaneous accessories.\nThe specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories we distribute and raw materials for products we manufacture are purchased from suppliers located primarily in the U.S., Canada, and China. Our top selling products are recreational vehicles (\"RV\") appliances and air conditioners, towing hitches, truck bed covers, vehicle protection products, marine electronics, cargo management products, and wheels, tires, and suspension products. Our 2017 acquisition of Warn Industries, Inc. (\"Warn\") gave us internal capabilities to manufacture and source aftermarket winches, hoists, and bumpers. Specialty aftermarket suppliers are typically small to medium-sized, independent businesses that focus on a narrow product or market niche. Due to the highly fragmented supplier base for specialty vehicle aftermarket products, we have limited supplier concentration. In 2024, approximately 21% of our specialty vehicle aftermarket purchases were made from our top three suppliers to this segment, with our largest supplier providing approximately 12% of our annual inventory purchases. No other suppliers comprised more than 4% of our purchases during 2024.\nOverall, the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market serves a fragmented customer base composed of RV, marine, and specialty automotive dealers, installers, jobbers, builders, parts chains, and mail-order businesses. Our customers are principally small, independent businesses. These customers depend on us to provide a broad range of products, rapid delivery, marketing support and technical assistance. In addition to traditional customers, we sell to several large parts and accessory online retailers. Our Specialty segment also operates retail stores in northeast Pennsylvania.\nWe promote our products to customers through marketing programs, which include: (i) catalogs, advertising, sponsorships and promotional activities, (ii) product level marketing and merchandising support, and (iii) online and digital marketing initiatives. We stage in-person and/or virtual trade shows across the U.S., which provide an opportunity to improve sales through the showcasing of new and innovative products from our vendors to our customers.\nOnline sales, which represent the majority of our sales, of our Specialty products take place primarily through our ekeystone.com, viantp.com, and SeaWideB2B.com sites and our mobile app. These sites provide customers (i) the ability to match products with the make and model of vehicle thus allowing the customer to order the correct part, (ii) product information (e.g., pictures, attributes) available for review and (iii) the convenience of searching inventory availability and ordering the product on the site. Additionally, these sites can provide sales opportunities by suggesting other parts to purchase based on an inquiry submitted by the customer.\nOur Specialty segment operations employ a hub-and-spoke distribution model that enables us to transport products from our primary distribution centers to our non-inventory stocking cross docks, some of which are co-located with our Wholesale - North America operations and provide distribution points to key regional markets and synergies with our existing infrastructure. We believe this provides added value to our customers through a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process. We use our delivery routes to provide delivery and returns of our products directly to and from our customers in all 48\ncontinental U.S. states and 9 Canadian provinces, and we ship globally to customers in other countries. Our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes, and to track the progress of delivery vehicles.\nIndustry participants have a variety of supply choices. Vendors can deliver products to market via warehouse distributors and mail order catalog businesses, or directly to retailers and/or consumers. We view all distributors of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories as our competitors. We believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and equipment distributors primarily through our broad product selection, which encompasses both popular and hard-to-find products, our national distribution network, and our efficient inventory management systems, as well as through our service. We compete on the basis of product breadth and depth, rapid and dependable delivery, marketing initiatives, support services, and price.\nInformation Technology Systems\nMost of our Specialty operations utilize an internally developed inventory management and order entry system that interfaces with third party software systems for accounting, transaction processing, inventory and warehouse management, data analytics, and reporting. By utilizing an internally developed system, real-time updates, improvements, and developments can be programmed to fit the business’s ongoing and changing needs.\nSELF SERVICE SEGMENT\nOur Self Service segment consists of retail operations, most of which operate under the name “LKQ Pick Your Part,” and allows consumers to come directly to the yard to pick parts off of salvage vehicles. We also sell scrap metal and other materials to recyclers from cars that are no longer available for customers in the yard. In addition to revenue from the sale of parts, cores, scrap steel and other metals, we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property.\nWe acquire salvage vehicles for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources, including but not limited to towing companies, vehicle auctions, the general public, municipality sales, insurance carriers, and charitable organizations. The salvage vehicles we procure are generally older and priced lower than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations. Vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller, or we arrange for transportation. Once on our property, minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the battery, fluids, refrigerants, catalytic converters and hazardous materials. The extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers. Vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts. In our self service business, availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold. We usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 120 days, depending on the capacity of the yard and the number of customers serviced, before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors.\nScrap and Other Materials\nOur self service operations generate scrap metal, alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers. Vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and \"crush only\" vehicles acquired from other companies, including OEMs, are typically crushed using equipment on site. Damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingots and sows for the production of various automotive products. We also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters.\nThe customers of our self service yards are frequently do-it-yourself mechanics, small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles, auto rebuilders, and resellers. The scrap from vehicle hulks is sold to metals recyclers, with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our opera",
  "item7_clean": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty aftermarket products and accessories to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles.\nBuyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by OEMs; new products produced by companies other than the OEMs, which are referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage and total loss vehicles; recycled products that have been refurbished; and recycled products that have been remanufactured. We distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products; recycled collision and mechanical products; refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights; and remanufactured engines and transmissions. Collectively, we refer to the four sources that are not new OEM products as alternative parts.\nWe are organized into four operating segments: Wholesale - North America; Europe; Specialty; and Self Service, each of which is presented as a reportable segment.\nOur Wholesale - North America segment is a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products, paint and body repair related products, and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the United States and Canada. Our Europe segment is a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in Germany, the U.K., the Benelux region, Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, France and various other European countries. Our Specialty segment is a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the U.S. and Canada. Our Self Service segment operates self service retail facilities across the U.S. that sell recycled automotive products from end-of-life-vehicles.\nOur operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Please refer to the factors referred to in Special Note on Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors above. Due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to us at this time, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nWe report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. Our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty products and accessories used to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles. Our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of service-type warranties, fees for admission to our self service yards, and\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Historically, we have not made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates as our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future; however, actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and which require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. For additional information related to significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill is obtained through business acquisitions and recorded at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment annually or sooner if events indicate that an impairment may exist. In performing this test, we compare the carrying value of the asset to its fair value. To derive the fair value for our reporting units which carry goodwill, we consider the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach via a discounted cash flow method and another being a market approach via a guideline public company method. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recognized. In performing the test for impairment of goodwill, goodwill is allocated to the reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nDetermining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating fair values as part of impairment testing require significant judgment. Estimating the fair values of our reporting units which have goodwill requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. As part of applying the discounted cash flow method and guideline public company method, we use significant assumptions which include sales growth, operating margins, discount rates, perpetual growth rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change\nThe balance of our goodwill was $5,448 million and $5,600 million as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023\n, respectively. We have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill during the last three years. The assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with the Company’s operating strategy. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses. During fiscal year 2024, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for our goodwill. No impairment charges were recorded as a result of the testing as the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit exceeded the calculated carrying value. A 10% decline in projected cash flows or a 10% increase in the discount rate would not have resulted in an impairment to goodwill.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, including purchased intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nAccounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in relation to the acquisitions are appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, information obtained from management of the acquired companies and information obtained from independent third party valuation firms and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales and customer contracts, estimated royalty rates used in valuing related intangible assets, customer attrition rates and discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Changes in the estimates applied or values of acquired assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our financial statements. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the originally assigned values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Information by Geographic Area\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe believe that organic revenue growth, Segment EBITDA and free cash flow are key performance indicators for our business. Segment EBITDA is our key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"). Free cash flow is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”).\nOrganic revenue growth\n- We define organic revenue growth as total revenue growth from continuing operations excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures (i.e., revenue generated from the date of acquisition to the first anniversary of that acquisition, net of reduced revenue due to the disposal of businesses) and foreign currency movements (i.e., impact of translating revenue at different exchange rates). Organic revenue growth includes incremental sales from both existing and new (i.e., opened within the last twelve months) locations and is derived from expanding business with existing customers, securing new customers and offering additional products and services. We believe that organic revenue growth is a key performance indicator as this statistic measures our ability to serve and grow our customer base successfully.\n- We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow provides insight into our liquidity and provides useful information to management and investors concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase stock, and pay dividends.\nThese three key performance indicators are used as targets in determining incentive compensation at various levels of the organization, including senior management. By using these performance measures, we attempt to motivate a balanced approach to the business that rewards growth, profitability and cash flow generation in a manner that enhances our long-term prospects.\nResults of Operations—Consolidated\nThe following table sets forth statements of income data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n\nGross margin increased by $25 million, or 1.0%, to $2,511 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This increase was driven by the acquisition of Uni-Select, partially offset by a decrease in parts and services organic revenue and a decline in commodities prices. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of total segment revenue of 3.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the dilutive nature of the acquisition of Uni-Select, which changed the segment's product mix to reflect a greater percentage of paint, body and equipment and maintenance product lines. These product lines have a lower gross margin structure than our other wholesale product lines. Additionally, the gross margin was negatively affected by the related mix effect resulting from lower aftermarket revenue, which has a higher margin than our other wholesale lines as well as decreases in salvage margins tied to softening salvage revenue and a decline in commodities prices.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $32 million, or 2.3%, to $1,567 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expense primarily reflects unfavorable impacts of (i) $71 million from personnel costs excluding incentive compensation primarily due to the acquisition of Uni-Select, (ii) $36 million from facility costs primarily due to the acquisition of Uni-Select, (iii) $11 million from increased freight, vehicle, and fuel costs, partially offset by (iv) $42 million from lower incentive compensation, (v) $27 million from\nprofessional fees primarily related to proceeds from the favorable settlement of a legal claim in 2024, (vi) $6 million from lower charitable contributions in the prior year period, and (vii) other individually immaterial factors representing an $11 million favorable impact in the aggregate. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of total segment revenue decreased by 1.8% to 27.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition to the factors noted above, the decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of total segment revenue was driven by cost saving initiatives and acquisition related synergies, partially offset by inflationary pressures.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Revenue to Segment EBITDA in our Europe segment (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n% of Total Segment Revenue\n% of Total Segment Revenue\nParts & services revenue\nTotal segment revenue\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nLess: Other segment items\nParts and services revenue increased by $83 million, or 1.3%, to $6,386 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a parts and services organic revenue increase of $76 million, or 1.2% (0.7% on a per day basis), driven by pricing initiatives to offset increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures and, to a lesser extent, increased volumes.\nGross margin increased by $17 million, or 0.7%, to $2,454 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue through pricing initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable customer mix, inflationary pressures and a $16 million reduction primarily related to restructuring expenses incurred as part of the 2024 Global Restructuring Plan. These restructuring expenses are excluded from the calculation of Segment EBITDA. See Note 13, \"Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\" and Note 25, \"Segment and Geographic Information\" for further information.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $13 million, or 0.7%, to $1,855 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense primarily reflects unfavorable impacts of (i) $15 million from professional fees related to several strategic central and regional IT initiatives, (ii) $",
