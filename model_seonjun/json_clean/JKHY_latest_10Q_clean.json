The total net income increase, quarter over quarter, was lower when adjusted for the gain on sale of assets and deconversion net income in the current fiscal quarter and the net income related to a contractual change and deconversion net income in the prior fiscal year first quarter. The increase excluding these one-time items was primarily due to net organic growth in our lines of revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 partially offset by commensurate higher operating expenses and the increased provision for income taxes.\nREPORTABLE SEGMENT DISCUSSION\nThe Company is a well-rounded financial technology company and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily to community and regional banks and credit unions.\nThe Company’s operations are classified into four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other. The Core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions, which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and maintain centralized accountholder information. The Payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services, including ATM, debit, and credit card processing services, online and mobile bill pay solutions, ACH origination and remote deposit capture processing, and risk management products and services. The Complementary segment provides additional software, hosted processing platforms, and services, including digital/mobile banking, treasury services, online account opening, fraud/anti-money laundering (\"AML\") and lending/deposit solutions that can be integrated with the Company's Core solutions, and many can be used independently. The Corporate and Other segment includes revenue and costs from hardware and other products not attributed to any of the other three segments, as well as operating expenses not directly attributable to the other three segments.\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is also the Company's CODM, regularly evaluated segment performance and made strategic decisions on the allocation of resources to them based on various factors, including performance against trend, budget, and forecast for the fiscal three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024. The CODM also used reportable segment revenue, costs of revenue, and segment income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. The Company has not disclosed any additional asset information by segment, as the information is not generated for internal management reporting to the CODM.\nDuring the fiscal three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company transferred a product from the Corporate and Other segment to the Complementary segment, due to better alignment with the Complementary segment. As a result of this transfer, adjustments were made during the fiscal three months ended September 30, 2025, to reclassify related revenue and cost of revenue recognized for the fiscal three months ended September 30, 2024, from the Corporate and Other segment to the Complementary segment. Revenue and cost of revenue reclassed for the fiscal three months ended September 30, 2024, was $3,242 and $704, respectively\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nJack Henry & Associates, Inc. is a well-rounded financial technology company headquartered in Monett, Missouri, that employs approximately 7,200 full-time and part-time associates nationwide, and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily to community and regional banks and credit unions. Our solutions serve approximately 7,400 clients and consist of integrated data processing systems solutions to U.S. banks ranging from de novo to multi-billion-dollar institutions with assets up to $55 billion, core data processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes, and non-core highly specialized core-agnostic products and services that enable banks and credit unions of every asset size and charter, and diverse corporate entities outside the financial services industry, to mitigate and control risks, optimize revenue and growth opportunities, and contain costs. Our integrated solutions are available for on-premise installation and delivery in our private and public cloud.\nEach of our solutions shares the fundamental commitment to provide high-quality business systems, service levels that consistently exceed client expectations, and integration of solutions and practical new technologies. The quality of our solutions, our high service standards, and the fundamental way we do business typically foster long-term client relationships, attract prospective clients, and have enabled us to capture substantial market share.\nThrough internal product development, disciplined acquisitions, and alliances with companies offering niche solutions that complement our proprietary solutions, we regularly introduce new products and services and generate new cross-sales opportunities. We provide compatible computer hardware for our on-premise installations and secure processing environments for our outsourced solutions in our private and public cloud. We perform data conversions, software implementations, initial and ongoing client training, and ongoing client support services.\nWe believe our primary competitive advantage is client service. Our support infrastructure and strict standards provide service levels that generate high levels of client satisfaction and retention. We consistently measure client satisfaction using a variety of surveys, such as an annual survey on the client's anniversary date and randomly-generated surveys initiated each day by routine support requests. Dedicated surveys are also used to grade specific aspects of our client experience, including product implementation, education, and consulting services.\nOur two primary revenue streams are “services and support” and “processing.” Services and support includes: “private and public cloud” revenues that predominantly have contract terms of six years at inception; “product delivery and services” revenues, which include revenues from the sales of licenses, implementation services, deconversions, consulting, and hardware; and “on-premise support” revenues, composed of maintenance fees that primarily contain annual contract terms. Processing includes: \"remittance” revenues from payment processing, remote capture, and ACH transactions; “card” revenues, including card transaction processing and monthly fees; and “transaction and digital” revenues, which include transaction and mobile processing revenues. We continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins.\nWe have four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other. The respective segments include all related revenues along with the related cost of revenue.\nA detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows. All amounts in the following discussion are in thousands, except per share amounts.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2026, total revenue increased 7.3%, or $43,756, compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2025. Total revenue less deconversion revenue of $8,626 for the current fiscal quarter and less revenue related to a contractual change of $12,248 and deconversion revenue of $3,697 for the prior fiscal year first quarter results in an increase of 8.7% quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily driven by organic growth in our revenue lines including data processing and hosting within private and public cloud, card, Jack Henry digital, including Banno, and payment processing, including PayCenter products. Increased user group revenue related to the timing of our Connect conference was also a driver.\nOperating expenses increased 2.4%, or $10,967, for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Total operating expenses less the gain on sale of assets of $3,796 and deconversion operating expenses of $1,525 for the current fiscal quarter and less operating expenses related to a contractual change of $10,443 and deconversion operating expenses of $202 for the prior fiscal year first quarter results in an increase of 5.4% quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher direct costs, increased expenses related to our Connect conference, higher personnel costs tempered by lower benefits costs, and increased amortization of intangible assets.\nOperating income increased 21.7%, or $32,789, for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Total operating income less the gain on sale of assets of $3,796 and deconversion operating income of $7,101 for the current fiscal quarter and less operating income related to a contractual change of $1,805 and deconversion operating income of $3,495 for the prior fiscal year first quarter results in an increase of 18.6%, quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily driven by organic revenue growth partially offset by increased operating expenses detailed above tempered by our disciplined approach to compensation, headcount and infrastructure costs.\nThe provision for income taxes increased 23.2%, or $8,725, for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in income before income taxes. The effective tax rate for the current fiscal quarter was 24.3% compared to 24.0% for the same quarter a year ago.\nNet income increased 20.8%, or $24,795, for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025.
