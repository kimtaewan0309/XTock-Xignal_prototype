Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nDocuments To Review In Connection With Management’s Discussion and Analysis Of Financial Condition and Results Of Operations\nLam Research Corporation 2025 Q3 10-Q\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLam Research Corporation is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale manufacturing enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering, and a broad range of operational disciplines. Our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, cloud and enterprise servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices.\nOur customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as non-volatile memory, dynamic random-access memory, and logic devices. Their continued success is part of our commitment to driving semiconductor breakthroughs that define the next generation. Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control, enabling results on the wafer.\nSemiconductor manufacturing, our customers’ business, involves the fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. This involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. Fabricating these devices requires a sequence of highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. Along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.\nDemand from cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 5G, the Internet of Things, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. At the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional two-dimensional scaling. These trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical scaling strategies like three-dimensional architecture as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks.\nWe believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and expertise in deposition, etch, and clean markets to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. Our Customer Support Business Group provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance, predictability, and operational efficiency. Several factors create opportunities for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several ongoing programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with semi-ecosystem partners, including our close-to-customer focus; (iv) our ability to identify and invest in the breadth of our product portfolio to meet technology inflections; and (v) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam’s solutions to our customers.\nWafer fabrication equipment spending levels are strong in the 2025 calendar year driven by an increase in both the memory and non-memory market segments. In the short term, volatility in the semiconductor industry environment from trade restrictions, tariffs, as well as other direct and indirect risks and uncertainties, have had, and in the future may have, a negative impact on our revenue and operating margin. Over the longer term, we believe that secular demand for semiconductors, combined with technology inflections in our industry, including 3D device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow, and advanced packaging chip integration, will drive sustainable growth and lead to an increase in the served available market for our products and services in the deposition, etch, and clean businesses.\nLam Research Corporation 2025 Q3 10-Q\nThe following table summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below:\n(in thousands, except per share data and percentages)\nGross margin as a percent of total revenue\nTotal operating expenses\nDiluted net income per share\nIn the September 2025 quarter, revenue increased 3% compared to the three months ended\n(the “June 2025 quarter”), driven by an increase in systems revenue as a result of sustained investments in the Foundry market segment as well as increases in customer support-related revenue. T\nhe deferred revenue balance was $2.77 billion at the end of the September 2025 quarter, an increase relative to the balance at the end of the June 2025 quarter of $2.68 billion.\nWe aim to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources, as well as performance to our operational and financial objectives. As a result, from time to time, we exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing and deliveries of products, which has impacted, including in the current fiscal year, and may in the future impact, the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products.\nThe increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the September 2025 quarter compared to the June 2025 quarter was primarily a result of favorable changes in customer mix, partially offset by reduced factory efficiencies, higher tariff-related spend, and increased material costs. The increase in operating expenses in the September 2025 quarter compared to the June 2025 quarter was driven by an increase in employee-related costs tied to higher headcount, partially offset by lower elective deferred compensation plan-related costs.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances increased to $6.7 billion at the end of the September 2025 quarter compared to $6.4 billion at the end of the June 2025 quarter. This increase was primarily the result of $1,779.0 million of cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by $975.8 million of share repurchases, including net share settlement of employee stock-based compensation and excise tax; $292.0 million of dividends paid to stockholders; and $185.1 million of capital expenditures. Employee headcount as of September 28, 2025 was approximately 19,400.\nLam Research Corporation 2025 Q3 10-Q\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenue (in millions)\nThe increase in revenue in the September 2025 quarter compared to the same period in 2024 was tied to increases in Foundry equipment spending by our customers as well as higher customer support-related revenue.\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated between systems and customer support-related revenue:\nCustomer support-related revenue and other\nThe percentage of leading- and non-leading-edge equipment and upgrade revenue from each of the markets we serve was as follows:\nLogic/integrated device manufacturing\nThe increase in the foundry market segment for the September 2025 quarter compared to the June 2025 quarter was driven by mature node investments. This increase was offset by\nmemory which was attributable to a decrease in non-volatile memory.\n\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nThe increase in the effective tax rate for the September 2025 quarter compared to the June 2025 quarter was primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits from lapses of statutes of limitation in the June 2025 quarter, the change in level and proportion of income in higher and lower tax jurisdictions, the revaluation of deferred taxes due to changes in the U.S. taxation of non-U.S. income under OBBBA, and GMT being fully effective starting in the September 2025 quarter.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate for the September 2025 quarter compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the change in level and proportion of income in higher and lower tax jurisdictions, the revaluation of deferred taxes due to changes in the U.S. taxation of non-U.S. income under OBBBA, and GMT being fully effective starting in the September 2025 quarter.\nWe re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nBEPS 2.0 GMT is fully effective for us this fiscal year. We assessed our exposure to GMT under currently enacted legislation and determined that we expect to meet transitional safe harbor requirements in most jurisdictions, with limited jurisdictions subject to GMT.\nOn July 4, 2025, the OBBBA was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump. The impact on income taxes due to change in legislation is required, under ASC 740, Income Taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted, which is this fiscal year. In general, the OBBBA introduces changes to U.S. taxation, including changes in the taxation of non-U.S. income.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nTotal gross cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances were $6.7 billion at September 28, 2025 compared to $6.4 billion as of June 29, 2025. The increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities totaling $1,779.0 million, partially offset by $975.8 million of share repurchases, including net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation and excise tax; $292."
