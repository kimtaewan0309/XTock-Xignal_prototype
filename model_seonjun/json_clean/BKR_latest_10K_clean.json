This product line is the primary driver of the Company's new energy orders and is designed to accelerate the decarbonization of both energy and broader industrial verticals such as hard-to-abate industries, like steel and cement.\nIET customers for the Gas Technology Equipment and Gas Technology Services product lines are industrial, upstream, midstream, and downstream, onshore and offshore, and small-to-large scale. Midstream and downstream customers include LNG plants, pipelines, storage facilities, refineries, and a wide range of industrial and engineering, procurement, and construction companies. Products and services for the remaining IET product lines are primarily sold in a diversified arena to a broad range of customers and across multiple verticals, including aerospace, automotive, nuclear, oil and gas, mining, cement, metals, refinery and petrochemical, food and beverage, pulp & paper, and textile.\nIET differentiates itself from competitors with its diverse portfolio, expertise in technology and project management, local presence, and partnerships, to provide fully integrated solutions for a broad array of industry segments.\nIET competes across a wide range of industries, including oil and gas, power generation, aerospace, and light and heavy industrials. IET main competitors include Siemens Energy, Solar (a Caterpillar company), Mitsubishi Heavy Industry, Chart, Sulzer, Flowserve, and Emerson.\nCONTRACTS\nWe conduct our business under various types of contracts in the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry, including fixed-fee or turnkey contracts, transactional agreements for products and services, and long-term aftermarket service agreements. We also conduct business in a number of industrial\nmarkets and provide critical equipment hardware capability for full plant offerings, asset performance management and process optimization.\nWe benefit from stable relationships with many of our customers based on long-term project contracts and master service agreements. Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer's technical specifications with little or no relief available due to changes in circumstances. In some cases, failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims. We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers.\nWe strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices. In connection with oil and gas operations, our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of their employees and often their contractors; the loss of or damage to their facility and equipment, and often that of their contractors; pollution originating from their equipment or facility; and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations, including loss or damage to the well or reservoir, loss of well control, fire, explosion, or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of our employees and often that of our subcontractors; the loss of or damage to our equipment; and surface pollution originating from our equipment while under our control. Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices (e.g., in connection with industrial and/or digital sectors), we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence and include an overall limitation of liability clause. It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss, including loss of profits and loss of revenue, in all customer contracts.\nOur indemnity structure may not protect us in every case. Certain U.S. states have enacted oil and natural gas specific anti-indemnity statutes that can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract. Applicable law or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of gross negligence or willful misconduct, or in the event of breaches of applicable laws or breach of confidentiality and/or intellectual property rights. We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products. It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any end-user claims, but this is not always possible. Similarly, government agencies and other third parties may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault. We have an established process to review any risk deviations from our standard contracting practices.\nThe Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable; however, clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program. All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible and/or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment, specific terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions. There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business.\nORDERS AND REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\nRemaining performance obligations (\"RPO\"), a defined term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), are unfilled customer orders for products and product services excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty, even if the likelihood of cancellation is remote based on historical experience. For product services, an amount is included for the expected life of the contract.\nWe recognized orders of $28.2 billion, $30.5 billion, and $26.8 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We recognized OFSE orders of $15.2 billion, $16.3 billion, and $14.1 billion, and IET orders of $13.0 billion, $14.2 billion, and $12.7 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining performance obligations totaled $33.1 billion. As of December 31, 2024, OFSE remaining performance obligations totaled $3.0 billion, and IET remaining performance obligations totaled $30.1 billion.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nWe engage in R&D activities across the business directed toward the development of new products, services, technology, and other solutions, as well as bringing about a significant improvement to existing products and services, and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs. We also continue to invest and develop a range of technologies that support our customers' efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $643 million of R&D expense.\nIn OFSE, we continue to fund a range of formation evaluation, drilling, completions, and production capabilities and products. In parallel, and in strong collaboration with the IET technology organization, we are investing in strategic themes that fuel our future product and service portfolios. These include themes such as digital, automation, electrification, chemistry and materials, electronics, CCUS, and geothermal.\nSpecifically for OFSE, in our Well Construction product line, we are improving reliability in high-temperature and high shock and vibration environments (harsh-drilling conditions), through a combination of optimized design, automated operations, and integrated solutions that leverage our drilling tools, drill bits, and drilling fluids technologies. In our Completions, Intervention, and Measurements product line, we are investing in intelligent solutions and advanced measurements while creating a leadership position in the well-intervention domain through the integration of our wireline measurement capabilities with the conveyance and intervention capabilities. In our Production Solutions product line, we are leveraging our artificial lift technologies with our chemical solutions to provide an optimized and automated portfolio of production-enhancing solutions. In our Subsea & Surface Pressure Solutions product line, we continue to develop subsea production systems that improve performance and reduce emissions through lighter design, automated operations, and electrification.

Within Industrial Technology, we are investing in advanced digital solutions designed to improve the efficiency, reliability, and safety of oil and gas, aerospace, energy, and broader industrial production and operations. This includes our Orbit 60 Bently Nevada product for critical asset monitoring in turbine systems, including wind, hydro, and gas turbines. The IET segment is also enhancing its process and safety valve business bringing new digital applications including analytics to our customers. Investments in Industrial Technology also include technologies to measure, monitor, and minimize carbon emissions, new inspection technologies for nondestructive evaluation of materials and structures as well as solutions for industrial asset management.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur technology, brands and other intellectual property (\"IP\") rights are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure and employee invention assignment agreements to protect our IP rights. Many patents and patent applications comprise the Baker Hughes portfolio and are owned by us. Othe",
  "item7_clean": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We operate through our two business segments: OFSE and IET. We sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream and downstream segments, as well as broader industrial and new energy markets.\nDuring 2024, Baker Hughes continued to deliver significant improvement across the company and in our financial results over 2023. We capitalized on market tailwinds to deliver substantial IET revenue growth, navigated an uneven market to deliver modest OFSE revenue growth, and realized widening benefits from our transformation efforts across the company. We also maintained strong order momentum in IET, led by significant growth in new energy and non-LNG equipment orders.\nAs we look to 2025, we see a muted outlook for global upstream spending due to recent oil price volatility and an oil market that looks well supplied in the near term, which might affect activity across our OFSE portfolio. Continued discipline from the world's largest producers and the pace of oil demand growth will remain important factors to monitor. Geopolitics remain another element of uncertainty across the oil and gas markets affecting macroeconomic conditions and upstream spending.\nWe are seeing customer spending trends shift more towards natural gas and low-carbon solutions, and we expect this trend to continue in 2025, which will continue to support strength across our IET portfolio. We remain optimistic on the LNG outlook, supporting the shift towards the development of natural gas and LNG. As a result, the global LNG project pipeline remains strong. Additionally, robust orders over the past few years are set to drive significant growth in our equipment installed base, which will underpin steady growth in Gas Technology Service over the coming years. Continued signs of tightness in the aeroderivative supply chain will remain an important factor to monitor.\nFinancial Results and Key Company Initiatives\nIn 2024, the Company generated revenues of $27.8 billion, compared to $25.5 billion in 2023, increasing $2.3 billion or 9%. The increase in revenue was driven principally by IET. IET revenue increased $2.1 billion, primarily driven by Gas Technology Equipment revenue. OFSE revenue increased $0.3 billion driven by international revenue. Operating income was $3.1 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 2023, increasing $0.8 billion. The increase to operating income was driven by higher volume primarily from higher proportionate growth in Gas Technology Equipment (\"GTE\") and Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems (\"SSPS\") and price in both segments, and structural cost-out initiatives across the company, partially offset by cost inflation.\nAs our journey of transformation continues, we have made progress in our efforts to improve efficiencies and modernize how the business operates. The business has undertaken significant structural changes and we see the operating benefits coming through in the margin performance.\nBaker Hughes remains committed to a flexible capital allocation policy that balances returning cash to shareholders and investing in growth opportunities. We increased our quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2024 by one cent to $0.21 per share. For the full year of 2024, we returned a total of $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nOur business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today and are subject to changing conditions in the industry.\nOFSE North America activity: In 2025, we expect a second consecutive year of lower E&P spending due to recent commodity price volatility and E&P consolidation.\nOFSE International activity: We expect spending outside of North America to be at similar or slightly lower levels in 2025 compared to 2024.\nIET outlook: We see continued strength in LNG, Floating Production Storage and Offloading (\"FPSO\"), gas infrastructure, and new energy, as well as increasing opportunities to leverage our versatile portfolio to enhance IET's position across industrial and distributed power markets.\nWe have other businesses in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics, including global GDP growth. We also have businesses within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions, specifically focused around reducing carbon emissions of the energy and broader industry, including: hydrogen; geothermal; CCUS; energy storage; clean power; and emissions abatement solutions. We expect to see continued growth in these global businesses as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix.\nOverall, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. Over time, we believe the world's demand for energy will continue to rise, and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the world's energy needs for the foreseeable future. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, low-emission, and cost-effective solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe following discussion and analysis summarize the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nOur revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations, and their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOutside North America, customer spending is influenced by Brent oil prices. In North America, customer spending is influenced by WTI oil prices and natural gas prices are measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price.\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\nBrent oil prices ($/Bbl)\nWTI oil prices ($/Bbl)\nNatural gas prices ($/mmBtu)\nEnergy Information Administration (\"EIA\") Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel\nEIA Cushing, OK West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") spot price\nEIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit\nRig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Therefore, rig counts may act as a leading indicator of market activity and reflect the relative strength of energy prices however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nRig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nOur consolidated statements of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC regulations under which \"goods\" is required to include all sales of tangible products and \"services\" must include all other sales, including other service activities. For the amounts shown below, we distinguish between \"equipment\" and \"product services,\" where product services refer to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of our operations. We refer to \"product services\" simply as \"services\" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOur results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level. The performance of our operating segments is primarily evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and before the following: net interest expense, net other non-operating income (loss), unallocated corporate expenses, significant restructuring plans, impairment and other charges, inventory impairments, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.\nIn evaluating the performance, we primarily use the following:\nVolume is defined as the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. Volume also includes price, which is defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.\nForeign Exchange (\"FX\"):\n\nOur cash that is held outside the U.S. is 82% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2024. Depending on the jurisdiction or country where this cash is held, we may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.\nGuarantor Financial Information\nWe guarantee various senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured debentures (collectively, the \"Debt Securities\") outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $5,797 million as of December 31, 2024, with maturities ranging from 2026 to 2047. The Debt Securities constitute debt obligations of BHH LLC, an indirect, 100% owned subsidiary and the primary operating company of Baker Hughes, and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc, a 100% owned finance subsidiary of BHH LLC (together with BHH LLC, the \"Issuers\") that was incorporated for the sole purpose of serving as a corporate co-obligor of debt securities. The Debt Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other senior and unsecured debt obligations. However, because these obligations are not secured, they would be effectively subordinated to any existing or future secured indebtedness of Baker Hughes and the Issuers.\nAs required under SEC Rule 13-01, we have included summarized financial information for the Issuers because the combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Issuers are materially different than the corresponding amounts in our consolidated financial statements due to the release of a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets.\nSummarized Income Statement data\nNet income attributable to Baker Hughes Company\nSummarized Balance Sheet data\nNoncurrent liabilities\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to a material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our consolidated financial statements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, or the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment, but they are not deemed critical as defined above.\nRevenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements\nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers, primarily within our IET segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have an average contract term of greater than 10 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates. Revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an over time basis using input methods to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.\nTo develop our billing estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimate",
