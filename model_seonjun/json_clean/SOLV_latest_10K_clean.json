We constantly seek to enable the improvement of standards of care and move healthcare forward with innovation powered by insights, clinical intelligence, technology, and manufacturing expertise. Our 70+ year history of discovering and innovating advanced solutions has helped us solve our customers’ toughest challenges.\nOur solutions are relied on every day within the global healthcare industry to deliver higher-quality patient care, more efficient processes and workflows, and improved standards of safety and accuracy. Additionally, our products and services are present along a patient’s journey through prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and recovery.\nOur business possesses strong customer relationships, a broad, wide-ranging, and well-known portfolio of brands, differentiated technology, and manufacturing expertise. We serve a diverse customer base, ranging from multidisciplinary hospitals and local clinics/practices to biopharmaceutical manufacturers. Our long-tenured and collaborative customer relationships globally give us unique insights into their needs and preferences. These insights inform our innovation processes, drive stronger customer retention, and create multiple avenues for further customer engagement.\nWe are organized into four operating business segments that are aligned with the markets we serve.\nMedSurg (56.2% of 2024 total sales)\nis a provider of solutions including negative pressure wound therapy, advanced wound dressings, advanced skin care, I.V. site management, sterilization assurance, temperature management, surgical supplies, medical tapes and wraps, stethoscopes, medical electrodes, and medical technologies Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM\n. These solutions are designed to accelerate healing, prevent complications, and lower the total cost of care. Additionally, our comprehensive range of surgical solutions are designed to mitigate a patient’s risk of infection or complications.\nDental Solutions (15.7% of 2024 total sales)\nis a provider of a comprehensive suite of dental and orthodontic products including brackets, aligners, restorative cements, and bonding agents that span the “life of the tooth,” including products designed for preventative dental care, direct and indirect restoration, and broad orthodontic needs.\nHealth Information Systems (15.8% of 2024 total sales)\nprovides healthcare systems with software solutions – including computer-assisted physician documentation, direct-to-bill and coding automation, classification methodologies, speech recognition, and data visualization platforms – that are designed to eliminate revenue cycle waste, create more time for patient care, and support value-based care. These solutions are designed to ensure accuracy of reimbursement and reduce the administrative burden that clinicians face.\nPurification and Filtration (11.6% of 2024 total sales)\nis a provider of purification and filtration technologies including filters, purifiers, cartridges, and membranes. These solutions are designed to simplify purification processes, reduce debris and bioburden in fluids, and remove contaminants to enable the development and manufacturing of biopharmaceutical and medical technology treatments and provide cleaner water.\nAs part of our business strategy, Solventum intends to monitor its business portfolio and organizational structure and may make acquisitions that expand or enhance its organizational structure.\nResearch and Development Activities\nOur Research and Development (“R&D\n) activities are focused on developing new solutions that are clinically supported and differentiated as well as improving on our marketed solutions to address evolving customer needs and enable better outcomes and access for patients. Our R&D capabilities include R&D organizations that operate within each of our business segments, as well as R&D capabilities spanning across our business segments.\nOur business segment R&D organizations are responsible for the full product development life cycle, leveraging industry insights, domain-specific expertise in end-to-end product development, and a detailed understanding of customer applications\n\nand usability to innovate in both new and marketed products. Our cross-segment capabilities include building new shared technologies and advancing existing shared technologies. We believe that collaboration across our organization further enhances our R&D capabilities by encouraging the sharing of best practices, enabling collaborative development and issue resolution, promoting synergies in development and manufacturing, and creating a broad culture of exploration.\nOur R&D team consists of approximately 2,000 employees, including research scientists, chemical engineers, data scientists, software engineers, application development engineers and product developers. They are supported by a team of accomplished clinicians from our medical affairs group. We partner with our medical affairs group to enhance our clinical insight and expand awareness of clinical studies regarding our solutions by increasing both the number of peer-reviewed publications and the visibility for existing publications that address our solutions.\nIntellectual Property\nDevelopment and protection of our proprietary technologies through IP rights is a strategic priority for our business. To protect our proprietary technologies, Solventum relies on a combination of patent, design, utility model, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protections as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and confidentiality agreements. Our IP team collaborates with our R&D and product teams to develop product line focused IP strategies and secure IP rights as appropriate. We generally file patent applications in the United States and foreign countries that have strong technology patent protections. We also license from third parties IP that complements our internal R&D efforts and product offerings. While, in aggregate, our patents and other IP are vital to our operations, we do not consider any single IP asset or group of assets to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole; rather, we believe understanding our customers’ needs, technology expertise, and manufacturing know-how are critical for our business.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets across our segments and product categories throughout the world. Our ability to compete effectively is contingent upon several factors, including but not limited to our ability to deliver differentiated clinical and economic outcomes for our customers.\nIn the MedSurg segment, our advanced wound care market is highly competitive, particularly in the United States and Europe, with our principal competitors including Smith & Nephew, Medela, Mölnlycke, Coloplast, and Convatec. Our infection prevention and surgical supplies solutions are offered in highly competitive and fragmented end markets, especially in the United States and Europe. Our principal competitors in this segment include Becton Dickinson, Hartmann, ICU Medical, Medline, Cardinal Health, Fortive, Steris, MDF Instruments, and BSN.\nThe dental market is highly competitive, with players ranging from very large broad-based multinational companies to localized or specialized suppliers and start-ups. Principal multinational competitors within the oral care market include Dentsply Sirona, Envista, and Straumann, all of which compete with both dental and orthodontic solutions, and Ivoclar, which competes with only dental solution offerings, and Align Technology, which competes with only orthodontic solution offerings.\nThe health care software technology market in which we conduct our business, and the healthcare information technology (“HCIT\n) industry in general, is highly competitive and dynamic, characterized by the continual introduction of new products and technologies. Principal competitors include Optum, Microsoft (Nuance), Epic, Cerner, Athena, and a host of start-up technologies actively working to disrupt the areas of revenue cycle management and clinician productivity. In the United States, the market for value-based care software solutions is highly fragmented and subject to continuous entry of new competitors. The market is even more fragmented internationally. Outside the U.S., we compete primarily with local players in the respective country or region, in addition to new market entrants.\nThe Purification and Filtration segment competes against a diverse spectrum of competitors. Established global filtration competitors such as Danaher, Merck KGaA, Sartorius, Pentair, Repligen, and Entegris compete on a variety of factors across product lines, including breadth of offering, product performance, customer service, product availability, distribution capabilities, innovation, name recognition and price.\nWe have a long-tenured and diverse talent base with significant work experience, technical qualifications, and healthcare industry expertise. Our employee base consists of approximately 22,000 employees, with approximately 40% having more than 10 years of tenure. We have approximately 11,000 employees in the United States and approximately 2,600 in Germany. Of our employees, approximately 5,200 are production employees working in plants across the globe. We have approximately 80 employees who are represented by a union in the U.S., all of whom are in one manufacturing facility and are covered by a three-year collective bargaining agreement that expires on November 1, 2027.

The consolidated financial statements herein for periods prior to the Spin-Off may not be indicative of the Company’s future performance, do not necessarily include the actual expenses that would have been incurred, and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had we been a separate, standalone company during the historical periods presented.\nIn particular, Solventum benefited from 3M’s long operating history, reputation and well-known brand. Following the separation, Solventum is operating under its own brand, and accordingly may be negatively impacted due to the loss of benefits conferred by 3M’s brand recognition and reputation. In addition, the debt obligations incurred by Solventum in connection with the separation will adversely affect its profitability and could affect its ability to use its cash flow for investing in the business, strategic transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, and returning capital.
