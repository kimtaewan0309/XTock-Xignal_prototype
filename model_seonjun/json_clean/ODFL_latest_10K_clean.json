In response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products, particularly diesel fuel, we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements. The fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base, which is generally indexed to the DOE’s published fuel prices that reset each week. Volatility in the price of diesel fuel has impacted our business, as described in this report. However, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any of the past three years.\n\nOur productive labor costs, which include wages for drivers, platform employees, and fleet technicians, increased as a percent of revenue to 24.1% in 2024 from 23.6% in 2023. We continued to operate efficiently in 2024, despite the decrease in network density that generally results from the decline in volumes. Our P&D shipments and stops per hour both improved in 2024 as compared to 2023, which helped offset the reduction in our linehaul laden load factor. Our other salaries and wages as a percent of revenue also increased to 9.5% in 2024 as compared to 9.0% in 2023.\n\nRevenue decreased $51.3 million, or 0.9%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due to a decrease in volumes that was partially offset by an increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. LTL tonnage per day decreased 3.6% primarily due to decreases in LTL shipments per day and LTL weight per shipment. This decrease in our volumes was partially offset by a 2.4% increase in our LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our LTL revenue per hundredweight includes the impact of lower fuel surcharges resulting from a decline in the average price of diesel fuel from the comparable period. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.0% in 2024 as compared to 2023. We believe the increase in our LTL revenue-per-hundredweight metrics was driven by the ongoing execution of our yield management strategy. Our consistent, cost-based approach to pricing focuses on offsetting our cost inflation while also supporting additional investments into our business to expand capacity and enhance our technology.\n\nOperating supplies and expenses decreased $83.0 million, or 11.6%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, due primarily to decreases in our costs for diesel fuel used in our vehicles and lower maintenance and repair costs. The cost of diesel fuel, excluding fuel taxes, represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses, and can vary based on both the average price per gallon and consumption. Our average cost per gallon of diesel fuel decreased 14.6% in 2024 as compared to 2023. We do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments; therefore, our costs are subject to market price fluctuations. Our gallons consumed also decreased 3.5% in 2024 as compared to 2023 due primarily to a decrease in our miles driven. Our other operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue decreased in 2024 as compared to 2023 due primarily to lower maintenance and repair costs, as we improved the average age of our fleet by consistently executing on our capital expenditure programs.\n\nOur financial results for 2024 reflect continued softness in the domestic economy that contributed to the decline in our revenue. Despite the decrease in our LTL tons, we maintained a commitment to providing superior customer service to support the continued improvement in our yield as we provided our customers with 99% on-time service and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1% during the year. We maintained our focus on operating efficiently and controlling discretionary spending during the year, but the increase in costs and the deleveraging effect from the decrease in revenue led to an increase in our operating ratio. As a result, our net income and diluted earnings per share decreased by 4.3% and 2.7%, respectively, as compared to 2023.\n\nOur primary revenue focus is to increase density, which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure. Increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity, which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor, pickup and delivery (“P&D”) stops per hour, P&D shipments per hour, platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour. In addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies, it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield, which is measured as revenue per hundredweight, on the shipments we handle. We focus on the profitability of each customer account and generally seek to obtain an appropriate yield to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in capacity and technology. We believe the continued execution of this yield-management philosophy, continued increases in density, and ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies are the key components of our ability to further improve our operating ratio and long-term profitable growth.\n\nIn establishing accruals for claims and expenses, we evaluate and monitor each claim individually, and we use factors such as historical claims development experience, known trends and third-party actuarial estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liabilities. We believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable; however, any changes in the severity or number of reported claims, significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods. Our accrued liability for BIPD and workers’ compensation claims totaled $137.3 million and $127.0 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Claims and insurance accruals are discussed further in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nLTL Weight Per Shipment\n- Fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the mix of freight we receive from our customers, as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment. Generally, increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand for our customers’ products and overall increased economic activity. Changes in weight per shipment can also be influenced by shifts between LTL and other modes of transportation, such as truckload and intermodal, in response to capacity, service and pricing issues. Fluctuations in weight per shipment generally have an inverse effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as a decrease in weight per shipment will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight.\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $20.1 million, or 6.2%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increases in depreciation and amortization costs were due primarily to the assets acquired as part of our 2023 and 2024 capital expenditure programs. We believe depreciation costs will continue to increase in future periods based on our 2025 capital expenditure plan. While our investments in real estate, equipment, and technology can increase our short-term costs, we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued long-term growth and strategic initiatives.\n\nThe cost attributable to employee benefits increased $13.5 million, or 1.9%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to the annual wage increase as well as an increase in costs associated with our group health and dental plans. This increase in employee benefit costs was partially offset by lower retirement benefit plan costs directly linked to our net income. Our employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages remained relatively consistent at 37.3% in 2024 compared to 37.5% in 2023.\n\nIn preparing our financial statements, we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These critical accounting policies, which are those that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, are further described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nRevenue per day decreased 4.2% in January 2025 compared to the same month last year. LTL tons per day decreased 7.1%, due primarily to a 5.4% decrease in LTL shipments per day and a 1.7% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 3.1% as compared to the same month last year. LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 4.5% as compared to the same month last year.\n\nSalaries, wages, and benefits increased $59.6 million, or 2.3%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, due to a $46.1 million increase in salaries and wages and a $13.5 million increase in employee benefit costs. The increase in salaries and wages was due primarily to the annual wage increase provided to our employees at the beginning of both September 2023 and 2024.\n\nAt our option, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either: (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus the Term SOFR Adjustment, as defined in the Credit Agreement, equal to 0.100%, plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.000% to 1.375%; or (ii) a Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus an applicable margin that ranges from 0.000% to 0.375%. The applicable margin for each of the foregoing options is dependent upon our consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio. Letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for SOFR loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter. Commitment fees ranging from 0.090% to 0.175% (based upon our consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio) are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the Credit Agreement.\n\nWe regularly upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs. Our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network, increases the productivity of our workforce, and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes.\n\nThe change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2024 as compared to 2023 was due primarily to the $139.5 million increase in certain other working capital accounts partially offset by the $53.4 million decrease in net income.\n\nOur capital expenditures vary based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities necessary to support our plan for long-term growth, our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle, and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth. Expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the geographic areas where we are looking to expand. We historically spend 10% to 15% of our revenue on capital expenditures each year, and we generally expect to continue to maintain a level of capital expenditures in order to support our long-term plan for market share growth. There could be years, however, where our annual capital expenditures plan is above or below this range as we balance the size of our service center network and operating fleet with anticipated growth.\n\nsuccess in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio, a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue, which also allows for industry-wide comparisons with our competition.\n\nAverage Length of Haul\n- We consider lengths of haul less than 500 miles to be regional traffic, lengths of haul between 500 miles and 1,000 miles to be inter-regional traffic, and lengths of haul in excess of 1,000 miles to be national traffic. This metric is used to analyze our tonnage and pricing trends for shipments with similar characteristics, and also allows for comparison with other transportation providers serving specific markets. By analyzing this metric, we can determine the success and growth potential of our service products in these markets. Changes in length of haul generally have a direct effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as an increase in length of haul will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight.\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nLTL Revenue Per Hundredweight\n- Our LTL transportation services are generally priced based on weight, commodity, and distance. This measurement reflects the application of our pricing policies to the services we provide, which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth objectives. Generally, freight is rated by a class system, which is established by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association, Inc. Light, bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per hundredweight than dense, heavy freight. Fuel surcharges, accessorial charges, revenue adjustments and revenue for undelivered freight are included in this measurement, and we regularly monitor the components that impact our pricing. The fuel surcharge is generally designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of our petroleum-based products and is indexed to diesel fuel prices published by the U.S. Department of Energy, which reset each week. Revenue for undelivered freight is deferred for financial statement purposes in accordance with our revenue recognition policy; however, we believe including it in our revenue per hundredweight metrics results in a more accurate representation of the underlying changes in our yields by matching total billed revenue with the corresponding weight of those shipments.\n\nOn May 28, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “ASR Agreement”) with a third-party financial institution. The ASR Agreement was accounted for as a settled treasury stock purchase and a forward stock purchase contract. The par value of the initial shares received was recorded as a reduction to common stock, with the excess purchase price recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. The forward stock purchase contract was accounted for as a contract indexed to our own stock and is classified within capital in excess of par value on our Balance Sheets. The ASR Agreement was settled with the final number of shares received based on the daily volume-weighted average share price of our common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. Under the ASR Agreement, we paid the third-party financial institution $200.0 million and received an initial delivery of 923,201 shares of our common stock for $160.0 million, representing approximately 80% of the total value of shares to be received by us under the ASR Agreement, and the remaining balance of $40.0 million was settled in November 2024. We repurchased a total of 1,056,213 shares for $200.0 million under the ASR Agreement.\n\nThe change in our cash flows used in financing activities during 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock, as well as an increase in dividend payments to our shareholders during 2024. Our return of capital to shareholders is more fully described below under “Stock Repurchase Program” and “Dividends to Shareholders.” Our long-term debt agreement is more fully described below under “Financing Arrangements.”\n\nThe change in our cash flows used in investing activities during 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to the timing of purchases and maturities of short-term investments and an increase in expenditures under our 2024 capital expenditure program. Additionally, we had lower proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in 2024 as compared to 2023. Changes in our capital expenditures a",
