Differences between the reportable segments’ results and Aon’s consolidated results include certain inter-segment revenues, as well as unallocated expenses. Prior period comparative segment information has been recast to conform with current year presentation, which reflects the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors our reportable operating segment performance.

We partner with clients leveraging our expertise and scale to help them effectively manage their investment portfolio.\nRevenue and Compensation\nOur business generates revenues primarily through commissions, compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies for services we provide to them, and fees from customers. Commissions and fees for brokerage services vary depending upon several factors, which may include the amount of premium, the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular services provided to a client, insurer, or reinsurer, and the capacity in which we act. Compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies includes: (1) fees for consulting and analytics services, and (2) fees and commissions for administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers and reinsurers. Fees from clients for advice and consulting services are dependent on the extent and value of the services we provide. Payment terms are consistent with current industry practices.\nFunds Held on Behalf of Clients\nWe typically hold funds on behalf of clients, including premiums received from clients and claims due to clients that are in transit to and from insurers. Certain funds held on behalf of clients are invested in interest-bearing premium trust accounts and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect and remit cash. The principal is segregated and not available for general operating purposes, although we may earn interest on these accounts.\nOur business operates in a highly competitive and fragmented environment. We compete with numerous other global insurance brokers and consulting companies, including, among others, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J Gallagher & Company, and Lockton Companies, Inc., as well as numerous other global, regional, and local firms in almost every area of our business. We also compete with insurance and reinsurance companies that directly market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents. Additionally, we compete with other businesses that do not fall into the categories above, including large financial institutions and independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, human resources, and financial services firms.\nDue to buying patterns and delivery of certain products and services in the markets we serve, revenues recognized tend to be higher in the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year.\nLicensing and Regulation\nOur business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate, including U.S. federal and state laws. See the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.\nRegulatory authorities in the U.S. and most other countries in which our operating subsidiaries conduct business may require individuals, entities, and related service providers to obtain a license from a government agency, including (but not limited to) licenses to operate as insurance producers, brokers, agents, consultants, reinsurance brokers, or managing general agents.\nCertain jurisdictions issue licenses only to resident entities or individuals. In such jurisdictions, if the Company has no licensed subsidiary, we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction. Such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process",

Through our experience, global reach, and comprehensive analytics, we help clients meet rapidly changing, increasingly complex, and interconnected challenges related to risk and people. We are committed to accelerating innovation to address unmet and evolving client needs so that our clients are better informed, better advised, and able to make better decisions to protect and grow their business. Management remains focused on strengthening Aon and uniting the firm with a portfolio of Risk Capital and Human Capital capabilities enabled by data and analytics and a united operating model to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency.\nThe following is a summary of our 2024 financial results:\nRevenue increased $2.3 billion\ng acquired revenues from NFP and 6% organic revenue growth, driven by net new business and ongoing strong retention. Risk Capital revenue increased $1.0 billion, or 10%, to $10.5 billion and Human Capital revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 35%\nOperating expenses increased $2.3 billion, or 24%, to $11.9 billion in\ndue primarily to the inclusion of NFP’s operating expenses, an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth, Accelerating Aon United restructuring charges, and transaction and integration costs, partially offset by $110 million of restructuring savings. Risk Capital operating expenses increased\n, or 10%, to $7.2 billion\nand Human Capital operating expenses\nincreased $1.3 billion, or 47%, to $4.1 billion in 2024 compared to 2023.\nOperating margin decreased to 24.4% in 2024 from 28.3% in 2023, driven primarily by the addition of NFP and an increase in operating expenses as previously described, partially offset by organic revenue growth of\n6% and $110 million of net restructuring savings\nRisk Capital operating margin increased to 31.3% in 2024 from 30.9% in 2023 and Human Capital operating margin decreased to 21.9% in 2024 from 28.4% in 2023.\nDue to the factors set forth above, Net income was $2.7 billion in 2024, an increase of $92 million, or 4%, from 2023.\nDiluted earnings per share was $12.49 per share in 2024 compared to $12.51 per share in the prior year period.\nCash flows provided by operating activities was $3.0 billion in 2024, a decrease of $400 million, or 12%, from $3.4 billion in 2023, primarily due to higher cash taxes, payments related to restructuring, legal settlement expenses, and transaction and integration costs, partially offset by strong adjusted operating income growth and working capital improvements.\nWe focus on four key metrics, that are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics for 2024:\nOrganic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth,” was 6% in 2024, compared to 7% organic growth in the prior year period, driven by net new business and ongoing strong retention.\nAdjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 31.5% in 2024, compared to 31.6% in the prior year. The decrease in adjusted operating margin primarily reflects the addition of NFP and increased expenses, partially offset by 6% organic revenue growth and $110 million of net restructuring savings. Risk Capital adju\nsted operating margin\nin 2023 and Human Capital adjusted operating margin\ndecreased to 29.5% in\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $15.60 per share in 2024, an increase of $1.46 per share, or 10%, from $14.14 per share in 2023.\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $2.8 billion in 2024, a decrease of $366 million, or 11%, from $3.2 billion in 2023, reflecting a decrease in Cash flows from operations, partially offset by a $34 million decrease in capital expenditures.\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE\nFor many companies, the management of ESG risks and opportunities has become increasingly important, and ESG-related challenges, such as extreme weather events, supply chain disruptions, cyber events, regulatory changes, ongoing public health impacts, and the increased focus on workforce resilience in various work environments, continue to create volatility and uncertainty for our clients. At Aon, helping clients manage risk - including ESG risk - is at the core of what we do. We offer a wide range of risk assessment, consulting, and advisory solutions, many of which are significant parts of our core business offerings, designed to address and manage ESG issues for clients, and to enable our clients to create more sustainable value. We see significant opportunity in enhancing our impact and delivering innovative client solutions on ESG matters.\nACQUISITION OF NFP\nOn April 25, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of NFP, a leading middle-market provider of property and casualty brokerage, benefits consulting, wealth management, and retirement plan consulting, with more than 7,700 colleagues. The Company acquired NFP Intermediate Holdings A Corp in a cash-and-stock merger for an aggregate U.S. GAAP preliminary purchase price totaling $9.1 billion, including approximately $3.2 billion to settle NFP indebtedness and cash consideration to the selling shareholders, and approximately 19 million class A ordinary shares with a fair value of approximately $5.9 billion, based on the Company’s closing stock price on April 25, 2024. In addition, the company had other adjustments of $3.9 billion for cash and certain assumed liabilities.\nREVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nOur consolidated results are as follows (in millions):\nYears Ended December 31\n\na non-recurring charge in connection with certain settlement expenses in the prior year period.\nAccelerating Aon United Program Expenses\nAccelerating Aon United Program expenses were $389 million in 2024 compared to $135 million in 2023, reflecting restructuring charges associated with the AAU Program announced in the third quarter of 2023, relating to workforce optimization, technology and other costs, and asset impairments.\nTotal Operating Expenses and Operating Income\nTotal operating expenses increased $2.3 billion, or 24%, to $11.9 billion in\ndue primarily to the inclusion of NFP’s operating expenses, an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth, Accelerating Aon United restructuring charges, and transaction and integration costs, partially offset by $110 million of restructuring savings.\nDue to the factors set forth above, Total operating income increased\nRisk Capital Total operating expenses increased $647 million, or 10% to $7.2 billion in 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Compensation and benefits and an increase in Other expenses. The increase in Compensation and benefits is due to the inclusion of operating expenses from NFP and an increase in expense associated with 5% and 7% organic revenue growth in Commercial Risk Solutions and Reinsurance Solutions, respectively, partially offset by restructuring savings. The increase in Other expenses is primarily due to increased Amortization and impairment from the NFP Transaction and Accelerating Aon United restructuring charges. Due to the factors set forth above, Risk Capital operating income increased $346 million, or 12%, to $3.3 billion in 2024.\nHuman Capital Total operating expenses increased $1.3 billion, or 47% to $4.1 billion in 2024.

The increase in Compensation and benefits is due to the inclusion of operating expenses from NFP and an increase in expense associated with 6% and 7% organic revenue growth in Health Solutions and Wealth Solutions, respectively. The increase in Other expenses is primarily due to increased Amortization and impairment of intangible assets acquired from the NFP Transaction. Due to the factors set forth above, Human Capital operating income increased $46 million, or 4%, to $1.1 billion in 2024.\nInterest income represents income earned, net of expense, on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $67 million in 2024, an increase of $36 million, or 116%, from 2023, primarily reflecting interest earned on the investment of $5 billion of term debt proceeds, which were ultimately used to fund the acquisition of NFP.\nInterest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations, was $788 million in 2024, an increase of $304 million, or 63%, from 2023. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in total debt outstanding, primarily to fund the acquisition of NFP.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income was $348 million in 2024, compared to Other expense of $163 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to gain on the sale of businesses.\nIncome before Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes increased $293 million, or 9% to $3.5 billion in 2024, compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year.\nThe effective tax rate on Net income was 21.4% in 2024 and 17.1% in 2023.\nThe 2024 tax rate was primarily driven by\nthe geographical distribution of income and certain discrete items, including the favorable impacts of share-based payments and the unfavorable impact of other discrete items.\nThe 2023 tax rate was primarily driven by\nthe geographical distribution of income and certain discrete items, including the tax benefits associated with the release of a valuation allowance, and share-based payments.\nIreland, the U.K., Singapore, and many E.U. member states, among others, have enacted legislation to implement the global minimum tax that is generally consistent with the OECD’s proposed Pillar Two tax regime. There remains significant uncertainty, however, as to how Pillar Two will ultimately apply to the Company. The OECD has issued numerous guidance documents attempting to change how Pillar Tax operates, subject to enactment by each implementing country, and the OECD may issue additional guidance in the future. The Company is actively monitoring developments in this area and continues to evaluate the guidance and the potential impacts this may have on its global effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in 2025 and future periods.\nNet Income Attributable to Aon Shareholders\nNet income attributable to Aon shareholders increased $90 million to $2.7 billion, or $12.49 per diluted share, in 2024, compared to $2.6 billion, or $12.51 per diluted share, in 2023.\nConsolidated and Segment Results for 2023 Compared to 2022\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nCorporate/Eliminations\nCompensation and benefits\nInformation technology\nTotal operating expenses\nSegment expenses exclude governance costs, post-retirement benefits, and other costs that are not directly attributable to a specific segment.\nIncludes expenses related to Depreciation of fixed assets, Amortization and impairment of intangible assets, Accelerating Aon United Program expenses, and Other general expenses.\nTotal revenue increased $897 million, or 7%, to $13.4 billion in 2023, compared to $12.5 billion in 2022.

Risk Capital revenue increased $619 million, or 7%, to $9.5 billion and Human Capital revenue increased $273 million, or 8%, to $3.9 billion.\nCommercial Risk Solutions\nrevenue increased $328 million, or 5%, to $7.0 billion in 2023, compared to $6.7 billion in 2022. Organic revenue growth was 5% in 2023, reflecting growth across all major geographies, driven by strong retention, management of the renewal book, and net new business generation. Growth in retail brokerage was highlighted by double-digit growth in Asia and the Pacific, driven by continued strength in core P&C. The U.S. grew modestly driven by strength in core areas of property, casualty, and construction, partially offset by the impact of external M&A and IPO activity. On average globally, exposures and pricing were positive, resulting in modestly positive market impact.\nReinsurance Solutions\nrevenue increased $291 million, or 13%, to $2.5 billion in 2023, compared to $2.2 billion in 2022.

Organic revenue growth was 4% in 2023 reflecting growth in Retirement, driven by advisory demand and project-related work related to pension de-risking and ongoing impact of regulatory changes. In Investments, a decrease in AUM-based delegated investment management revenue due to debt and equity market movements was partially offset by higher advisory demand and project- related work.\nTotal Operating Expenses and Operating Income\nTotal operating expenses\n\nA-\nA-2\nMoody’s Investor Services\nP-2\nBBB+\nF-2\nLetters of Credit and Other Guarantees\nWe have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit.
