  "item2_clean": "Russia and Ukraine Conflict\nWe had $241 million and $162 million of assets in, or directly related to, Russia and Ukraine as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, none of which are subject to sanctions that impact the carrying value of the assets. We generated revenues of $209 million and $243 million from customers in these two countries for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The potential inability to repatriate earnings from these two countries will not have a material impact on our ability to operate.\nWe continue to monitor the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including the consideration of financial impact, cybersecurity risks, the applicability and effect of sanctions, and the employee base in Ukraine and Russia. Under the current U.S. Department of Commerce regulations, we are permitted to export, re-export, or transfer medical equipment and spare parts that meet stated criteria under a License Exception, which has eliminated the need for us to obtain individual U.S. licenses in most cases; however, licenses still may be needed for some transactions. The European Union and other countries have also expanded licensing requirements for certain spare parts, services, software, and other items. We will continue to apply for licenses to supply to these customers and to support our business in Russia, as required. The implementation of these measures affected our ability to supply customers in Russia during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 and will continue to do so as we confirm applicability of the U.S. License Exception to our transactions and continue to obtain licenses. There is no guarantee we will obtain all of the licenses for which we applied, that any approvals we obtain will be on a timely basis, or that our business in Russia will not be further disrupted due to evolving legal or operational considerations. We will continue to assess whether developments related to the conflict have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on the Company.\nGeopolitical Conflicts\nGeopolitical instability, including recent conflicts in the Middle East, could adversely impact our operations, supply chains, and logistics. These events may result in increased costs, delays in product deliveries, and challenges in maintaining service levels in affected areas. While these events have not materially impacted our operations, we continue to monitor these developments closely.\nRecent U.S. Legislation\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into U.S. law, which includes, among other things, significant changes to the federal income tax system, as well as U.S. healthcare policy. While the changes did not have a material impact to the Company’s tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2025, we continue to evaluate the non-income tax impacts on our business.\nSUMMARY OF KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nManagement reviews and analyzes several key performance measures including Total revenues, Operating income, Net income attributable to GE HealthCare, Earnings per share, and Cash from (used for) operating activities. Management also reviews and analyzes Organic revenue*, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes* (“Adjusted EBIT*”), Adjusted net income*, Adjusted tax expense*, Adjusted effective tax rate* (“Adjusted ETR*”), Adjusted earnings per share*, and Free cash flow*, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are reviewed and analyzed in order to evaluate our business performance, identify trends affecting our business, allocate capital, and make strategic decisions, including those discussed below. See “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion on our key performance measures.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures, a discussion of why we believe they are useful to management and investors as well as certain of their limitations, and reconciliations to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures are provided below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n____________________\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n\nOn January 3, 2023, General Electric Company, which now operates as GE Aerospace (“GE”), completed the spin-off of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (the “Spin-Off”).\nThe following tables are presented in millions of United States (“U.S.”) dollars unless otherwise stated, except for per-share amounts which are presented in U.S. dollars. Certain columns and rows may not sum due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and, unless otherwise stated, represent changes year-over-year.\nGE HealthCare’s operations are organized and managed through four reportable segments: Imaging, Advanced Visualization Solutions (“AVS”), Patient Care Solutions (“PCS”), and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics (“PDx”), and we assessed their performance using Segment revenues and Segment EBIT. For additional information on our segments, refer to Note 3, “Segment Information.”\nTRENDS AND FACTORS IMPACTING OUR PERFORMANCE\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and particularly in Item 1A,\n\nKEY TRENDS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nGlobal Trade and Macroeconomic Environment\nThroughout 2025, the U.S. has imposed a variety of new tariffs on most imports from all countries in the world. This in turn prompted several countries to announce tariffs on U.S. imports. While the situation continues to be fluid, tariffs materially impacted our current year profitability and cash flows, primarily the bilateral U.S. and Chinese tariffs and U.S. tariffs on all other global import suppliers. Should the tariffs continue at formally communicated levels, we expect to continue to see a material impact to our financial results through the incurrence of additional costs. Additional tariffs or other trade restrictions by the U.S. or other countries where we do significant business, or other restrictions on specific industries, such as pharmaceuticals, could further materially impact our results in the future. While we are taking actions to mitigate the impact of tariffs, we do not expect to be able to fully offset the additional costs or other negative impacts resulting from the tariffs.\nWe continue to monitor the global markets in which we operate for changes in customer behavior, changes in government spending and reimbursement, and indirect impacts from the tariffs. Should these factors dampen economic growth, slow global trade, or impact inflation, we could see adverse impacts to our business as our customers adapt to the change in economic environment. We continue to monitor potential impacts on purchasing decisions by both public and private customers in China and other markets as a result of the current trade environment, as well as other actions related to tariffs and trade frictions, investigations, or activities that could similarly increase our costs or otherwise impact our business. In addition, if negative sentiment towards U.S. companies influences the purchasing decisions of global customers, our business could be impacted materially.\nWe continue to monitor developments in the market in China. In March 2024, the government in China announced a stimulus program (“2024 stimulus”) that includes the healthcare sector and is being implemented through China’s provinces. We expect the 2024 stimulus program will result in opportunities for our business in China in the longer term, but it has had short-term impacts as provinces develop and announce their plans and customers begin to make purchasing decisions, which has progressed slower than originally anticipated. We expect these delays to continue to impact our orders and revenues in the near term, although we are unable to predict the exact duration or magnitude of the impact. We believe the focus of government policy in China on expanding access to healthcare should benefit our business in China in the long term.\n\nwas $1,441 million, an increase of $48 million primarily due to lower Interest and other financial charges – net and lower Provision for income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in operating income when excluding the impact of lower Spin-Off and separation costs.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSEGMENTS\nWe exclude from Segment EBIT certain corporate-related expenses and certain transactions or adjustments that our Chief Operating Decision Maker (which is our Chief Executive Officer) considers to be non-operational, such as Interest and other financial charges – net, Benefit (provision) for income taxes, restructuring costs, acquisition and disposition-related benefits (charges), Spin-Off and separation costs, Non-operating benefit (income) costs, gain (loss) on business and asset dispositions, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, and investment revaluation gain (loss).
