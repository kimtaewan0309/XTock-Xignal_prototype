Founded and operating in San Jose, California, we are committed to delivering first-to-market innovation for Enterprise, Cloud, AI, and 5G Telco/Edge IT Infrastructure. As a Total IT Solutions manufacturer, our offerings include server, artificial intelligence (“AI”) systems, storage, IoT devices, switches, software, and support services. Supermicro's expertise in motherboard, power, and chassis design drives our ability to develop and produce next-generation innovations, from cloud to edge, for our global customers. Our products are designed and manufactured in-house across facilities in the United States, Taiwan, and the Netherlands. Leveraging our global operations for scale and efficiency, we optimize solutions to improve TCO while reducing environmental impact through Green Computing initiatives. Our award-winning portfolio of Server Building Block Solutions empowers customers to tailor systems precisely to their exact workloads and applications. By selecting from a broad family of flexible and reusable building blocks, customers can configure a comprehensive range of form factors, processors, memory, GPUs, storage, networking, power, and cooling solutions, including air-conditioned, free air, and liquid cooling solutions.\nWe commenced operations in 1993 and have been profitable every year since inception. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, our net income was $168.3 million and $424.3 million, respectively.\nIn order to increase our sales and profits, we believe that we must continue to develop flexible application optimized server and storage solutions while being among the first to market with new features and products. Our focus is on delivering Total IT Solutions that integrate, validate, and deliver server, storage, networking and software at the rack and cluster (multi-rack) level. Additionally, we will continue to expand our software offerings and enhance customer service and support, particularly as we increase our focus on large enterprise and data center customers. A key component of our strategy is our DCBBS, which significantly reduces data center build time and enables full integration of AI computing, server, storage, networking, rack, cabling, liquid cooling, end-to-end management software, onsite deployment services, and ongoing maintenance. To further expand our market share, we also recognize the need to strengthen our network of sales partners and distribution channels.\nWe measure our financial success based on various key indicators, including growth in net sales, gross profit margin, operating margin, and net income per common share. In addition to these financial metrics, a critical non-financial indicator of our success is our ability to rapidly introduce new products and deliver the latest application-optimized server and storage solutions. To support this, we work closely with the developers and manufacturers of key components, allowing us to integrate emerging technologies as they become available. Our ability to quickly bring new products to market, which we believe is enabled by our Building Block Solution architecture and has historically enabled us to capitalize on major technology transitions such as the launch of new GPUs, microprocessors and storage technologies. Accordingly, we closely monitor the product introduction cycles of industry leaders, including NVIDIA Corporation, Intel Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Broadcom Inc., Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Micron Technology, Inc. and others. This strategic focus directly informs our research and development investments, as we continue to allocate resources toward both our current initiatives and future product innovation.\nThe growing use of AI, which requires enhanced datacenter capabilities, has substantially increased demand for our products. We expect this trend to continue, with further demand for datacenter expansion driven by the AI market. As a result, we will continue to enhance our product capabilities and expand our service offerings, including DCBBS to address the growing demand in the AI market and datacenter markets. We believe that our ability to tailor certain products to the unique needs of these sectors sets us apart from many competitors and positions us to capture an even greater market share going forward.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, tariffs, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have had and may continue to have direct and indirect impacts on our business and results of operations, particularly demand for our products and net sales. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors have also impacted and may continue to impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments. Further, while many of these macroeconomic factors could have a long term impact, others may have a short term impact which could lead to our financial results not being comparable on a period-to-period basis.\nFinancial Highlights\nThe following is a summary of our financial highlights for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nTotal operating expenses\nIncome from operations\nNet income per diluted share\nNet sales decreased by 15.5% in the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the timing of several substantial customer orders received only in late September, which prevented the related GPU and SuperRack products from being shipped within the quarter. The decrease also reflects changes in product mix and a modest reduction in average selling prices as we continued to price our products competitively.\nGross margin decreased to 9.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2025 from 13.1% in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to our strategy to offer competitive pricing to gain market share, change in product and customer mix, and higher manufacturing related expenses.\nOperating expenses increased by 7.0% in the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher headcount and increases in salary and stock-based compensation.\nNet income decreased to $168.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $424.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to decrease in gross profit and increase in operating and other expenses.\n\n*Represents an amount less than 0.1%.\nThe following table presents net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\n15.5% decrease in net sales was primarily due to the timing of several substantial orders, which were only received in late September, such that the products covered by those orders could not be shipped during the quarter ended September 30, 2025. This was caused principally by customer configuration upgrades and delays in data center readiness. A decrease in our average selling price compared to the prior quarter ended September 30, 2024 also contributed modestly to the decline in net sales of server and storage systems, as we maintained our strategy of pricing our products competitively to retain and or gain market shares. This was most pronounced in declining billings for GPU & Super Racks of $527.8 million or 11.7% year over year, including liquid-cooled and air-cooled servers that are generally more complex and of higher average selling price. Additionally, sales across other product categories decreased by $349.9 million, or 28.5%, including Traditional Storage, SuperBlade, Ultra Server, and other product lines.\nNets Sales by Geography\nfollowing table presents net sales by geographic region for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nPercentage of total net sales\nPercentage of total net sales\nPercentage of total net sales\nPercentage of total net sales\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nThe $919.5 million or 15.5% decrease in total net sales was primarily driven by the timing of several substantial customer orders that were received only in late September, which prevented the related products including GPU servers, HPC systems, and rack-scale solutions, which generally have higher average selling prices, from being shipped during the quarter ended September 30, 2025. This was caused principally by customer configuration upgrades and delays in data center readiness. The decrease also reflects a shift in product mix and a modest reduction in average selling prices as we continued to price our products competitively to retain and gain market share. This impact was most notable in the United States, where net sales decreased by $2,406.8 million, or 56.7%, compared to the prior quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nCost of Sales, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin\nCost of sales and gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nThe $611.3 million or 11.8% decrease in cost of sales was primarily driven by a net decrease of approximately $754.5 million or 14.1% in certain products including GPU servers, HPC, and rack-scale solutions, consistent with the lower shipment volume during the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from the timing of several substantial orders that were received "
