Our competitors include a broad range of financial institutions and servicing companies, including other custodial banks, deposit-taking institutions, investment management firms, insurance companies, mutual funds, broker/dealers, investment banks, benefits consultants, investment analytics businesses, business service and software companies, technology companies, data providers and information services firms. As our businesses grow and markets evolve, we may encounter increasing and new forms of competition around the world.\nWe believe that many key factors drive competition in the markets for our business. Technological expertise, economies of scale, required levels of capital, pricing, quality and scope of services, and sales and marketing are critical to our Investment Servicing line of business. For our Investment Management line of business, key competitive factors include expertise, experience, availability of related service offerings, quality of service, price, efficiency of our products and services, and performance.\nOur success and competitive position may depend on our ability to develop and market new and\ninnovative services, to adopt or develop new technologies, including those incorporating artificial intelligence, to implement efficiencies into our operational processes, to bring new services to market in a timely fashion at competitive prices, to integrate existing and future products and services effectively into State Street Alpha and State Street Digital, to continue to expand our relationships with existing clients and to attract new clients, to maintain and enhance our reputation, to manage risk and to effectively and efficiently operate in a highly regulated environment.\nAs a G-SIB, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision with respect to our operations and activities. Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company; therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same limitations, requirements and standards with respect to their operations and activities. Most other financial institutions designated as systemically important have substantially greater financial resources and a broader base of operations than we do and are, consequently, in a better competitive position to manage and bear the costs of this enhanced regulatory requirement. See “Supervision and Regulation” in this Item for more information.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nOur human capital strategy is a meaningful driver of our overall enterprise strategy and our long-term performance. Our employees drive the company’s value proposition, innovate better ways to serve our clients and act as custodians of our reputation. We seek to empower our employees by providing development and learning opportunities to help each person reach their full potential. The Board of Directors’ Human Resources Committee oversees our human capital management strategy and receives regular updates on matters such as engagement, culture, talent management, retention and productivity.\nWe aim to promote strong levels of employee commitment and connection to the company by providing an environment that supports our diverse employee population in amplifying behaviors that drive our business strategy. We believe that an inclusive culture where employees feel valued, engaged and empowered makes State Street a more desirable place to work, helps us attract and retain employees as they grow in their careers, and fosters an environment that enhances each individual’s sense of belonging, productivity and professional satisfaction.
