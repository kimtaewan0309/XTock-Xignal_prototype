TurboTax delivers do-it-yourself and assisted income tax preparation products and services sold in the United States (U.S.) and Canada. We offer a variety of money products directly to consumers, including early refund access to any bank, as well as Credit Karma Money branded savings and checking accounts through an FDIC-member bank partner.\nCredit Karma is a personal finance solution that helps members find the right financial products and make smarter money decisions throughout the year to reach their financial goals. This includes personalized recommendations for credit card, home, auto, and personal loan, and insurance products; and access to their credit scores and reports, credit and identity monitoring, credit report dispute, credit building tools, credit card rewards optimization, and connected account capabilities to help members understand net worth and make financial progress.\nFinally, our ProTax offerings help professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada.\nOur Business and Growth Strategy\nThe era of AI is igniting global innovations at an incredible pace and will fundamentally transform every part of our work and personal lives. We made an early bet on AI, declaring our AI-driven expert platform strategy in 2019. We have transformed the company from a tax and accounting platform to an AI-driven expert platform. We have a significant competitive advantage as we are creating a system of intelligence with our scale of data, data services, AI capabilities, ecosystem of applications, and our large network of AI-enabled human experts to become the all-in-one platform for consumers, businesses, and accountants. We're disrupting the categories we operate in to drive better money outcomes for our customers.\nWe leverage AI and human intelligence to provide our customers with done-for-you experiences that automate tasks, identify actionable insights to drive important decisions, and manage end-to-end workflows or entire processes to eliminate work, while ensuring the customer remains in control. When customers need additional help or want help to complete the work on their behalf, we connect them with the best human expert from our network of thousands of AI-enabled financial, tax, and bookkeeping experts who can complete a specific task, address specialized questions, or manage the entire workload. Our strategy, combined with our Big Bets that focus on the largest customer problems and growth opportunities, positions us for durable growth.\nWe launched a transformative set of AI agents that provide customers with a virtual team to complete jobs on their behalf, dramatically improving how businesses run and grow. Combined with our AI-enabled human experts, these agents are automating workflows and delivering real-time insights to drive growth and improve cash flow. Our redesigned user interface and new business feed highlights these real-time insights and recommendations and the tasks completed by agents on behalf of the customer. We also launched AI agents in Intuit Enterprise Suite, including accounting, payments, finance, and project management agents, transforming how our small and mid-market business customers manage their finances by automating a variety of day-to-day tasks, and increasing productivity.\nOur innovation has been possible with the investments in our proprietary Generative AI Operating System (GenOS), which have enabled us to fuel innovation with unparalleled speed for our customers. Built for our internal developers, GenOS not only keeps pace with rapid technological industry advances but is setting the pace—by melding the best of artificial intelligence and human intelligence on our platform. This enables us to rapidly deliver a new class of intelligent, autonomous financial solutions that will define the next decade of growth for our customers and for Intuit. Our AI-driven expert platform and products are built in keeping with the company’s commitment to data privacy, security, and responsible AI governance. We safeguard customer data and protect privacy using industry-leading technology and practices, and adhere to responsible AI principles that guide how we operate and scale our platform with our customers’ best interests in mind.\nAs we execute our global AI-driven expert platform strategy, we prioritize resources on Big Bets that solve the problems that matter most to our customers:\nDeliver done-for-you experiences\nWe will address our customers’ biggest pain points through a virtual team of AI agents and AI-enabled human experts that deliver done-for-you experiences, with customers in control. This means delivering done-for-you experiences to help businesses run and grow, from lead to cash, and fueling consumers’ financial success year-round, from credit building to wealth building.\nAccelerate Money Benefits\nWe will become the all-in-one platform for customers to manage their critical workflows, decisions, and money. For businesses, this means optimizing cash flow, including receivables, payables, capital, and spend management. For consumers, this means optimizing money and growing their savings, starting with fast access to their tax refund to help them manage cash flow year-round.\nFuel Success for Mid-Market Businesses\nWe will become the all-in-one solution for mid-market customers, fueling their success by offering a better experience, better price, and lower total cost of ownership. Businesses are overdigitized, juggling too many disparate apps. Our platform, including QuickBooks Advanced, Intuit Enterprise Suite, and our ecosystem of connected services, brings the data and insights they need all in one place to grow revenue and profit.\nAs the external environment evolves, we continue to innovate and adapt our strategy and anticipate our customers’ needs. For more than 40 years, we have been dedicated to developing innovative solutions that are designed to solve our customers' most important financial problems. At Intuit, we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to prosper, and we never stop working to find new, innovative ways to make that possible.\nIndustry Trends and Seasonality\nAI, including GenAI, predictive AI, and agentic AI, is transforming multiple industries, in particular financial technology. Disruptive start-ups, emerging ecosystems, and mega-platforms are harnessing new technology to create personalized experiences, deliver data-driven insights, and increase speed of service. These shifts are creating a more dynamic and highly competitive environment where customer expectations are shifting around the world as more services become digitized and the array of choices continues to increase.\nWithin our Consumer segment, our TurboTax and ProTax offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.\nWe expect the seasonality of these offerings to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.\nKey Challenges and Risks\nOur growth strategy depends upon our ability to innovate, develop, and introduce emerging technologies, including AI and GenAI, to drive broad adoption of our products and services and enter new markets. Our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our third-party business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and strengthen new and existing relationships. To remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Much of our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and develop highly skilled employees, including those\nin technical and leadership roles who are critical to our strategic growth, in a highly competitive talent environment.\nAs we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.\nWe operate in industries that are experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by malicious third parties, and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated, including through the use of AI. We continue to invest and implement additional security measures. We work with state and federal governments to implement industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures, including sharing information regarding suspicious activity. We also work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.\nOur operations are impacted by a rapidly-evolving regulatory environment and face increasingly heightened scrutiny. We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a broad and increasing range of subjects, both in the U.S. and intern"
