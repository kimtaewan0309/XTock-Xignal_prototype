We sell and service our products through a combination of direct sales and service personnel and a network of independent distributors and sales representatives. We operate in four segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health.\nThrough our Diagnostics segment, we offer a wide range of diagnostic products, which are used primarily to aid in the screening and diagnosis of human diseases. Our primary Diagnostics products include our molecular diagnostic assays, which run on our advanced instrumentation systems (Panther and Panther Fusion), our cytology systems, including the ThinPrep System, and the Genius Digital Diagnostics System, and the Rapid fFN Test. Our Aptima family of molecular diagnostic assays is used to detect, among other things, the infectious microorganisms that cause common sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, or CT/NG; certain high-risk strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV;\nTrichomonas vaginalis\n, the parasite that causes trichomoniasis; Mycoplasma genitalium; and Herpes Simplex viruses 1 and 2. We also offer viral load tests for the quantitation of Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV-1, and human cytomegalo virus, or CMV, for use on our Panther instrument system. In addition, we offer bacterial vaginosis and candida vaginitis assays, or BV/CV, for the diagnosis of vaginitis, a common and complex ailment affecting millions of women a year. Our assay portfolio also includes diagnostic tests for a range of acute respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2, various strains of influenza and parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as a test for the detection of Group B Streptococcus, or GBS, as well as two assays that detect several bacterial gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens that commonly cause acute gastroenteritis; all of which are run on the Panther Fusion system, a field upgradeable instrument addition to the base Panther system. We also offer two CE-marked molecular assays, the Panther Fusion EBV Quant assay for quantitation of Epstein-Barr virus, and the Panther Fusion BKV Quant assay for quantitation of the BK virus. These two assays are the first quantitative real-time PCR assays on the Panther Fusion system, and, together with the Aptima CMV Quant assay, comprise our menu of transplant monitoring assays. The ThinPrep System and the Genius Digital Diagnostics System are primarily used in cytology applications, such as cervical cancer screening, and the Rapid fFN Test assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre-term birth. We also generate service revenues from our CLIA-certified laboratory for testing related to breast cancer using our Breast Cancer Index or BCI test. The open access functionality on the Panther Fusion system allows customers to consolidate lab developed tests (LDTs) and in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on the same fully-automated, sample-to-result system.\nOur Breast Health segment offers a broad portfolio of solutions for breast imaging, biopsy, breast surgery and pathology. These solutions include 3D digital mammography systems, image analysis software utilizing artificial intelligence, reading workstations, minimally invasive breast biopsy guidance systems, breast biopsy site markers, localization, and specimen radiology systems. Our most advanced breast imaging platforms, Selenia Dimensions and 3Dimensions systems, utilize tomosynthesis to produce 3D images that show multiple contiguous slice images of the breast.\nOur GYN Surgical products include our MyoSure hysteroscopic tissue removal system, our NovaSure endometrial ablation system, our Fluent fluid management system, our Sonata transcervical radiofrequency ablation system, our Acessa ProVu laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation system, and our CoolSeal vessel sealing portfolio and our JustRight surgical stapler. The MyoSure suite of devices offers four options to provide incision-less removal of fibroids, polyps, and other pathology within the uterus. The NovaSure portfolio is comprised of the NovaSure ADVANCED device and the NovaSure V5 device for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. The Fluent and Fluent Pro fluid management systems provide liquid distention during diagnostic and operative hysteroscopic procedures. The Sonata system uses transcervical, intrauterine ultrasound guidance to treat a wide range of fibroid types without the need for incisions. The Acessa ProVu system is a fully integrated system that uses laparoscopic ultrasound, guidance mapping and radiofrequency ablation to treat nearly all types of fibroids. The CoolSeal portfolio includes the CoolSeal Trinity, CoolSeal Reveal, and CoolSeal Mini advanced bipolar vessel sealing devices. The JustRight 5 mm stapler features a smaller instrument profile and is used for laparoscopic general and pediatric surgery.\nOur Skeletal Health segment’s products include the Horizon DXA, a dual energy x-ray system, which evaluates bone density and performs body composition assessments, and the Fluoroscan Insight FD mini C-arm, which assists in performing minimally invasive orthopedic surgical procedures on a patient’s extremities, such as the hand, wrist, knee, foot, and ankle. Effective in fiscal 2026, we are discontinuing the sale of our Fluoroscan Insight FD systems.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, references to “we”, “us”, “Hologic” or “the Company” refer to Hologic, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAvailable Information\nOur internet website address is\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website (\ninvestors.hologic.com\n), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts.

  "item7_clean": "Segment Operating Loss\nOperating Loss as a % of Segment Revenue\nSkeletal Health revenues increased in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to an increase in product revenues discussed above.\nOperating loss increased in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to a decrease in gross profit as discussed above under cost of product revenues, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to a decrease in marketing and research and development expenses.\nFiscal Year Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt September 27, 2025, we had working capital of $2,690.9 million, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,959.5 million. Our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by $200.7 million during fiscal 2025 principally due to cash used in investing and financing activities primarily related to repurchases of our common stock, cash paid to acquire Gynesonics, capital expenditures and strategic investments, partially offset by cash generated from operating activities and net maturities of available-for-sale securities.\nIn fiscal 2025, our operating activities provided cash of $1,057.1 million, primarily due to net income of $565.7 million, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization aggregating $299.8 million, intangible asset impairments of $225.9 million and stock-based compensation expense of $84.3 million. These adjustments to net income were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred taxes of $141.6 million primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets and impairments of acquired intangible assets recorded in the second quarter in fiscal 2025. Cash provided by operations included a net cash outflow of $20.4 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. This cash outflow was primarily driven by a decrease of $32.3 in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to the payment of fiscal 2024 bonuses, which were higher than fiscal 2025 bonuses accrued, and normal operating lease payments, a decrease in accounts payable of $11.3 million primarily due to the timing of payments, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $15.3 million primarily due to a reduction of capital equipment sales deferred for acceptance in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. These cash outflows were partially offset by a decrease in prepaid income taxes of $20.1 million primarily due to the timing of tax payments relative to the provision for income taxes and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $11.9 million primarily due to normal amortization and a decrease in service and software subscriptions.\nIn fiscal 2025, our investing activities used cash of $482.7 million primarily due to a $321.5 million net payment for the Gynesonics acquisition, capital expenditures of $137.0 million, which primarily consisted of the placement of equipment under customer usage agreements and purchase of manufacturing equipment, $35.0 million for strategic investments and $15.4 million for the purchases of an intellectual property license. These cash outflows were partially offset by $29.1 million of net maturities of available-for-sale securities.\nIn fiscal 2025, our financing activities used cash of $777.2 million, primarily due to $752.9 million for repurchases of our common stock, including a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, $28.5 million for debt principal payments under our 2021 Credit Agreements, and $22.2 million for the payment of employee taxes withheld for the net share settlement of vested restricted stock units. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds of $38.8 million from our equity plans from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan.\nWe had total recorded debt outstanding of $2.51 billion at September 27, 2025, which was comprised of amounts outstanding under our 2025 Credit Agreement of $1.167 billion (principal of $1.169 billion), 2029 Senior Notes of $942.9 million (principal of $950.0 million), and 2028 Senior Notes of $398.3 million (principal of $400.0 million).\n2025 Credit Agreement\nOn July 15, 2025, we refinanced our existing 2021 Term Loan and 2021 Revolver with Bank of America, N.A. in its capacity as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and certain other lenders from time to time party thereto (the “2021 Credit Agreement”) by entering into Refinancing Amendment (the “2025 Credit Agreement”). Borrowings under the 2025 Credit Agreement are secured by first-priority liens on, and a first priority security interest in, substantially all of our and our Subsidiary Guarantors’ U.S. assets. The credit facilities (the “2025 Credit Facilities”) under the 2025 Credit Agreement consist of:\nA $1.169 billion secured term loan (“2025 Term Loan”) with a stated maturity date of July 15, 2030; and\nA secured revolving credit facility (the “2025 Revolver”) under which the Borrowers may borrow up to $1.25 billion, subject to certain sublimits, with a stated maturity date of July 15, 2030.\nAs of September 27, 2025, there were no borrowings under the 2025 Revolver.\nBorrowings under the 2025 Credit Agreement, other than Swing Line Loans, bear interest, at the Company’s option, at the Base Rate, the Daily SOFR Rate, the Term SOFR Rate, the Alternative Currency Daily Rate, and the Alternative Currency Term Rate, in each case plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate with respect to the Base Rate, Daily SOFR Rate, Term SOFR Rate, the Alternative Currency Daily Rate and the Alternative Currency Term Rate is subject to specified changes depending on the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in Refinancing Amendment No.4). The Term Loan borrowings initially bear interest at an annual rate equal to Term SOFR Rate plus 1.10%. As of September 27, 2025, the interest rate under the 2025 Term Loan was 5.26% per annum.\nWe are required to make scheduled principal payments under the 2025 Term Loan in increasing amounts, which currently range from $2.92 million per three-month period to $14.61 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on September 25, 2026. The remaining scheduled balance of $1.04 billion (or such lesser aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans then outstanding) on the 2025 Term Loan and any amounts outstanding under the 2025 Revolver are due at their respective maturities. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2025 Credit Agreement, we may be required to make certain mandatory prepayments from the net proceeds of specified types of asset sales (subject to certain reinvestment rights), debt issuances (excluding permitted debt) and insurance recoveries (subject to certain reinvestment rights). Certain mandatory prepayments are subject to reduction or elimination if certain financial covenants are met. Subject to certain limitations, we may voluntarily prepay any of the 2025 Credit Facilities without premium or penalty.\nThe 2025 Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities including the requirement we maintain two financial covenants (a total net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio) measured as of the last day of each quarter for the previous twelve-month period. These covenants are consistent with those under the 2021 Credit Agreement, and we were in compliance with these covenants as of September 27, 2025.\nThe total aggregate principal balance of the 2028 Senior Notes is $400.0 million. The 2028 Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. The 2028 Senior Notes mature on February 1, 2028 and bear interest at the rate of 4.625% per year, payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. We have the option to redeem the 2028 Senior Notes on or after: February 1, 2025 through February 1, 2026 at 100.770% of par; and February 1, 2026 and thereafter at 100% of par. In addition, if there is a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2028 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.\nThe total aggregate principal balance of the 2029 Senior Notes is $950.0 million. The 2029 Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain domestic subsidiaries. The 2029 Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2029 and bear interest at the rate of 3.250% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. We have the option to redeem the 2029 Senior Notes on or after: September 28, 2025 and thereafter at 100% of par. In addition, if there is a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2029 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn September 12, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, with a five-year term, to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding stock. As of September 27, 2025, $937.5 million remained unused under this authorization.\nThe timing of any future share repurchases will be based upon our continuing analysis of market, financial, and other factors. Repurchases under the authorized share repurchase program may be made using a variety of methods, which may include, but are not limited to, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase agreements, or purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan under the Exchange Act. The authorized share repurchase program may be suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we are restricted from initiating share repurchases without the prior written consent of Blackstone and TPG.\nFuture Liquidity Considerations\nWe expect to continue to review and evaluate potential strategic transactions that we believe will complement our current or future business. Subject to the “Risk Factors” set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and the general disclaimers\nset forth in our Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the outset of this Annual Report, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and the cash available under our 2025 Revolver will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our existing commitments and our expected normal operations and debt payments over the next twelve months. Our longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. We may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, repayment of debt, acquisitions, strategic transactions or other investments. As described above, we have significant indebtedness outstanding under our 2025 Credit Agreement, 2028 Senior Notes, and 2029 Senior Notes. These capital requirements could be substantial. Our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above-referenced Risk Factors set forth elsewhere in this report. These risks, trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long-term liquidity.\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries and investigations arising out of the ordinary course of business. In connection with these legal proceedings, claims, inspections, inquiries or investigations, management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement, if any, of these proceedings. These estimates are developed, as applicable in consultation with outside counsel, and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies. In accordance with ASC 450,\n, loss contingencies are accrued if, in the opinion of management, an adverse outcome is probable and such financial outcome can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings.\nGuarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, valuations, purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations, expected future cash flows including growth rates, discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill, amortization methods and periods, warranty reserves, certain accrued expenses, restructuring and other related charges, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, tax reserves and the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. Any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nThe valuation of inventory includes material, labor and overhead, and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. As a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment, diagnostic test kits, and disposable surgical devices, we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. Our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. Although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or expected usage could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. Amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based ",
