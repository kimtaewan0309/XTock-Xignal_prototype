  "item1_clean": "General Development of Business\nAMETEK, Inc. (“AMETEK” or the “Company”) is incorporated in Delaware. Its predecessor was originally incorporated in Delaware in 1930 under the name American Machine and Metals, Inc. AMETEK is a leading global manufacturer of electronic instruments and electromechanical devices with operations in North America, Europe, Asia and South America. AMETEK maintains its principal executive offices at 1100 Cassatt Road, Berwyn, Pennsylvania, 19312. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: AME), the common stock of AMETEK is a component of the Standard and Poor’s 500 and the Russell 1000 Indices.\nProducts and Services\nAMETEK’s products are marketed and sold worldwide through two operating groups: Electronic Instruments (“EIG”) and Electromechanical (“EMG”). Electronic Instruments is a leader in the design and manufacture of advanced instruments for the process, power and industrial, and aerospace markets. Electromechanical is a differentiated supplier of precision motion control solutions, highly engineered medical components and devices, thermal management systems, specialty metals and electrical interconnects. Its end markets include aerospace and defense, medical, automation and other industrial markets.\nCompetitive Strengths\nManagement believes AMETEK has significant competitive advantages that help strengthen and sustain its market positions. Those advantages include:\nSignificant Market Share\n. AMETEK maintains significant market share in a number of targeted niche markets through its ability to produce and deliver high-quality, differentiated products at competitive prices. EIG has significant market positions in niche segments of the process, power and industrial, and aerospace markets. EMG holds significant positions in niche segments of the aerospace and defense, automation and medical markets.\nTechnological and Development Capabilities\n. AMETEK believes it has certain technological advantages over its competitors that allow it to maintain its leading market positions. Historically, the Company has demonstrated an ability to develop innovative new products and solutions that support customer needs. AMETEK has consistently added to its investment in research, development and engineering, and improved its new product development efforts with the adoption of Design for Six Sigma and Value Analysis/Value Engineering methodologies. These have improved the pace and quality of product innovation and resulted in the introduction of a steady stream of new products across all of AMETEK’s businesses and aligned with attractive secular growth markets.\nEfficient and Flexible Manufacturing Operations.\nThrough its Operational Excellence initiatives, AMETEK has established a lean and flexible manufacturing platform for its businesses. In its effort to achieve best-cost manufacturing, AMETEK has operating facilities, as of December 31, 2024, in China, Czechia, Malaysia, Mexico, and Serbia. These facilities offer proximity to customers and provide opportunities for increasing international sales. Acquisitions also have allowed AMETEK to achieve operating synergies by consolidating operations, product lines and distribution channels, benefiting both of AMETEK’s operating groups.\nExperienced Management Team\n. Another component of AMETEK’s success is the strength of its management team and that team’s commitment to improving Company performance. AMETEK senior management has extensive industry experience and an average of approximately 23 years of AMETEK service. The management team is focused on delivering strong, consistent and profitable growth, growing\nshareholder value, and creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders. Individual performance is tied to financial results through Company-established stock ownership guidelines and equity incentive programs.\nAMETEK is committed to achieving earnings growth through the successful implementation of the AMETEK Growth Model. The goal of the Growth Model is high single digit annual percentage growth in sales and double digit annual percentage growth in earnings per share over the business cycle, strong cash flow generation, and a superior return on total capital. Other financial initiatives have been or may be undertaken, including public and private debt or equity issuance, bank debt refinancing, local financing in certain foreign countries and share repurchases.\nAMETEK’s Growth Model integrates the four growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions, Global and Market Expansion, and New Product Development with a focus on cash generation and capital deployment.\nOperational Excellence.\nOperational Excellence is AMETEK’s cornerstone strategy for accelerating growth, improving profit margins and strengthening its competitive position across its businesses. Operational Excellence focuses on initiatives to drive increased organic sales growth, improvements in operating efficiencies and sustainable practices. It emphasizes team building and a participative management culture. AMETEK’s Operational Excellence strategies include lean manufacturing, global sourcing, Design for Six Sigma, Value Engineering/Value Analysis, growth kaizens, and digitalization. Each plays an important role in improving efficiency, enhancing the pace and quality of innovation and driving profitable sales growth. Operational Excellence initiatives have yielded lower operating and administrative costs, shortened manufacturing cycle times, resulted in higher cash flow from operations and increased customer satisfaction. They also have played a key role in achieving synergies with newly acquired companies.\nStrategic Acquisitions\n. Acquisitions are a key to achieving the goals of the AMETEK Growth Model. Since the beginning of 2020 through December 31, 2024, AMETEK has completed 14 acquisitions with annualized sales totaling approximately $1.4 billion. AMETEK targets companies that offer a compelling strategic, technical and cultural fit. It seeks to acquire businesses in adjacent markets with complementary products and technologies. It also looks for businesses that provide attractive growth opportunities aligned with strong secular growth themes, often in new and emerging markets. AMETEK’s management team has developed considerable skill in identifying, acquiring and integrating new businesses. As it has executed its acquisition strategy, AMETEK’s mix of businesses has shifted toward those that are more highly differentiated and, therefore, offer better opportunities for growth and profitability.\nGlobal & Market Expansion\n. AMETEK has experienced significant growth outside the United States, reflecting an expanding international customer base, investments in its global infrastructure and the attractive growth potential of its businesses in overseas markets. While Europe remains its largest overseas market, AMETEK has pursued growth opportunities worldwide, especially in key emerging markets. It has grown sales in Latin America and Asia by driving its global and market expansion strategy and initiatives. AMETEK also has expanded its sales, service, and engineering capabilities globally. Recently acquired businesses have further added to AMETEK’s international presence.\nNew Product Development\n. New products are essential to AMETEK’s long-term growth. As a result, AMETEK has maintained a consistent investment in new product development and engineering. AMETEK's businesses help solve our customers' most complex challenges with differentiated technology solutions. In 2024, AMETEK added to its highly differentiated product portfolio with a range of new products across many of its businesses.\nAMETEK focuses on cash generation and capital deployment. AMETEK generates strong cash flow given its asset-light business model and strong operational execution. This cash flow supports AMETEK’s capital\ndeployment strategy with its primary focus on strategic, value-enhancing acquisitions. AMETEK is also committed to paying a consistently increasing cash dividend.\nAttracting, retaining, and developing talent is critical to the success and sustainability of the AMETEK Growth Model as our employees are responsible for successfully driving these strategies.\nOperating Performance\nIn 2024, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results from contributions from recent acquisitions, as well as the Company's Operational Excellence initiatives. See \"Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details.\nIn 2024, the Company achieved record sales of $6,941.2 million, an increase of 5.2% from 2023. Diluted earnings per share for 2024 were a record $5.93, an increase of $0.26 or 4.5%, compared with $5.67 per diluted share in 2023.\nAMETEK spent $117.5 million in cash in October 2024, net of cash acquired, to purchase Virtek Vision International (\"Virtek\"), a leading provider of advanced laser-based projection and inspection systems.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company paid in full, at maturity, a $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.73% senior notes.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis under ASC 280.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis report includes forward-looking statements based on the Company’s current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. When used in this report, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “may,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such words. In this report, the Company discloses important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management’s expectations. For more information on these and other factors, see “Forward-Looking Information” herein.\nAMETEK’s operations are affected by global, regional and industry-specific economic factors. However, the Company’s strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to mitigate the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. In 2024, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, and operating cash flow. Positive market trends, the Company's backlog, contributions from recent acquisitions, and continued focus on and implementation of Operational Excellence initiatives had a positive impact on 2024 results. The Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEK's four key strategies: Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions, Global & Market Expansion and New Products.\nHighlights in 2024 were:\nNet sales for 2024 were a record $6,941.2 million, an increase of $344.2 million or 5.2%, compared with net sales of $6,597.0 million in 2023.\nNet income for 2024 was a record $1,376.1 million, an increase of $62.9 million or 4.8%, compared with $1,313.2 million in 2023.\nDiluted earnings per share for 2024 were a record $5.93, an increase of $0.26 or 4.5%, compared with $5.67 per diluted share in 2023.\nCash provided by operating activities totaled a record $1,828.8 million in 2024, an increase of $93.5 million or 5.4%, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $1,735.3 million in 2023.\nThe Company's backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2024 was $3,403.2 million.\nIn October 2024, the Company spent $117.5 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to purchase Virtek Vision International (\"Virtek\"), a leading provider of advanced laser-based projection and inspection systems.\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) was a record $2,151.6 million in 2024, compared with $2,014.7 million in 2023.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company paid in full, at maturity, a $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.73% senior notes.\nThe Company continued its emphasis on investment in research, development and engineering, spending $371.9 million in 2024. Approximately 27% of sales in 2024 were from products introduced in the past three years.\nResults of Operations\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared with the year ended December 31, 2023\nNet sales for 2024 were $6,941.2 million, an increase of $344.2 million or 5.2%, compared with net sales of $6,597.0 million in 2023. The increase in net sales for 2024 was due to a 7% increase from acquisitions, partially offset by a 2% organic sales decline. EIG net sales were $4,659.9 million in 2024, an increase of 0.8%, compared with $4,624.3 million in 2023.

The increase in international sales was primarily driven by strong demand in Europe and Asia, as well as contributions from the 2023 acquisitions. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $1,880.8 million in 2024, an increase of $148.4 million or 8.6%, compared with $1,732.4 million in 2023.\nOrders for 2024 were $6,810.3 million, a decrease of $102.1 million or 1.5% compared with $6,912.4 million in 2023. The decrease in orders was due to a 2% organic order decrease, a 1% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 2% increase from acquisitions. The organic orders decrease is due to customer inventory normalization in our automation and engineered solutions core businesses. The Company’s backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2024 was $3,403.2 million, a decrease of $130.9 million or 3.7%, compared with $3,534.1 million at December 31, 2023.\nSegment operating income for 2024 was $1,884.9 million, an increase of $77.4 million or 4.3%, compared with segment operating income of $1,807.5 million in 2023.
