Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Business Environment and Results of Operations–Business Outlook.\nWe operate under two divisions, which form the basis for the two operating segments we report, the Completion and Production segment and the Drilling and Evaluation segment.\nCompletion and Production\ndelivers cementing, stimulation, specialty chemicals, intervention, pressure control, artificial lift, and completion products and services. The segment consists of the following product service lines:\n- Artificial Lift: provides services to maximize reservoir and wellbore recovery by applying lifting technology, intelligent field management solutions, and related services throughout the life of the well, including electrical submersible pumps.\n- Cementing: involves bonding the well and well casing while isolating fluid zones and maximizing wellbore stability. Our cementing product service line also provides casing equipment.\n- Completion Tools: provides downhole solutions and services to our customers to complete their wells, including well completion products and services, intelligent well completions, liner hanger systems, sand control systems, multilateral systems, and service tools.\n- Multi-Chem: provides customized specialty chemicals and services for completion, production, midstream, and downstream to optimize flow assurance and integrity. During the third quarter of 2024, we made a strategic decision to market for sale a portion of our chemical business.\n- Pipeline & Process Services: provides a complete range of pre-commissioning, commissioning, maintenance, and decommissioning services to the onshore and offshore pipeline and process plant construction commissioning and maintenance industries.\n- Production Enhancement: includes stimulation services and sand control services. Stimulation services optimize reservoir production through a variety of pressure pumping services and chemical processes, commonly known as hydraulic fracturing and acidizing. Sand control services include fluids and chemicals for the prevention of sand production of unconsolidated reservoirs.\n- Production Solutions: provides customized well intervention solutions to increase well performance, which includes coiled tubing, hydraulic workover units, downhole tools, pumping services, and nitrogen services.\nDrilling and Evaluation\nprovides field and reservoir modeling, drilling, fluids, evaluation and precise wellbore placement solutions that enable customers to model, measure, drill, and optimize their well construction activities. The segment consists of the following product service lines:\n- Baroid: provides drilling fluid systems, performance additives, completion fluids, solids control, specialized testing equipment, and waste management services for drilling wells, completion, and workover operations.\n- Drill Bits and Services: provides roller cone bits, fixed cutter bits, hole enlargement and related downhole tools and services used in drilling wells. In addition, coring equipment and services are provided to extract formation cores for rock properties evaluation.\n- Halliburton Project Management: provides integrated solutions by leveraging the full line of our well construction, well completion, and well intervention services to solve customer challenges throughout the entire well lifecycle, including project management and integrated asset management.\n- Landmark Software and Services: provides cloud based digital services and artificial intelligence solutions on an open architecture for subsurface insights, integrated well construction, and reservoir and production management.\n- Sperry Drilling: provides drilling systems and services that offer directional control for precise wellbore placement while providing important measurements about the characteristics of the drill string and geological formations while drilling wells. These services include directional and horizontal drilling, measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, surface data logging, and rig site information systems.\n- Testing and Subsea: provides acquisition and analysis of dynamic reservoir information and reservoir optimization solutions through a broad portfolio of well testing tools, data acquisition services, fluid sampling, surface well testing, subsea safety systems, and underbalanced applications.\n- Wireline and Perforating: provides open-hole logging services that supply information on formation evaluation and reservoir fluid analysis, including formation lithology, rock properties, and reservoir fluid properties.

Our services and products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Competitive factors impacting sales of our services and products include: price; service delivery; health, safety, and environmental standards and practices; service quality; global talent retention; understanding the geological characteristics of the reservoir; product quality; and technical proficiency.\nWe conduct business worldwide in more than 70 countries. The business operations of our divisions are organized around four primary geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS, and Middle East/Asia. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, based on the location of services provided and products sold, 40%, 44%, and 45%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the United States. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue during these periods. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about our geographic operations. Because the markets for our services and products are vast and cross numerous geographic lines, it is not practicable to provide a meaningful estimate of the total number of our competitors. The industries we serve are highly competitive, and we have many substantial competitors. Most of our services and products are marketed through our service and sales organizations.\nThe following charts depict our revenue split between our four primary geographic regions for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nOur operations in some countries and regions may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, force majeure, war or other armed conflict, health or similar issues, sanctions, trade barriers and tariffs, expropriation or other governmental actions, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency exchange restrictions and highly inflationary currencies, as well as other geopolitical factors. We believe the geographic diversification of our business activities reduces the risk that an interruption of operations in any single country, other than the United States, would be materially adverse to our business, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated financial condition.\nInformation regarding our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, risk concentration, and financial instruments used to minimize risk is included in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Instrument Market Risk” and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16.\nOur revenue during the past three years was derived from the sale of services and products to the energy industry. No single customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in any period presented.\nRaw materials essential to our business are normally readily available. However, market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw materials, such as proppants (primarily sand), chemicals, metals, gels, and electronic components (circuit boards). We are always striving to ensure the availability of resources and manage raw material costs. Our procurement department uses our relationships and buying power to enhance our access to key materials at competitive prices.\nWe own a large number of patents and have pending a substantial number of patent applications covering various products and processes. We are also licensed ",
