This higher demand during the third quarter results in higher ticket prices and occupancy levels and, accordingly, the largest share of our operating income is typically earned during this period. Our results are also impacted by ships being taken out-of-service for planned maintenance, which we schedule during non-peak seasons. In addition, substantially all of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours’ revenue and operating income is generated from May through September in conjunction with Alaska’s cruise season.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nWe believe the volatility in the cost of fuel is reasonably likely to impact our profitability in both the short and long-term.\nWe believe the increasing focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and new and evolving related regulatory requirements, are reasonably likely to have a material negative impact on our future financial results. We became subject to the EU Emissions Trading System (“ETS”) on January 1, 2024, which includes a three-year phase-in period. The impact of this regulation in 2024 was $46 million, which represented costs associated with 40% of emissions under the ETS operational scope. In 2025, 70% of emissions under the ETS scope will be impacted, and in 2026, all in scope emissions will be impacted.\nStatistical Information\nPassenger Cruise Days (“PCDs”)\nAvailable Lower Berth Days (“ALBDs”)\nOccupancy percentage (d)\nFuel consumption in metric tons\nFuel consumption in metric tons per thousand ALBDs\nFuel cost per metric ton consumed (excluding European Union Allowance (“EU Allowances”))\nCurrencies (USD to 1)\nAUD\nCAD\nEUR\nGBP\nNotes to Statistical Information\nPCD represents the number of cruise passengers on a voyage multiplied by the number of revenue-producing ship operating days for that voyage.\nALBD is a standard measure of passenger capacity for the period that we use to approximate rate and capacity variances, based on consistently applied formulas that we use to perform analyses to determine the main non-capacity driven factors that cause our cruise revenues and expenses to vary. ALBDs assume that each cabin we offer for sale accommodates two passengers and is computed by multiplying passenger capacity by revenue-producing ship operating days in the period.\nFor the three months ended August 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024, we had a 2.5% capacity decrease in ALBDs comprised of a 3.1% capacity decrease in our North America segment and a 1.5% capacity decrease in our Europe segment.\nOur North America segment’s capacity decrease was driven by the following:\nSeabourn 460-passenger capacity ship that left the fleet in September 2024\nP&O Cruises (Australia) 2,000-passenger capacity ship that left the fleet in February 2025\nOur Europe segment’s capacity decrease was driven by fewer ship operating days in 2025 compared to 2024.\nFor the nine months ended August 31, 2025 compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2024, we had a 0.9% capacity increase in ALBDs comprised of a 0.8% capacity increase in our North America segment and a 1.2% capacity increase in our Europe segment.\nOur North America segment’s capacity increase was caused by the following:\nCarnival Cruise Line 5,360-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in December 2023\nPrincess Cruises 4,310-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in February 2024\nCarnival Cruise Line 4,130-passenger capacity ship that was transferred from Costa Cruises and entered into service in April 2024\nOur North America segment’s capacity increase was partially offset by:\nSeabourn 460-passenger capacity ship that left the fleet in September 2024\nP&O Cruises (Australia) 2,000-passenger capacity ship that left the fleet in February 2025\nOur Europe segment’s capacity increase was caused by:\nCunard 2,960-passenger capacity ship that entered into service in May 2024\nNonrecurrence of the Red Sea rerouting without guests\nThe increase in our Europe segment’s capacity was partially offset by a Costa Cruises 4,240-passenger capacity ship that transferred to Carnival Cruise Line in February 2024.\nOccupancy, in accordance with cruise industry practice, is calculated using a numerator of PCDs and a denominator of ALBDs, which assumes two passengers per cabin even though some cabins can accommodate three or more passengers. Percentages in excess of 100% indicate that on average more than two passengers occupied some cabins.\nThree Months Ended August 31, 2025 (“2025”) Compared to Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 (“2024”)\nPassenger ticket revenues made up 67% of our 2025 total revenues. Passenger ticket revenues increased by $191 million, or 3.6%, to $5.4 billion in 2025 from $5.2 billion in 2024.\nThis increase was caused by:\n$215 million - higher ticket prices driven by continued strength in demand\n$115 million - net favorable foreign currency translation impact\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n$132 million - 2.5% capacity decrease in ALBDs\n$31 million - decrease in air transportation revenue\nThe remaining 33% of 2025 total revenues were comprised of onboard and other revenues, which increased by $66 million, or 2.5%, and were $2.7 billion in 2025 and 2024.\nThis increase was caused by:\n$90 million - higher onboard spending by our guests\n$33 million - net favorable foreign currency translation impact\nThese increases were partially offset by a 2.5% capacity decrease in ALBDs, representing $65 million.\nNorth America Segment\nPassenger ticket revenues made up 65% of our North America segment’s 2025 total revenues. Passenger ticket revenues increased by $15 million, or 0.4%, to $3.5 billion in 2025 from $3.4 billion in 2024.\nThis increase was caused by $156 million of higher ticket prices driven by continued strength in demand.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n$105 million - 3.1% capacity decrease in ALBDs\n$31 million - decrease in air transportation revenue\nThe remaining 35% of our North America segment’s 2025 total revenues were comprised of onboard and other revenues, which increased by $12 million, or 0.6%, and were $1.9 billion in 2025 and 2024. This increase was caused by $74 million of higher onboard spending by our guests, partially offset by a 3.1% capacity decrease in ALBDs, representing $57 million.\nPassenger ticket revenues made up 78% of our Europe segment’s 2025 total revenues. Passenger ticket revenues increased by $166 million, or 9.1%, to $2.0 billion in 2025 from $1.8 billion in 2024.\nThis increase was caused by:\n$115 million - net favorable foreign currency translation\n$59 million - higher ticket prices driven by continued strength in demand\n$21 million - 1.3 percentage point increase in occupancy\nThese increases were partially offset by a 1.5% capacity decrease in ALBDs, representing $27 million.\nThe remaining 22% of our Europe segment’s 2025 total revenues were comprised of onboard and other revenues, which increased by $54 million, or 11%, to $569 million in 2025 from $515 million in 2024.\nThis increase was driven by:\n$33 million - net favorable foreign currency translation impact\n$16 million - higher onboard spending by our guests\nOperating expenses increased by $82 million, or 1.9%, to $4.4 billion in 2025 from $4.3 billion in 2024.\nThis increase was caused by:\n$67 million - net unfavorable foreign currency translation\n$31 million - higher onboard and other cost of sales driven by higher onboard spending by our guests\n$29 million - higher cruise payroll and related expenses\n$29 million - higher port expenses\n$24 million - higher commissions, transportation costs, and other expenses driven by increased ticket pricing\n$23 million - nonrecurrence of a change in pension valuation in 2024\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n$109 million - 2.5% capacity decrease in ALBDs\n$26 million - lower fuel prices including the impact of the cost of EU allowances\n$26 million - lower fuel consumption per ALBD\nSelling and administrative expenses increased by $16 million, or 2.1%, to $779 million in 2025 from $763 million in 2024.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased by $66 million, or 10%, to $717 million in 2025 from $651 million in 2024. This increase was driven by fleet enhancements.\nNorth America Segment\nOperating expenses decreased by $65 million, or 2.2%, to $2.9 billion in 2025 from $3.0 billion in 2024.\nThis decrease was caused by:\n$92 million - 3.1% capacity decrease in ALBDs\n$28 million - lower fuel prices including the impact of the cost of EU allowances\nThese decreases were partially offset by $23 million of higher cruise payroll and related expenses.\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased by $19 million, or 4.2%, to $436 million in 2025 from $455 million in 2024.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased by $37 million, or 8.8%, to $461 million in 2025 from $424 million in 2024.\nOperating expenses increased by $135 million, or 12%, to $1.3 billion in 2025 from $1.2 billion in 2024.\nThis increase was driven by:\n$67 million - net unfavorable foreign currency translation\n$23 million - nonrecurrence of a change in pension valuation in 2024\n$21 million - higher commissions, transportation costs, and other expenses driven by increased ticket pricing\nSelling and administrative expenses increased by $22 million, or 9.8%, to $244 million in 2025 from $223 million in 2024.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased by $24 million, or 14%, to $196 million in 2025 from $173 million in 2024.
