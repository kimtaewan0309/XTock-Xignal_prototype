We present certain financial measures on an \"adjusted\", or \"non-GAAP\", basis because we believe such measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance. For each non-GAAP financial measure, including adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\"), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted effective tax rate, and capital expenditures, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. These reconciliations and explanations regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures are presented under the “\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n” section beginning on page\nWe manage our operations, assess performance, and report earnings under five reportable segments: Americas, Asia, Europe, Middle East and India, and Corporate and other. The discussion that follows is based on these operations. Refer to Note 20,\nBusiness Segment Information\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nFor information concerning activity with our related parties, refer to Note 19,\nSupplemental Information\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2025 VS. THIRD QUARTER 2024\nTHIRD QUARTER 2025 IN SUMMARY\nSales of $3.0 billion\n\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 0.8% from 0.9% in the prior year.\nBusiness and Asset Actions\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recorded a charge of $24.1 ($15.4 after tax, or $0.07 per share) related to business and asset actions. This charge reflects updated cost estimates associated with our previously announced decision to exit certain clean energy generation and distribution projects. For additional information, refer to the discussion for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 beginning on page\nof this Management's Discussion and Analysis as well as Note 4,\nBusiness and Asset Actions\n, to the consolidated financial statements. The charge is not reflected in segment results.\nOur estimates related to exiting these projects reflect our best judgment based on information available as of 30 June 2025. Final settlement of these items may differ materially from our current estimates, which could impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods. Additionally, our Board of Directors continues to review the business, which may lead to decisions that could result in additional charges in future periods.\nShareholder Activism-Related Costs\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recorded shareholder activism-related costs of $25.0 ($18.8 after tax, or $0.08 per share). These costs primarily reflect a cash reimbursement to Mantle Ridge for expenses incurred during its proxy engagement with Air Products. Refer to Note 19,\nSupplemental Information\n, for additional information. Shareholder activism-related costs are not reflected in segment results.\nGain on Sale of Business\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recognized a gain of $67.3 ($51.9 after tax, or $0.23 per share) on the sale of our 100% ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary in Singapore. This gain is not reflected in the results of the Asia segment. Refer to Note 5,\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Prior to the divestiture, the subsidiary contributed annual sales of approximately $50 to our Asia segment, primarily through the merchant gas supply mode.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income of $36.5 increased 82%, or $16.4. The increase was driven by a $31.3 gain ($23.8 after tax, or $0.11 per share) on the sale of a regional office in Hersham, England, which was not reflected in the results of the Europe segment. In the prior-year quarter, other income benefited from a favorable legal settlement in our Americas segment related to energy management charges in connection with an extreme weather event in 2021.\nOperating Income and Operating Margin\nOperating income of $790.6 increased 7%, or $53.0. In fiscal year 2025, we recognized pre-tax gains totaling approximately $99 in connection with the sale of a consolidated subsidiary and a regional office, as described above. Compared to the prior year, higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, favorably impacted operating results by $15, driven by non-helium merchant products. Costs were $9 favorable as productivity improvements and lower planned maintenance were partially offset by higher depreciation expense, fixed-cost inflation, and a favorable legal settlement recorded in the prior year. These items were partially offset by shareholder activism-related costs of $25 and charges for business and asset actions of $24. Additionally, volumes were unfavorable by $23, reflecting the September 2024 divestiture of the LNG business, lower global helium demand, and previously announced project exits. In the prior year, the LNG business contributed approximately $35 in operating income. These headwinds were partially offset by higher on-site volumes.\nOperating margin of 26.2% increased 150 bp compared to 24.7% in the prior year, primarily reflecting the margin impact of gains from the sale of a subsidiary and a regional office, partially offset by charges for business and asset actions and shareholder activism-related costs.\nEquity Affiliates' Income\nEquity affiliates' income of $167.6 decreased 1%, or $1.3.\nLess: Capitalized interest\nInterest expense of $61.4 increased 10%, or $5.7, driven by the impact of project exits and a higher debt balance, partially offset by a higher carrying value of ongoing projects under construction.\nOther Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net\nOther non-operating expense of $6.0 increased $4.7 from the prior year. De-designated interest rate swaps related to financing for the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project resulted in an immaterial unrealized loss in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, compared to a gain of $11.2 ($3.0 after tax, or $0.01 per share) in the prior year. Refer to Note 3,\nVariable Interest Entities\nFinancial Instruments\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Additionally, we recognized lower interest income on short-term investments in fiscal year 2025. These items were partially offset by a decrease in non-service pension costs, which were $10.9 ($8.1 after tax, or $0.04 per share) for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 versus $25.3 ($19.1 after tax, or $0.09 per share) in the prior year.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recorded a pre-tax loss from discontinued operations of $10.6 ($8.0 after tax) primarily to increase our existing liability for retained environmental remediation obligations associated with production facilities in the atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses sold in 2008. Refer to the \"Piedmont\" discussion under Note 14,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information. The loss did not have an impact on our statement of cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025.\nNet income of $723.2 increased 2%, or $14.3. Fiscal year 2025 benefited from gains recognized in connection with the sale of a consolidated subsidiary and a regional office, higher non-helium merchant pricing, and lower non-service pension costs. Costs were also favorable, as productivity improvements and lower planned maintenance were partially offset by higher depreciation expense, fixed-cost inflation, and a prior year legal settlement. These items were partially offset by lower volumes, shareholder activism-related costs, and charges for business and asset actions. The lower volumes were primarily associated with the divestiture of the LNG business in September 2024. Additionally, fiscal year 2025 includes an after-tax loss from discontinued operations, primarily reflecting an increase to an existing liability for retained environmental remediation obligations associated with a previously divested business.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion increased 3%, or $42.9, driven by favorable costs and higher pricing, partially offset by lower volumes.\nThe effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income before taxes. Equity affiliates' income is primarily included net of income taxes within income before taxes on our consolidated income statements.\nOur effective tax rate was 17.9% and 16.6% for the three months ended 30 June 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our effective rate was higher in fiscal year 2025 due to lower tax benefits on both U.S. export income and excess tax benefits on share-based compensation, and higher net costs on foreign-related income taxed in the U.S. These increases were partially offset by larger benefits in fiscal year 2025 for the release of certain unrecognized tax benefits upon expiration of the statute of limitations.\nOur adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes the impact of adjustments presented in the \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section beginning on page\n, was 18.1% and 16.9% for the three months ended 30 June 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOn 4 July 2025, H.R.1, commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), was enacted in the United States. OBBBA includes a broad range of tax reform provisions, including extending and modifying certain key Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions (both domestic and international), expanding certain Inflation Reduction Act incentives, and accelerating the phase-out of other provisions. We are evaluating the impacts of this legislation on our consolidated financial statements.\nDespite the OBBBA’s revisions to the Inflation Reduction Act incentives, we still anticipate future benefits "
