  "item1_clean": "We own certain drug delivery technology intellectual property, that we continue to seek to commercialize through agreements with third parties, such as pharmaceutical companies, which are included in the Other segment.\nMARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION\nWe market, sell, and service our products worldwide through our marketing, customer service, sales, and technical service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain a sales presence in the U.S. and in major regions worldwide including Africa, Asia Pacific, Canada, Europe, and Latin America.\nGenerally, we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory requirements, and other factors. We market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians directly in the U.S. Outside the U.S., we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors and other resellers. We sell our veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide, generally through our direct sales force. We market our diagnostic imaging products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. We market our software products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. We market our Water and LPD products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through selected independent distributors. We sell our OPTI products and services both directly and through independent human medical product distributors.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nOur business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas. We maintain active research and development programs in each of our three primary business segments. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, certain licensing agreements, materials and external consulting and development costs, were $219.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, or 5.6% of our consolidated revenue, $191.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, or 5.2% of our consolidated revenue and $254.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, or 7.6% of our consolidated revenue.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING PATENTS AND LICENSES\nWe actively seek to protect our intellectual property rights and the competitive position of our innovative offerings through various approaches, including the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. We file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the U.S. and other countries as we believe appropriate, and we seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We also license patents and technologies from third parties.\nWhile we consider ownership of these intellectual property rights in the aggregate to be important to us, we do not believe that any single patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or license is material to our business as a whole, except for licenses related to our Catalyst instruments and consumables, and we primarily rely on the innovative skills, technical expertise, customer focus and knowledge, and marketing abilities of our employees for our business success. In addition, a range of factors help to mitigate the future potential effects of the expiration of any of our patents, licenses, and other intellectual property rights on our results of operations and financial position. These factors include, but are not limited to:\npublications, including peer-reviewed third-party studies, that demonstrate the performance and benefits of our products and services;\nour brand strength and reputation in the marketplace;\nthe breadth, quality and integration of our product and service offerings;\nour existing customer relationships and our customer service and support;\nour online ordering platform that enables direct ordering of (including establishing automatic reorder schedules for) our consumables, tests and other products by our customers;\nthe applicable regulatory approval status for certain products;\nour continued investments in innovative product and service improvements that result in new technologies, features, functionalities, enhancements, integrations, and/or additional patents and other intellectual property rights;\nour investment in diagnostic innovations that results in new product and service offerings that are patentable and that expand the test menu for our in-clinic instruments and/or reference laboratory business; and\nour significant know-how, scale and investments related to the product design and manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments.\nWe own or have license rights to various patents, patent applications, and technologies in the U.S. and other countries. These patents, patent applications, and technologies relate to intellectual property embodied in certain of our CAG products and services (including our Catalyst instruments and consumables and certain reference laboratory tests), LPD diagnostic products, and Water testing products, as well as other subject matters relevant to the manufacture and commercialization of these products and services. Although certain of these patents and licenses are expected to expire in future years, the expiration of these patents and licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations. In addition, we face robust competition as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products and services to market, despite the protections afforded by these patent and license rights.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection as appropriate, we also protect certain intellectual property (such as software and our manufacturing know-how) through U.S. and international trade secret and copyright laws. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how in many ways, including through confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and third parties with which we do business (such as vendors, strategic partners, and consultants) and internal confidentiality processes and procedures.\n\nand dairy testing products\n. We compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, speed, accuracy, product quality, and other performance characteristics of our products and services (including differentiated tests), the breadth of our product line and services, the effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, the quality of our technical and customer service, our ability to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies and our pricing relative to the value of our products in comparison with competitive products and services. Our competitors include smaller regional companies and larger companies with livestock and poultry diagnostics and water testing solution products, such as Neogen Corporation, Charm Sciences, Inc., BioChek, Innovative Diagnostics and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\nVeterinary Software, Services and Diagnostic Imaging Systems\n. We compete primarily on the basis of functionality, system workflows, performance characteristics, effectiveness of our implementation, training process and customer service, information handling capabilities, advances in technologies, enhancement of veterinary practice efficiency, and our pricing relative to the value of our products and services in comparison with competitive products and services. We sell these products primarily in North America and Europe. Our largest competitor in North America and the U.K. is Covetrus, Inc., which offers several systems and leverages its animal health distribution business in sales and service. We also compete with numerous highly focused smaller companies throughout the geographies in which we offer veterinary software, including those offering cloud-based solutions. Our competitors in the diagnostic imaging systems sector include Sound-Eklin, Antech Diagnostics, FUJIFILM, and Heska.\nHuman point-of-care medical diagnostic products\n. We compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, menu, convenience, international distribution and service, instrument reliability, and our pricing relative to the value of our products. We compete primarily with large human medical diagnostics companies such as Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Instrumentation Laboratory Company, Abbott Diagnostics, a division of Abbott Laboratories, and Roche Diagnostics Corporation.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nMany of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies that relates to, among other things, product approvals, product registrations, manufacturing, import, export, distribution, marketing and promotion, labeling, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage, product disposal, environmental compliance, and workplace safety. The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.\nVeterinary diagnostic products\n. Our veterinary diagnostic products, including instruments, such as Catalyst One and ProCyte One, as well as their corresponding consumables, are veterinary medical devices under the jurisdiction of the FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). Other products under FDA jurisdiction include our rapid assay products such as SNAP devices and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates. While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to FDA inspections or the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (“cGMP”), the FDA Act specifies that these products must not be adulterated, mislabeled, or misbranded.\nA subset of our veterinary diagnostic products, including our diagnostic test kits for companion and food animal infectious diseases, as well as most of our livestock and poultry products and many of our rapid assay products, are licensed and regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). These products must be approved by APHIS before they may be sold in and from the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product validation data, including manufacturing process and facility documentation. Following regulatory licensure to market a product, APHIS requires that each product serial be submitted for test review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval to support product registration for sale, distribution, and use within their countries. However, compliance with extensive country-specific regulatory processes is required in connection with importing and marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, Canada, Brazil, the Netherlands, China, and many other countries. We are\nalso required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine which also covers our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee. Our LPD manufacturing facility in Montpellier, France is a USDA-permitted site, and has been approved by APHIS to manufacture specified USDA-permitted products.\nWater testing products\n. Our water tests are generally not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the U.S. that is regulated by the EPA, t",
  "item7_clean": "Disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable, and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time. In response to outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. Conversely, successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products. In addition, increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products. As a result, the performance in certain sectors of this business can fluctuate.\nOur strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture, and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance. The manufacture of these testing products leverages the SNAP platform and production assets that also support our rapid assay business, which also leverages the SNAP platform. The dairy SNAP products incorporate customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection.\n. Our strategy in the OPTI Medical business for the human market is to develop, manufacture, and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers, and related consumable products, for the medical point-of-care diagnostics sector worldwide, with a focus on small to mid-sized hospitals. We seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use, convenience, international distribution and service, and instrument reliability. Similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy, a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers.\nPreviously, we also provided human testing solutions for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. During the first quarter of 2023, we discontinued actively marketing our COVID-19 testing products and services.\nOur facility in Roswell, Georgia, develops and manufactures the OPTI product lines using the same or similar technology to support the electrolyte requirements of certain CAG products. We leverage this facility’s know-how, intellectual\nproperty, and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the VetStat and Catalyst platforms for veterinary applications, while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nWe believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change.\nWe enter into contracts where customers purchase combinations of IDEXX products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires judgment. We determine the transaction price for a contract based on the total consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the transferred goods or services. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as volume rebates or expected price adjustments, we apply judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of revenue recognized. We evaluate constraints based on our historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts.\nWe allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to the relative standalone selling prices and recognize revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred for each obligation. We utilize the observable standalone selling price when available, which represents the price charged for the promised product or service when sold separately. When standalone selling prices for our products or services are not directly observable, we determine the standalone selling prices using relevant information available and apply suitable estimation methods including, but not limited to, the cost plus a margin approach.\nOur customer commitment arrangements that include free or discounted instruments and systems, such as our IDEXX 360 program, provide customers with free or discounted instruments or systems upon entering into multi-year arrangements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services. We allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases and expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices, to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance in advance of billing the customer, which is also when the customer obtains control of the instrument based on legal title transfer. Our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a contract asset within other current and long-term assets. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for products and services over the term of the arrangement. We estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multi-year arrangements. Differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer arrangement, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced contract assets and cumulative recognized revenue related to these programs by approximately $7.5 million as of December 31, 2024.\nOur customer commitment arrangements that include up-front consideration paid to customers provide customers with incentives in the form of IDEXX Points or, from time to time, cash, upon entering into multi-year arrangements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products and services. If a customer breaches their agreement, they are required to refund\nall or a portion of the up-front consideration, or make other repayments, remedial actions, or both. Up-front incentives to customers are not made in exchange for distinct goods or services and are capitalized as consideration paid to customers within other current and long-term assets, which are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer arrangement. If these up-front incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase instruments, we allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases less up-front incentives and estimates of expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices, to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance. We estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multi-year arrangements. Differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer arrangement, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced cumulative recognized revenue related to these programs by approximately $1.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\nOur rebate arrangements provide customers the opportunity to earn future rebates based on the volume of products and services they purchase over the term of the arrangement. We account for the customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on an estimate of rebates the customer will earn over the term of the arrangement. Total consideration allocated to identified performance obligations is limited to goods and services that the customer is presently obligated to purchase and does not include estimates of future purchases that are optional. We allocate total consideration to identified performance obligations, including the customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases, which is deferred and subsequently recognized upon the purchase of products and services. We estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer rebates related to these multi-year arrangements. Differences between estimated and actual customer rebates may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer arrangement, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced deferred revenue and cumulative recognized revenue related to these programs by approximately $0.3 million as of December 31, 2024.\nFuture market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods compared to reductions in the current or prior periods. Additionally, certain customer arrangements require us to estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases, customer rebates and other incentive payments, and price adjustments related to multi-year arrangements. Differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition as described above.\nThe provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.\nWe assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.\nFor those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more-likely-than-not, a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.\nOur net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. Should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future, an adjustment to our deferred taxes would be credited or charged, as appropriate, to income in the period such determination was made.\nWe periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made.\nWe record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. We record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more-likely-than-not be sustained. For positions that we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that we will prevail, we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. If our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes, if the uncertainty is ultimately settled, or if the statute of limitations related to the uncertainty expires, the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change, resolution, or expiration occurs. Our net liability for uncertain tax positions was $18.1 million as of December 31, 2024, and $22.3 million as of December 31, 2023. We also accrue for estimated interest expense and penalties on our uncertain tax positions. Refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14. Income Taxes” in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND TRENDS\nEffects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations\n. Global trends in companion animal healthcare, including growth in demand for clinical services, continue to support solid growth for companion animal diagnostic products and services across regions. In the U.S., average diagnostics revenue per practice grew approximately 4% on a same-store basis during 2024, faster than approximately 3% growth in overall practice revenues. U.S. same-store clinical visits at veterinary practices declined approximately 2% in 2024, impacted by ongoing veterinary practice capacity challenges from the influx of higher volumes during the pandemic, as well as macroeconomic headwinds. Our initial 2025 financial outlook anticipates a decline in U.S. same-store clinical growth levels reflecting these near-term sector and macroeconomic dynamics. Our products and services include solutions that help improve staff productivity and create additional capacity at veterinary clinics. For example, during 2024, we upgraded our IDEXX VetLab Station software and also launched our new slide-free cellular analyzer, IDEXX inVue Dx.\nSupply Chain and Logistics Challenges\n. We believe that building and maintaining a well-managed and disciplined infrastructure has helped minimize impacts of supply chain constraints, including product and component availability issues, logistics challenges, including extended shipping periods and delays, and inflationary pressures. Our proactive approach to managing our operational processes, including forward planning with a focus on working closely with our suppliers and logistics partners, enables us to maintain continued high levels of product and service availability and customer service. We believe we are well-positioned to enable sustained high growth in our businesses and to effectively manage the impacts of potentially relatively higher costs in certain areas to support these growth plans. However, there can be no assurance as to the duration or severity of the supply chain and logistics challenges or the effectiveness of our mitigating activities.\nEffects of Economic Conditions\n. Demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment, including slow economic growth, inflationary pressure, high unemployment, and credit availability. Negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending, resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics or lower use of diagnostics. Unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments, diagnostic imaging, and practice management systems, which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians. In the U.S., we monitor patient visits and clinic rev",
