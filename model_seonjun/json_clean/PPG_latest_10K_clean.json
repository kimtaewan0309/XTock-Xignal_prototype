The Company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth. We align our product development with the macro trends in the markets we serve, including a focus on sustainability and productivity, and leverage core technology platforms to develop products to address unmet market needs. Additionally, we operate laboratories in close geographic proximity to our customers, and we customize our products for our customers' end-use applications. Our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management. We have obtained government funding for a small portion of the Company’s research efforts, and we will continue to pursue government funding, where appropriate.\nRaw Materials, Energy and Logistics\nPPG uses a wide variety of complex raw materials that serve as the building blocks of our manufactured products. The Company’s most significant raw materials include resins, solvents, reactants, titanium dioxide, additives and epoxy. Raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide. Raw materials represent PPG’s single largest production cost component.\nMost of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and continues to make, supply arrangements to meet our planned operating requirements for the future. Supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts with multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. In support of our decarbonization efforts, we continue to increase the amount of renewable energy secured for our operating facilities, and we are increasingly evaluating alternative raw materials that offer sustainable benefits and support the circular economy, including recycled and renewable feedstocks. Prices for certain of our raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices and global supply and demand changes; however, pricing may be impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil, natural gas, and other key feedstocks.\nThrough effective management of raw materials, energy and logistics, the Company aims to maintain a competitive cost position and ensure ongoing security of supply. Security of a sufficient supply of high-quality raw materials is important to PPG’s continued success as it allows the Company to increase production as necessary to keep pace with customer demand. While PPG faced certain raw material shortages and logistical challenges during 2021 and 2022, raw material and logistics availability improved in 2023 and 2024 and is now comparable to pre-pandemic conditions. We continue to focus on improving our competitive cost position and expanding our supply of high-quality raw materials, including strategic initiatives to qualify multiple sources of supply.\nWe typically experience fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, government regulation, tariffs, and global supply and demand fac",
  "item7_clean": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion includes a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Company’s financial results have been recast to present the results of the architectural coatings business in the U.S. and Canada as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nNet sales were approximately $15.8 billion in 2024, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year, due to sales volumes declining and the combination of unfavorable foreign currency translation and divestitures reducing net sales. Despite decreased sales due to lower industry demand in automotive OEM coatings, industrial coatings and architectural coatings in Europe, results were supported by record sales in aerospace coatings and growth in several other key technology-driven businesses.\nIncome before income taxes was $1,852 million in 2024, an increase of $162 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due lower raw material costs, lower performance-based compensation costs and restructuring savings, partially offset by overhead inflation and the impact of lower sales volumes.\nPerformance Overview\n($ in millions, except percentages)\nUnited States and Canada\nEurope, Middle East and Africa (EMEA)\nNet sales decreased $397 million due to the following:\n● Lower sales volumes (-1%)\n● Unfavorable foreign currency translation and divestitures (-1%)\nNet sales increased $628 million due to the following:\n● Higher selling prices (+5%)\n● Favorable foreign currency translation (+1%)\nPartially offset by:\n● Lower sales volumes (-2%)\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n($ in millions, except percentages)\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nCost of sales as a % of net sales\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased $426 million due to the following:\n● Moderating raw material costs\n● Lower sales volume\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased $297 million due to the following:\n● Moderating raw material costs\n● Lower sales volume\nPartially offset by:\n● Wage and other cost inflation\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n($ in millions, except percentages)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a % of net sales\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $10 million primarily due to:\n● Restructuring cost savings\n● Lower performance-based compensation\nPartially offset by:\n● Wage and other cost inflation\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $364 million primarily due to:\n● Wage and other cost inflation\n● Unfavorable foreign currency translation\n● Higher performance-based compensation expense\n● Selling, general and administrative expenses from acquired businesses\nPartially offset by:\n● Restructuring cost savings\nOther charges and other income\n($ in millions, except percentages)\nBusiness restructuring, net\nN/A\nN/A\nImpairment and other related charges, net\nPension settlement charge\nN/A\nN/A\nOther charges/(income), net\nN/A\nN/A\nInterest expense decreased $6 million in 2024 versus 2023 primarily due to lower debt balances.\nInterest expense increased $80 million in 2023 versus 2022 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on PPG’s variable debt obligations.\nInterest income increased $37 million in 2024 versus 2023 primarily due to the favorable impact of higher interest rates.\nInterest income increased $86 million in 2023 versus 2022 primarily due to strong cash generation, resulting in higher levels of cash and cash equivalents, as well as the favorable impact of higher interest rates.\nBusiness restructuring, net\nIn 2022, the Company approved a business restructuring plan which included actions to reduce its global cost structure in response to economic conditions, including softening demand in Europe and lower than expected demand recovery in China. In connection with approval of this restructuring program, the Company recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $33 million.\nImpairment and other related charges, net\nDuring 2024, the Company received written approval from Russian regulatory authorities of a definitive agreement to sell the Company’s remaining Russian business. As a result, the Company classified the business as held for sale as of December 31, 2024 and recognized an impairment charge of $146 million, primarily related to accumulated foreign currency translation losses.\nDuring 2023, as a result of its annual impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter, the Company recorded Impairment and other related charges, net of $158 million due to the goodwill impairment recognized for the traffic solutions reporting unit and $2 million to reduce the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived trademarks.\nDuring 2022, the Company recorded Impairment and other related charges, net of $231 million primarily related to the wind down of the Company’s operations in Russia.\nPension settlement charge\nOther (income)/charges, net\nOther (income)/charges, net was lower in 2023 compared to 2022 due to an increase in the non-service cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense, an increase in environmental remediation costs and foreign currency losses recognized in Argentina related to a central bank adjustment to official foreign currency rates.\nEffective tax rate and earnings per diluted share, continuing operations\n($ in millions, except percentages)\nAdjusted effective tax rate, continuing operations*\nEarnings per diluted share, continuing operations\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share, continuing operations*\n*See the Regulation G reconciliations - results of operations\nThe effective tax rate on continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 25.6%, an increase of 0.3% compared to the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.9%, which was higher than the prior year adjusted effective tax rate in part due to the adverse impact of the Pillar 2 global minimum tax.\nThe effective tax rate on continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 25.3%, an increase of 1.7% compared to the prior year due in part to the goodwill impairment charge, for which there was no tax benefit. The adjusted effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 22.2%, an increase of 0.1% compared to the prior year.\nEarnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased year over year primarily due to lower overhead costs, restructuring cost savings and moderating raw material costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased year over year primarily due to increased selling prices, moderating raw material cost inflation and favorable foreign currency translation impact, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Refer to the Regulation G Reconciliations - Results from Operations for additional information.\nDuring 2024, PPG demonstrated resilience in a challenging industrial macroeconomic environment by growing adjusted EPS, improving aggregate segment margins and generating $1.4 billion in operating cash flow. Net sales were $15.8 billion, a decrease of 2% over the prior year. Results were supported by the breadth and diversity of the business portfolio, as the Company benefited from higher prices in several businesses which was more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation, divestitures and lower sales volumes. Net sales, excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures (\"organic sales\") decreased 1% during the year with continued strong growth in our aerospace coatings business, which was more than offset by declines in the industrial coatings and automotive OEM coatings businesses. On a regional basis, sales volumes were modestly higher in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $5.72, compared to $5.16 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $7.87, up 6% compared to $7.42 in 2023. Combined, segment income increased by 2%. Aggregate segment margins were 70 basis points higher than the prior year, driven by sales of our technology-advantaged products and strong brands.\nDemand for PPG products was mixed by end-use market and geographic region during 2024. Demand for aerospace coatings, which was impacted by mobility restrictions in 2020 and 2021, continues to recover. Global automotive OEM manufacturers’ production decreased by about 1% versus 2023 due to lower demand and extended maintenance periods in the U.S. and Europe. Despite the lower demand, PPG outperformed the market in both Latin America and Asia Pacific. In the U.S. and Canada, demand was strong for aerospace coatings, packaging coatings and traffic solutions but declined for most other businesses. In Latin America, demand was solid throughout the year with steady demand for architectural products and growth in automotive OEM products and packaging coatings. The PPG Comex business made strong contributions, supported by a focus on its omnichannel sales approach. Demand was soft in Europe with the largest impact on the automotive OEM coatings business and the architectural coatings business. In Asia, demand was strong\nwith sales volume growth in aerospace coatings, protective and marine coatings, automotive OEM coatings, industrial coatings and packaging coatings.\nWe anticipate a slow start to 2025 as demand in Europe and in global industrial end-use markets remains challenged. Despite the macroeconomic environment, we expect to deliver organic sales growth of a low single-digit percentage for the year. We anticipate demand growth in China, India and Mexico, continued strength in aerospace coatings as well as protective and marine coatings and expect growth in automotive refinish coatings above industry rates. Gaining momentum in infrastructure spending should aid the traffic solutions business in 2025. Global industrial production is expected to be a headwind and remain at a low level in the first quarter with improvement in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions offset by sluggishness in Europe and in the U.S. In general, most end-use markets do not have significant excess inventories, and any demand improvement should lead to a faster ramp-up of sales volumes.\nSignificant other factors\nDuring the year, PPG successfully executed various strategic initiatives to strengthen the company. In December, the Company completed the divestitures of both the silicas products business and the architectural coatings U.S. and Canada business. These divestitures improve our financial profile, including higher operating margins, and result in a more focused organization which positions the Company to deliver sustainable organic growth. In conjunction with the divestiture of U.S. and Canada architectural coatings business, PPG entered into a supply agreement with the divested business to sell certain products, which will be recognized as Net sales in the refinish coatings, industrial coatings and protective and marine coatings businesses going forward. However, PPG has entered into transition services agreements to provide administrative services subsequent to the sale. The fees for services rendered under the transition services agreements are expected to offset the cost of providing the services.\nPPG made significant progress to reduce costs and improve the profitability of the overall business portfolio through the global restructuring programs that were announced in 2022 and 2023. Total restructuring savings were approximately $40 million in 2024. In October 2024, the Company approved a comprehensive cost reduction program with anticipated annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $175 million once fully implemented, including savings of $60 million in 2025. The multi-year program is focused on reducing structural costs primarily in Europe and in certain other global businesses, along with other corporate costs following the divestitures of PPG’s silicas products business and the architectural coatings business in the U.S. and Canada. The Company will continue to monitor and manage its cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment.\nRaw materials are the Company’s most significant input cost. PPG experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors.\nIn 2024, the company incurred wage inflation, which adversely impacted operating costs compared to 2023. There was an ample supply of commodity-related raw materials in all regions, and raw material costs were a favorable impact to our operating costs for 2024 versus 2023. In 2025, we anticipate that increased raw material costs and enacted tariffs will result in low single-digit percentage inflation. Additionally, we expect manufacturing efficiencies to improve as the year progresses.\nWe achieved selling price improvement across several businesses in 2024 stemming from our advantaged products and solutions. The Company will carefully monitor all costs during 2025 and assess the need for additional selling price increases.\nIn 2024, foreign currency exchange rates were volatile, with the U.S. dollar strengthening in the second half of the year against certain currencies in the countries within the regions where PPG operates, resulting in a net unfavorable impact to net income from continuing operations of approximately $20 million. We expect that foreign currency exchange rates will have a net unfavorable impact on net income from continuing operations in 2025; however, the Company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, which reduces foreign currency transaction-related impacts to net income.\nThe 2025 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%, varying by quarter. This range is the Company’s best estimate and represents an increase compared to the 2024 adjusted effective tax rate driven by higher rates in certain countries, including the impact of recent global minimum tax standards, and the geographic mix of earnings.\nOver the past four years, the Company used nearly $1.3 billion of cash to repurchase approximately nine million shares of PPG stock, including using $752 million to repurchase shares of PPG stock during 2024. The Company ended the year with approximately $2.8 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. During 2024, the Company deployed $721 million for capital expenditures, $622 million for dividends and $31 million for acquisitions. In 2024, PPG marked the 53rd annual per share dividend increase and the 125th successive year of annual dividend payments.\nPPG ended 2024 with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. The Company expects strong cash generation in 2025.\nRegulation G Reconciliations - Results from Operations\nPPG believes investors’ understanding of the Company’s performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income from continuing operations, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, PPG’s effective tax rate and segment income adjusted for certain items. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the Company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations.
