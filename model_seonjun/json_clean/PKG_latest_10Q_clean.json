In the third quarter of 2025, export and domestic containerboard outside shipments decreased (15.5%) compared to the third quarter of 2024. Our total corrugated products shipments from the legacy PCA business were down 2.7% per day and down 1.1% overall, compared to the same period in 2024. Including the acquired business, shipments were up 3.7% per day and 5.3% in total. In the third quarter of 2025, our domestic containerboard prices were 3.3% higher, while export prices were 3.2% higher than the same period in 2024.\nNet sales increased $2 million, or 1.2%, to $161 million, compared to $159 million in the third quarter of 2024, due to higher prices and mix ($3 million), partially offset by lower volume ($1 million).\n\nPackaging segment operating income increased $7 million to $328 million, compared to $321 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase related primarily to higher containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix ($87 million), lower fiber costs ($20 million), and lower maintenance outage expenses ($1 million), partially offset by higher operating and converting costs ($35 million), lower sales and production volumes ($20 million), higher depreciation expense ($8 million), higher freight expenses ($8 million), higher fixed and other expense ($5 million) and the impact of newly acquired Greif operations ($5 million). The third quarter of 2025 included $20 million of special items expense related to the Greif Acquisition and corrugated facility closures, compared to $1 million of special items expense related to corrugated products facility costs in the third quarter of 2024.\nPaper segment operating income decreased $3 million to $36 million, compared to $39 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease primarily related to higher operating costs ($4 million), lower volumes ($1 million), and higher fixed and other expense ($1 million), partially offset by higher prices and mix ($3 million). There were no significant special items in the third quarter of 2025 or 2024.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, includes $1.3 million of charges and $17.5 million of income, respectively, related to the closure of certain corrugated products facilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, the charges were partially offset by a gain on an asset disposal related to a closed corrugated products facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the charges were completely offset by gains on sales of corrugated products facilities during the second quarter of 2025. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes $0.9 million and $1.0 million of charges, respectively, consisting of closure costs related to corrugated products facilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these charges were partially offset by income primarily related to a favorable lease buyout for a closed corrugated products facility during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, includes charges consisting of closure costs related to corrugated products facilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, the charges were partially offset by a gain on an asset disposal related to a closed corrugated products facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, these charges were completely offset by gains from the sales of corrugated products facilities during the second quarter of 2025. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes charges consisting of closure costs related to corrugated products facilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these charges were partially offset by income primarily related to a favorable lease buyout for a closed corrugated products facility during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\nthe impact of general economic conditions;\nthe impact of acquired businesses and risks and uncertainties regarding operation, expected benefits and integration of such businesses;\ncontainerboard, corrugated products, and white paper general industry conditions, including competition, product demand, product pricing, and input costs;\nfluctuations in wood fiber and recycled fiber costs;\nfluctuations in purchased energy costs;\nthe possibility of unplanned outages or interruptions at our principal facilities; and\ngovernmental, legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, particularly concerning environmental or tax matters or trade policy.\n\nPCA is the third largest producer of containerboard products and a leading producer of UFS paper in North America. We operate ten mills and 93 corrugated products manufacturing plants. Our containerboard mills produce linerboard and corrugating medium, which are papers primarily used in the production of corrugated products. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations, and honeycomb protective packaging. In addition, we are a large producer of packaging for meat, fresh fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and other industrial and consumer products. We also manufacture and sell UFS papers, including both commodity and specialty papers, which may have custom or specialized features such as colors, coatings, high brightness, and recycled content. We are headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois and operate primarily in the United States.\nOn September 2, 2025, we completed the acquisition of the containerboard business of Greif, Inc. (“Greif”) for $1.8 billion in cash (the “Greif Acquisition”). The Greif containerboard business includes two containerboard mills with approximately 800,000 tons of production capacity and eight sheet feeder and corrugated plants located across the United States. The operating results of the Greif Acquisition are included in PCA’s results in the Packaging segment after the date of acquisition.\nIncluded in this Item 2 are various non-GAAP financial measures, including earnings per diluted share excluding special items, net income excluding special items, earnings before non-operating pension income, interest, income taxes, and depreciation, amortization, and depletion (“EBITDA”), segment EBITDA, EBITDA excluding special items, and segment EBITDA excluding special items. We provide important disclosures regarding our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of presented non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures presented in accordance with GAAP later in this section under the caption “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n\nThird quarter net sales were $2.31 billion in 2025 and $2.18 billion in 2024. We reported $227 million of net income, or $2.51 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2025, compared to $238 million, or $2.64 per diluted share, during the same period in 2024. Net income included $20 million of expense for special items in the third quarter of 2025 primarily relating to charges and costs relating to the Greif Acquisition, compared to $1 million of expense for special items in 2024. Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” elsewhere in this Item 2 for a description of special items. Excluding special items, net income was $247 million, or $2.73 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2025, compared to $239 million, or $2.65 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe increase was driven by improvement in legacy PCA’s earnings by $0.19 per share, partially offset by a loss of ($0.11) per share for the first month of ownership of the Greif containerboard business. The results of the acquired business included approximately $12 million of depreciation and amortization expense and $8 million of additional interest expense, primarily from new borrowings to finance the acquisition. The increase in the earnings of the legacy PCA business was driven primarily by higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment, lower fiber costs, higher prices and mix in the Paper segment and lower maintenance outage expense. These items were partially offset by higher operating costs, lower production and sales volume in the Packaging segment, higher depreciation expense, higher freight expense, higher fixed and other expense, higher interest expense and lower production volume in the Paper segment. For additional detail on special items included in reported GAAP results and other non-GAAP measures, see “Item 2. Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nPackaging segment operating income was $328 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $321 million in the third quarter of 2024. Packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was $492 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $446 million in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe increase in EBITDA, excluding special items, was due to higher prices and mix, lower fiber costs, and lower maintenance outage expense, partially offset by higher operating and converting costs, lower production and sales volumes, higher freight and logistics expense, and higher fixed and other expense. Prices and mix reflected our 2025 price increases for containerboard and corrugated pr"
