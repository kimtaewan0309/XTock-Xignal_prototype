MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs part of our mission, we believe that minimally invasive care is life-enhancing care. Since our founding 30 years ago, we have been delivering on this mission by combining innovative technology with clinical expertise to advance minimally invasive care. We do so by providing a comprehensive ecosystem that includes robotic-assisted systems, instruments and accessories, customer learning, and support services all connected by a digital portfolio that enables actionable insights across the care continuum.\nTo ensure continued alignment with the patients and healthcare communities we serve, we have adopted the Quintuple Aim as our “north star.” Starting foremost with a focus on patients, we seek to demonstrate that our products can deliver better outcomes that are validated by rigorous peer-reviewed evidence. Second, we aim to work with clinicians and care teams to create better patient experiences that enable patients to more quickly get back to what matters most in their lives, with fewer complications, less pain and discomfort, and greater predictability. Third, we aim to enable the care teams who use our platforms and technology-enabled ecosystem to have better experiences that augment their skills while reducing fatigue and increasing efficiency and reliability. Fourth, we aim to help lower the total cost of care per patient episode when compared with existing treatment alternatives, providing a return on investment for hospitals and healthcare systems and value for payers. Lastly, we aim to expand access to high-quality minimally invasive care by partnering with hospitals, healthcare systems, and patient advocacy groups to address barriers to care.\nWhile surgery and acute interventions have improved significantly in the past few decades, there remains a significant need to improve across all aspects of the Quintuple Aim. Stakeholders continue to expect better clinical outcomes and decreased variability of outcomes across clinicians and care teams. Globally, some healthcare systems continue to be stressed and lacking in critical resources, including the professionals who staff care teams. At the same time, healthcare providers, payers, and governments strain to cover the healthcare needs of their aging populations and demand lower total cost per patient to treat disease. In the face of these challenges, we continue to believe that we are well-positioned to synthesize scientific and technological advances in biology, computing, imaging, algorithms, and robotics to deliver meaningful and measurable value to all of our stakeholders.\nGlobally, open surgery remains a prevalent form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body. However, the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to patients, typically resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times, increased hospitalization costs, and additional pain and suffering relative to minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”), where MIS is available. For over four decades, MIS has reduced trauma to patients by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions. MIS has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures.\nDa Vinci surgical systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of MIS to many patients who would otherwise undergo a more invasive surgery by using computational, robotic, and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of traditional open surgery or conventional MIS. Surgeons using a da Vinci surgical system operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a 3D, high-definition image of the surgical field. This immersive console connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments. While seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to open surgical technique. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of articulation of the surgical instruments used in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon’s hand. In designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use.\nOur da Vinci products fall into five broad categories: da Vinci surgical systems, da Vinci instruments and accessories, da Vinci stapling, da Vinci energy, and da Vinci vision, including Firefly fluorescence imaging systems and da Vinci endoscopes. We provide a comprehensive suite of systems, learning, and services offerings. Digitally enabled for nearly three decades, these three offerings aim to decrease variability by providing dependable, consistent functionality and an integrated user experience. Our systems category includes robotic platforms, software, vision, energy, and instruments and accessories. Our learning category includes learning and enabling technology, such as simulation and telepresence, as well as technical training programs and personalized peer-to-peer learning opportunities. We have a global network of field service engineers and distributors through which we deliver a suite of services, including installation, repair, maintenance, around-the-clock technical support, and system monitoring. We also offer customized analytics and consultation to hospitals for program optimization.\nWe have commercialized the following da Vinci surgical systems: the da Vinci standard surgical system in 1999, the da Vinci S surgical system in 2006, the da Vinci Si surgical system in 2009, the fourth-generation da Vinci Xi surgical system in 2014, and the fifth-generation da Vinci 5 surgical system in 2024. We extended our fourth-generation platform by adding the da Vinci X surgical system, commercialized in 2017 and targeted at more cost-sensitive markets.\nIn March 2024, we obtained FDA clearance for our da Vinci 5 surgical system, our next-generation multi-port robotic system, for use in all surgical specialties and procedures indicated for da Vinci Xi, except for cardiac and pediatric indications. In October 2024, we obtained regulatory clearance in South Korea for the da Vinci 5 surgical system for use in urologic, general, gynecologic, thoracoscopic, thoracoscopically-assisted cardiotomy, and transoral otolaryngology surgical procedures. In June 2025, we obtained regulatory clearance in Japan for the da Vinci 5 surgical system for use in all surgical specialties and\nprocedures indicated for da Vinci Xi, except for cardiac indications. In July 2025, we obtained European certification in accordance with the EU MDR for the da Vinci 5 surgical system for adult and pediatric use in minimally invasive endoscopic procedures across abdominopelvic and thoracoscopic surgical procedures, including urologic, gynecologic, and general laparoscopic procedures, excluding the use of force feedback. We intend to seek European certification for the use of force feedback in the future. In our markets outside of the U.S. (“OUS”), we are in the midst of a phased launch of our da Vinci 5 surgical system, which we expect to extend over several quarters, giving us time to mature our supply and manufacturing processes for the new system. As of September 30, 2025, we have an installed base of 929 da Vinci 5 surgical systems.\nAdditionally, we extended our fourth-generation platform by adding the da Vinci SP surgical system, commercialized in 2018. The da Vinci SP surgical system accesses the body through a single incision, while the other da Vinci surgical systems access the body through multiple incisions. All da Vinci systems include a surgeon’s console (or consoles), imaging electronics, a patient-side cart, and computational hardware and software.\nWe are in the early stages of launching our da Vinci SP surgical system and have an installed base of 343 da Vinci SP surgical systems as of September 30, 2025. We have received FDA clearance for the da Vinci SP surgical system for urologic, colorectal, general thoracoscopic, and certain transoral procedures. Additionally, the da Vinci SP surgical system has received regulatory clearance in South Korea for a broad set of procedures. The da Vinci SP surgical system has also received regulatory clearance in Japan for the same set of procedures that are currently allowed with the da Vinci Xi surgical system in Japan. In January 2024, the da Vinci SP surgical system received European certification in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices (the “EU MDR”) for use in endoscopic abdominopelvic, thoracoscopic, transoral otolaryngology, transanal colorectal, and breast surgical procedures, and we are commercializing the da Vinci SP surgical system in select major European countries as part of a measured rollout. In August 2024, we obtained regulatory clearance in Taiwan for our da Vinci SP surgical system for use in endoscopic abdominopelvic, thoracoscopic, transoral otolaryngology, transanal colorectal, transanal total mesorectal excision, and breast surgical procedures. We plan to seek FDA clearances for additional indications for the da Vinci SP surgical system and expand the system’s regulatory approvals (including for additional indications) in other OUS markets over time. The success of the da Vinci SP surgical system is dependent on positive experiences and improved clinical outcomes for the procedures for which it has been cleared as well as securing additional clinical clearances.\nWe offer approximately 70 different multi-port da Vinci instruments to provide surgeons with flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed to perform a particular surgery. These multi-port instruments are generally robotically controlled and provide end effectors (tips) that are similar to those used in either open or laparoscopic surgery. We offer advanced instrumentation for the da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, and da Vinci Xi surgical systems, including da Vinci energ"
