  "item1_clean": "We now operate in one segment, Insurance, which primarily serves our P&C insurance customers across most personal and commercial lines of business, focusing on the fundamental building blocks of insurance programs, the prediction of loss, the selection and pricing of risk, and compliance with their reporting requirements in each U.S. state in which they operate. We also develop and utilize machine-learned and artificially intelligent models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better manage their businesses, including detecting fraud before and after a loss event and quantifying losses. Our customers, acquired over more than 50 years, include most of the P&C insurance providers in the U.S. In recent years, we have expanded our offerings to serve certain non-U.S. markets and into the fields of life insurance and annuities, as well as insurance marketing. We offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term agreements, which are typically prepaid (annually and quarterly) and represented approximately 81% of our revenues in 2024. We believe we are well positioned to increase our penetration of the global insurance industry because of our proprietary data assets, long-standing industry relationships, deep insurance industry expertise, and our scale to drive broad distribution of our new innovations.\n\nAccount Executives play a key role in both sales and customer service activities. They provide direct support to assigned customers, engaging frequently to ensure a positive experience with our services. While Account Executives primarily focus on identifying new sales opportunities, they collaborate closely with various teams to align our solutions with customer needs. We believe our deep solutions knowledge, ability to build trusted relationships, and local presence set us apart from the competition. Subject Matter Experts partner with Account Executives on specific opportunities related to their assigned solutions and market segments. Account Executives manage the overall sales process, while Subject Matter Experts manage the detailed integration and functional discussions to ensure successful outcomes and customer satisfaction. Both Account Executives and Subject Matter Experts are responsible for identifying new sales opportunities as well as managing renewals of existing business. A team-based approach, supported by a unified customer relationship management system, ensures effective coordination across all groups.\n\nWe operate primarily in the U.S. P&C insurance industry. We have a number of competitors in specific lines or services. We encounter competition from a number of sources, including insurers that develop internal technology and actuarial methods for proprietary insurance programs. Competitors also include other statistical agents and other advisory organizations, that provide underwriting rules, prospective loss costs, and coverage language. Competitors for our property-specific rating and underwriting information are primarily regional providers of commercial property inspections and surveys as well as emerging providers in the InsurTech space. We also compete with a variety of organizations that offer consulting services, primarily specialty technology and consulting firms. In addition, a customer may use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these services. Our underwriting solutions compete with a variety of companies in the marketplace. Our competitors include information technology product and services vendors; management and strategy consulting firms; and smaller specialized information technology and analytical services firms. Finally, in the life insurance sector, our solutions compete against numerous independent vendors, as well as the in-house technology departments of Life Insurers. In the P&C insurance claims and catastrophe modeling markets, certain products are offered by a number of companies in the areas of catastrophe modeling, repair cost estimating, claims investigative reports, claims fraud analytics, and injury claims analytics. We believe that our P&C insurance industry expertise, and our ability to offer multiple applications, services, and integrated solutions to individual customers are competitive strengths.\n\nTo optimize account management for our largest customers, we segment our client base into three distinct tiers. Tier One consists of our most significant customers. To ensure strategic and executive-level engagement with these Tier One clients, a Managing Director within the Client Strategy organization is responsible for the overall and executive-level relationship between the client and all of Verisk, fostering alignment across our solutions and services. Tier Two clients encompass both large and middle-market customer groups. Tier Three consists of smaller, specialized companies that may focus on a single line of business, serve specific regions, or be recent entrants to the market. Within the Tier One and Tier Two segments, our US and global sales teams are organized by the following disciplines: personal lines underwriting and pricing, commercial lines underwriting and pricing, claims, catastrophe modeling and exposure management, and specialty. For Tier Three clients, a generalist Account Executive is assigned within each business unit, taking on overall account management responsibilities. Our tiered approach has proven to be an effective sales model for building strong customer relationships. Additionally, our senior leadership team, including the Senior Operating Committee, regularly engages with senior management at our client organizations to ensure strategic alignment, and to foster opportunities for mutual partnership and innovation.\n\nOur operating segments have historically been Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets, and Financial Services. On March 11, 2022 and April 8, 2022, we sold 3E Company Environmental, Ecological and Engineering (\"3E\"), our environmental health and safety business, which represented the “specialized markets” in our Energy and Specialized Markets segment, and our Financial Services segment, respectively. We assessed the sale of 3E and Financial Services segment per the guidance in ASC 205-20,\nDiscontinued Operations\n(\"ASC 205-20\"), and determined that the transactions did not qualify as a discontinued operation because they did not, quantitatively or qualitatively, represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. On October 28, 2022, we also entered into an equity purchase agreement to sell Wood Mackenzie, Inc. and Verisk New UK Holdco LP (together with their respective subsidiaries, our “Energy business”). The transaction closed on February 1, 2023. The Energy business qualified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2022 and was classified as a discontinued operation per the guidance in ASC 205-20, as we determined that this transaction represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and assets and liabilities held for sale for all periods presented. Results of our Energy business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for all prior periods presented. See\n. Dispositions and Discontinued Operation for further discussion.\n\nWe continue to expand our footprint of data and solutions to include international markets. Our international insurance markets grew through acquisitions and today serve a large number of insurers operating in the Canadian, United Kingdom (U.K.) and Irish property and casualty markets, and travel market. Additionally, our international market provides services to much of the Lloyd's of London market, while also serving clients in Continental Europe, Singapore, China, Australia, and New Zealand. The international enhanced commercial and residential property models and enriched data sets help insurers with triage, reconstruction value, risk selection, pricing, benchmarking, and portfolio management across multiple insured segments. Insurers also use our solutions to help fine-tune the accuracy of their rating models and to enhance underwriting results through a set of analytical solutions that predict the relative risk and variation of major insurance perils, including theft, flood, storm, fire, freeze, etc. In addition to property data and solutions, clients can benefit from decision and benchmarking analytics using firmographic, technographic, and business intelligence and proprietary management competency scores, delivered digitally to enable straight through processing. Our suite of international solutions also includes rating tools that automate the assessment of pre-existing conditions, helping travel and health insurers to get a broad view of a customer's medical risk and make underwriting decisions with speed and precision.\n\nWe own a significant number of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and patents. Specifically, our policy language, insurance manuals, software, and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights. and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue. We also own in excess of 600 trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our solutions and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered. We believe many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos to be of material importance to our business, as they assist our customers in identifying our solutions and services and the quality that stands behind them. We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (for example, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and patent) and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect it wherever it is used.\n\nUp until the sale of our Energy business on February 1, 2023, we were a leading provider of data analytics across the natural resources value chain including the global energy, chemicals, metals and mining, and power and renewables sectors. We delivered analysis and advice on assets, companies, governments, and markets based on proprietary near real time data as well as historic information. This enabled us to offer a comprehensive and integrated analysis of relevant commodities to our customers. We provided research and consulting services focusing on supporting customer capital allocation decisions, asset valuation and benchmarking, commodity markets, and corporate analysis. We offered consultancy in the areas of business environment, business improvement, business strategies, commercial advisory, and transaction support.\n\nthe sale of Financials Services Segment on April 8, 2022, we maintained the largest bank account consortia to provide competitive benchmarking, decisioning algorithms, business intelligence, and customized analytic services to financial institutions, payment networks and processors, alternative lenders, regulators, and merchants enabling better strategy, marketing, and risk decisions. We delivered unique solutions and services to an expanding customer base that valued the comprehensiveness of our data and solutions as well as our full wallet-spend view of a consumer. Complementing this, we leveraged our partnerships with processors and credit bureaus not only to augment the richness of our data but also to provide expanded solutions across the broad span of consumer banking and retail solutions.\n\nWe take a market-focused team approach to developing our solutions. Our operating units are responsible for developing, r",

Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for an increase of $22.7 million in SGA. This increase was primarily due to an acquisition-related earn-out credit of $20.0 million in the prior year that did not recur in the current period. The offsetting decrease of $\n% was primarily due to a\nprior year litigation reserve expense of $38.2 million related to our former Financial Services segment, decreases in fees and membership costs of $3.2 million, bad debt expense of $1.1 million, and other operating costs of $1.2 million, partially offset by an\nincrease in professional consulting fees of $15.8 million\n, salaries and employee benefits of $12.3 million, a $6.5 million loss on the disposal of assets primarily due to a write-off of leasehold improvements related to our lease modification, increases in insurance expense of $2.0 million, and information technology expense of $1.3 million.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SGA\") were $391.8 million for the year ended\ncompared to $381.5 million for the year ended\n, an increase of $10.3 million or 2.7%. Our recent acquisitions, primarily related to salaries and benefits of $24.5 million, contributed to the increase, offset by our recent dispositions and acquisition-related earn-out costs, which accounted for decreases of $34.1 million and $16.5 million, respectively. The remaining SGA increase of $36.4 million or 10.0% was primarily due to a litigation reserve expense of $38.2 million associated with an indemnification of an ongoing inquiry related to our former Financial Services segment, increases in travel expenses of $3.9 million, professional consulting fees (mostly related to ERP costs) of $3.4 million, information technology expenses of $0.6 million, and other operating costs of $0.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $10.6 million.\n\nenues was $876.5 million for the year ended\ncompared to $824.6 million for the year ended\n, an increase of $51.9 million or 6.3%. Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for a net decrease of $16.5 million in cost of revenues, which was primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. The cost of revenues increase of $68.4 million or 8.7% was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $51.0 million, rent expense of $6.6 million, bad debt expense of $3.8 million, travel expenses of $3.6 million, data costs of $1.8 million, and other operating costs of $3.9 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in information technology expenses of $2.1 million and professional consulting fees $0.2 million\n\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefits, stock-based compensation, and income taxes. Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.\n\nEBITDA.\nWe use year-over-year EBITDA growth as a key performance metric. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets. We calculate EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. The respective nearest applicable GAAP financial measures are net income and net income margin. Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders, and others in their evaluation of companies; EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating income, net income, or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP. Management uses EBITDA and EBITDA margin in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment company performance. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Some of these limitations involved in the use of EBITDA are:\n\nWhile we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues. Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses. However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses, which may offset margin expansion.\n\nmillion for the year ended\nmillion for the year ended\n. The growth in our revenues was partially offset by the sale of 3E and our Financial Services segment, both of which did not qualify as discontinued operations and as a result, their prior year revenues of $60.0 million were included in our results. Our recent acquisitions (Morning Data within the underwriting category of our Insurance segment; and Mavera and Krug within the claims category of the Insurance segment) increased net revenues by $32.4 million. The remaining growth in revenues of $212.0 million or 8.7% is related to increased revenues within our Insurance segment. Refer to the Results of Operations by Segment within this section for more information regarding our revenues. Our Specialized Market business was sold in March 2022; and our Energy business, which qualified for discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2022, was subsequently sold in Februar\ny 2023. Our Financial Services segment was sold in April 2022. Our Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services segments did not have revenues from\n\nThese trends in catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses (such as from weather, climate, casualty, terrorism, pandemics, and tsunamis) can influence our customers’ profitability, and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks. Any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of these events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions. Likewise, any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products. A portion of our revenue is also related to the number of claims processed due to losses, which can be impacted by seasonal storm or wildfire activity. The need by our customers to fight insurance fraud - both in claims and at policy inception - could also lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.\n\nThe net income margin for our consolidated results was 33.2% for the year ended\ncompared to 22.9% for the year ended\n. The increase in net income margin was primarily driven by net gains associated with the settlement of retained interests related to the prior sales of our healthcare business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022, the early extinguishment of debt, discussed above, and a prior year litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment, partially offset by the loss recognized on the sale of AER. The net income margin for December 31, 2023 included a loss from discontinued operations of $154.0 million, which negatively impacted our net income margin by 5.7%.\n\nWe assign personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee. We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, salespeople, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses. A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.\n\nWe have a $1,000 million Syndicated Credit Facility with Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., TD Bank, N.A., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and the Northern Trust Company with a maturity date of April 5, 2028. Borrowing under the facility is payable at an interest rate of SOFR plus 100.0 to 162.5 basis points, depending on the public debt rating. The financial covenants require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of less than 3.75 to 1.0\nAt our election, the maximum consolidated funded debt leverage ratio could be permitted to increase to 4.50 to 1.0 (no more than once) and to 4.25 to 1.0 (no more than once) in connection with the closing of a permitted acquisition. The Syndicated Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, and the Repurchase Program. As of\n, we were in compliance with all financial and other debt covenants under the Syndicated Credit Facility. As of\n, the available capacity under the Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility was $995.4 million, which takes into account outstanding letters of credit of $4.6 million.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment. Our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 60% debt securities and 40% equity securities. As of December 31, 2024, the pension plan assets were allocated 57.5% debt securities, 36.5% equity securities, 4.9% real estate and 1.1% other. The VEBA Plan target allocation is 100% debt securities. We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan. The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit (credits) costs. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\nWe capitalize certain development costs incurred in connection with internally developed software. These capitalized costs primarily pertain to software hosted by us and accessed by customers. Costs during the initial development stages are expensed as they occur. Once an application reaches the development stage, both internal and external costs are capitalized if they are direct and incremental, until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization stops upon completion of all significant testing. Additionally, we capitalize costs associated with specific software upgrades and enhancements when the expenditures result in additional features and functionality. Once in service, internally developed software assets are assessed for recoverability and impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Any impairment, as identified, is calculated as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value, using acceptable valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as circumstances require.\n\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. The estimates used in valuing the intangible assets are determined with the assistance of third-party specialists, a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\nPersonnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel expenses, which represented approximately 56% and 57% of our total operating expenses (excluding gains/losses related to dispositions) for each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs\n, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.\n\nEBITDA was $1,659.1 million for the year ended\ncompared to $1,424.1 million for the year ended\n. The EBITDA margin for our consolidated results was\n% for the year ended\ncompared to 53.1% for the year ended\n. The increase was primarily driven by strong revenue growth and cost discipline, a prior year litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment, and net gains associated with the prior sales of our healthcare business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022.\n\nmillion, data costs of $\nmillion, bad debt expense of $\nmillion, and fees and membership costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in rent expense of $3.3 million, a decrease of $2.2 million on the disposal of fixed assets, $1.5 million gain primarily related to our Jersey City lease modification, decreases in office expense of $\nmillion, insurance expense of $0.7 million, professional consulting fees of $0.5 million, and other operating costs of $0.3 million.\n\nInterest expense was $115.5 million for the year ended\ncompared to $138.8 million for the year ended\n, a decrease of $23.3 million or 16.8%. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the paydown in the current year of our outstanding borrowings on our Syndicated Revolving and Bilateral credit facilities, and an increase in interest income of $15.8 million, partially offset by interest expense related to the issuance of our 2033 Senior Notes",
