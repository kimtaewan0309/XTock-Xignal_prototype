The Company’s merchandise business is comprised of shipments in the following diverse markets: chemicals, agricultural and food products, automotive, minerals, forest products, metals and equipment, and fertilizers.\nThe intermodal business shipped 2.9 million units (46% of volume) and generated $2.0 billion in revenue (14% of revenue) in 2024. The intermodal business combines the superior economics of rail transportation with the flexibility of trucks and offers a cost and environmental advantage over long-haul trucking. Through a network of approximately 30 terminals, the intermodal business serves all major markets east of the Mississippi River and transports mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers, providing customers with truck-like service for longer shipments.\nThe coal business shipped 736 thousand carloads (12% of volume) and generated $2.2 billion in revenue (15% of revenue) in 2024. The Company transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel manufacturers and industrial plants as well as export coal to deep-water port facilities. Most of the export coal the Company transports is used for steelmaking, while the majority of domestic coal the Company ships is used for electricity generation.\nThe trucking business generated $844 million, or 6%, of revenue in 2024. Trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of Quality Carriers.\nOther revenue accounted for 4% of the Company’s total revenue in 2024. This category includes revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and incidental charges, including intermodal storage and equipment usage, demurrage and switching. Revenue from regional subsidiary railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage represents charges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified period of time. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad.\nCSX's Committed Workforce\nMost of the Company’s employees provide or support transportation services. The Company had more than 23,500 employees as of December 2024, which includes approximately 17,500 employees that are members of a rail labor union. There are 12 rail unions at CSX that participate in national bargaining. As of December 2, 2022, all of these rail unions were covered by national agreements with the Class I railroads and CSX-specific agreements that remained in effect through December 31, 2024. Collective agreements under the Railway Labor Act do not expire, but continue until amended. Prior to the 2022 agreements becoming amendable, CSX worked with several major rail unions on new five-year labor agreements. As of the date of this filing, new labor agreements have been fully ratified by seven unions representing approximately 40% of the Company's unionized workforce.\nCSX prioritizes workplace safety for employees and is committed to continued improvement through enhanced processes, training, technology, communication, and continuous collaboration with customers and peers across the railroad industry. Training programs and processes are focused on injury and accident prevention as well as emergency preparedness. Additionally, the attainment of key safety targets is a component of management's annual incentive program. The FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index, a measure of the number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours, was 1.19 in 2024 and 0.94 in 2023.\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\nThe Compensation and Talent Management Committee of the Board of Directors is charged with oversight of CSX's workforce. The Company is committed to developing a culture that promotes workforce diversity and inclusion and encourages ethical behavior. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 22% of CSX's overall workforce and 35% of management was diverse, calculated as the percentage of males of color and all females. In 2024, CSX was recognized as a “Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion” by Disability:IN and the American Association of People with Disabilities for a sixth consecutive year after receiving a top score on their disability equality index. The CSX Code of Ethics serves as a guiding standard for ethical behavior and covers many types of matters, including discrimination and harassment as well as safety. Annually, all management employees are required, and union employees are highly encouraged, to complete ethics training.\nA leader in freight rail transportation for nearly 200 years, the Company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (“B&O”), the nation’s first common carrier, was chartered in 1827. Since that time, the Company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the ever-increasing demands of a growing nation. Since its founding, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&O through merger and consolidation to create what has become CSX. Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors.\nCSX Corporation was incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries into CSX. The merger allowed the Company to connect northern population centers and Appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets. Later, the Company’s acquisition of key portions of Conrail, Inc. (\"Conrail\") allowed CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area, with Chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the Southeast already served by CSXT. This current rail network, which now includes the network acquired from Pan Am, allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with safe, dependable, environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service.\nThe business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive. Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price. Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads, motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines.\nCSXT’s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the Company’s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels. For further discussion on the risk of competition to the Company, see Item 1A.\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\nRegulatory Environment\nThe Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the United States and Canada. In the U.S., the railroad operations conducted by the Company's subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and its sister agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). Together, FRA and PHMSA have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars, locomotives and hazardous materials requirements. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the Company's properties and operations.\nThe Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), a component of the Department of Homeland Security, has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications. In Canada, the railroad operations conducted by the Company’s subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency.\nAlthough the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated the U.S. rail industry, the STB has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers. The STB regulates routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, rates for non-exempt traffic, acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, among other railroad activities. Any new rules from the STB regarding, among other things, competitive access or revenue adequacy could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure. For further discussion on regulatory risks to the Company, see Item 1A.\nFinancial Information\nInformation regarding the Company's results of operations and financial position can be found in Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCSX makes available on its website\n\nCSX Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (\"CSX\" or the “Company”), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation companies. The Company provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers, as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations. CSX and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the long-term economic success and improved global competitiveness of the United States. In addition, freight railroads provide the most economical and environmentally efficient means to transport goods over land.\nCSX Transportation, Inc.\nCSX’s principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 20,000 route-mile rail network and serves major population centers in 26 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It has access to over 70 ocean, river and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. This access allows the Company to meet the dynamic transportation needs of manufacturers, industrial producers, the automotive industry, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers, and energy producers. The Company’s intermodal business links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. CSXT also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections with other Class I railroads and more than 240 short-line and regional railroads. On June 1, 2022, CSX completed its acquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc. (“Pan Am”), which is the parent company of Pan Am Railways, Inc. This acquisition expanded CSXT’s reach in the Northeastern United States. For further details, refer to Note 17,\nBusiness Combinations.\nCSXT is also responsible for the Company's real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities. Substantially all of these activities are focused on supporting railroad operations.\nIn addition to CSXT, the Company’s subsidiaries include Quality Carriers",
  "item7_clean": "The weighted average discount rate used by the Company to value its pension obligations was 5.50% and 4.82% as of December 2024, and December 2023, respectively. As of December 2024, the estimated duration of pension benefits is approximately 9 years.\nEach year, the discount rate is reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rate will change.\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCritical Accounting Estimates,\nLong-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management, with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75% in both 2024 and 2023.\nThe calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover, retirement age and salary inflation rates. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.\n2025 Estimated Pension Expense\nNet periodic pension benefit expense for 2025 is expected to be a credit of $7 million. Net periodic pension benefit expense for 2025 is expected to include service cost expense of $21 million. Service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense are included in other income - net. Net periodic pension expense in 2024 was a credit of $20 million. The net decrease in the expected credit is primarily due to recent less favorable plan asset experience.\nThe following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a 1% change in certain assumptions on the 2025 estimated pension expense:\n(Dollars in Millions)\nLong-term Rate of Return\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCritical Accounting Estimates,\nDepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method\nThe depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 86% of total fixed assets of $52.2 billion on a gross basis at December 31, 2024. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis\nLand is not depreciated.\nManagement performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:\nstatistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;\nstatistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;\nevaluation of current operations;\nevaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;\nprevious assessment of the condition of the assets;\nmanagement's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;\nexpected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and\ncomparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.\nThe STB requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). The Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2022, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. The 2022 equipment study resulted in an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $80 million primarily due to deferred losses on assets depreciated using the group-life method. The Company plans to complete the next depreciation study for equipment assets in 2025.\nA 1% change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $14 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. There were no significant changes to the Company's asset lives as a result of the 2022 and 2020 studies. For additional details, including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies, see Note 6,\nin the consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy\nNature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies,\nunder the caption “New Accounting Pronouncements.”\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nprojections and estimates of earnings, revenues, margins, volumes, rates, cost-savings, expenses, taxes or other financial items;\nexpectations as to results of operations and operational initiatives;\nexpectations as to the effect of claims, lawsuits, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, labor negotiations or agreements on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity;\nmanagement's plans, strategies and objectives for future operations, capital expenditures, workforce levels, dividends, share repurchases, safety and service performance, proposed new services and other matters that are not historical facts, and management's expectations as to future performance and operations and the time by which objectives will be achieved; and\nfuture economic, industry or market conditions or performance and their effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nForward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as \"will,\" \"should,\" “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate,” “preliminary” and similar expressions. The Company cautions against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect its good faith beliefs with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to it as of the date the forward-looking statement is made. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the timing when, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved.\n\nexpenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services, purchased trucking and other transportation, and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. Total purchased services and other expenses increased $50 million driven by the following:\nAn increase of $17 million was due to impairments of technology and non-rail equipment, partially offset by prior year inventory adjustments.\nAn increase of $17 million was due to higher operating support costs, which were primarily due to inflation and higher intermodal volumes. These increases were partially offset by efficiency savings.\nAll other costs increased $16 million as a result of $37 million lower insurance recoveries, other inflation impacts, and non-significant increases, which were partially offset by a $20 million favorable legal settlement and other cost savings.\nexpense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $51 million primarily due to a larger net asset base.\nexpense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense decreased $209 million primarily due to a 13% decrease in locomotive fuel prices and improved efficiency.\nEquipment and Other Rents\nexpense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $1 million primarily due to increased net car hire costs offset by other non-significant items.\nexpense for Quality Carriers was $108 million for 2024.\nGains on Property Dispositions\ndecreased to $11 million in 2024 from $34 million in 2023.\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nInterest Expense includes interest on long-term debt and related fair value hedges, equipment obligations and finance leases. Interest expense increased $23 million primarily as a result of higher average debt balances.\nOther Income - Net includes investment gains, losses, interest income, components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. Other income increased $3 million primarily due to increases in net pension benefit credits partially offset by lower income related to customer finance charges and a decrease in investment gains.\nIncome Tax Expense decreased $76 million primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes.\nNet Earnings and Earnings per Diluted Share\nNet Earnings decreased $198 million to $3.5 billion, and earnings per diluted share decreased $0.03 to $1.79, due to the factors mentioned above. Average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nAdjusted Operating Results\nManagement believes that adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted net earnings per share, assuming dilution are important in evaluating the Company's performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability. These non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude the fourth quarter 2024 non-cash impairment of Quality Carriers' goodwill, which is a significant item that is not considered indicative of future financial trends. The goodwill impairment was tax effected using rates reflective of the applicable tax amounts related to the impairment charge. These adjusted results should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP operating results.\nThe following tables reconcile the Company's GAAP operating results for the year ended December 31, 2024 to adjusted operating results (non-GAAP measures).\nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2024\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet Earnings Per Share, Assuming Dilution\nGAAP Operating Results\n\n(\"FCF\")\n- The calculation of a non-GAAP measure by using net cash provided by operating activities and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities.
