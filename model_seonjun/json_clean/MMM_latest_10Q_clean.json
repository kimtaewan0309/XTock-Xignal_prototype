These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the\nCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)\nOrganic sales change (which includes both organic volume and selling price impacts), is defined as the change in net sales, absent the impacts from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. 3M believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\nNet sales change was driven by strength in safety, general industrial, and electronics, partially offset by known softness in auto aftermarket, while consumer remained soft. Sales change also reflected the YoY impact of the manufactured PFAS products special item.\nGAAP\nGAAP\nOperating income margin\nYoY change in operating income margin\nGAAP operating margins were affected by the YoY impact of special items. These primarily included an increase in net costs for significant litigation impacting operating income from the second quarter 2025 PFAS-related New Jersey Settlement (discussed in Note 17), followed by a decrease in the third quarter resulting from insurance recoveries, a third quarter 2025 charge associated with divestiture activity (discussed in Note 4), and manufactured PFAS products. Both GAAP and adjusted operating margins reflect benefits from growth and productivity (outside of special items), and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by growth investments, as well as gross tariff and foreign currency impacts.\nAdditionally, margins YoY were impacted by cost dis-synergies (from the ongoing exit of PFAS manufacturing and second quarter 2024 spin of Solventum), and by transition service agreement reimbursement from Solventum, which began in the second quarter of 2024, and by the lower extent of stock-based compensation grants (see the\nCertain Expenses Impacting Multiple Line Items within Results of Operation\nGAAP\nGAAP\nEarning per diluted share (EPS)\nGAAP EPS YoY was negatively affected by the net impact of special items. In addition to items relative to operating income discussed above, this primarily included the YOY impact of the change in value of Solventum ownership and a $795 million pre-tax pension settlement charge in the second quarter 2024 (as discussed in Note 13), partially offset by lower imputed interest associated with obligations resulting from significant litigation. Both GAAP and adjusted EPS reflects benefits from growth and productivity (outside of special items) and lower restructuring costs, a second quarter 2025 gain on the sale of an investment (see the\nIncome from Unconsolidated Subsidiaries, Net of Taxes\ndiscussion below), and the impact of lower share count. These were partially offset by higher growth investments, gross tariff and foreign currency impacts, and a non-operating interest and pension headwind (apart from pension special item).\nAdditionally, EPS YoY was impacted by cost dis-synergies (from the ongoing exit of PFAS manufacturing and second quarter 2024 spin of Solventum), and by transition service agreement reimbursement from Solventum, which began in the second quarter of 2024, and by the lower extent of stock-based compensation grants.\n3M is progressing toward the exit of PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 as discussed Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this document. Decisions or circumstances associated with the extent and type of remaining non-PFAS activity at particular locations and impacts on assets and potential obligations, among other factors, could result in additional expenses.\nResults of Operations\nPercent change information compares the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, unless otherwise indicated. Discussion of business segment results is provided in the\nPerformance by Business Segment\nsection. Information regarding sales by geographic area is included below.\nThree months ended September 30, 2025\n\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with 3M's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 3M’s MD&A is presented in the following sections:\nResults of Operations\nPerformance by Business Segment\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nCautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results\nForward-looking statements in Part I, Item 2 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled\nCautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results\nin Part I, Item 2 and the risk factors provided in Part II, Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).\n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. As discussed in Note 1, certain changes are reflective in this document for all applicable periods presented.\nAs discussed in Note 2, on April 1, 2024, 3M completed the separation of its Health Care business (the Separation) through a pro rata distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Solventum Corporation (Solventum) to 3M stockholders. As a result, Solventum became an independent public company, 3M no longer consolidates Solventum into 3M’s financial results and the historical net income of Solventum, and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation are reported in 3M's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.\n3M manages its continuing operations in three operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, EMEA refers to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa on a combined basis.\nUnless otherwise noted, any sales change analysis compares the third quarter and the first nine months of 2025 with the corresponding periods in 2024, year-on-year (YoY).\nFinancial highlights for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025:\nGAAP\nGAAP\nNet sales (millions)\nOrganic sales change\n\nThe primary factors that increased the Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025, when compared to 2024, were the tax impacts of: 3M's retained ownership interest in Solventum, Pillar Two Model Rules, and the loss on business divestiture, partially offset by net costs of significant litigation. The primary factors that increased the Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, when compared to 2024, were the tax impact of: 3M's retained ownership interest in Solventum and Pillar Two Model Rules, partially offset by net costs of significant litigation.\nIncome from Unconsolidated Subsidiaries, Net of Taxes:\nIncome from unconsolidated subsidiaries, net of taxes\nIncome from unconsolidated subsidiaries, net of taxes, is attributable to the Company’s accounting under the equity method for ownership interests in certain entities. In the second quarter of 2025, 3M sold its interest in one of these investments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $47 million. Because this was an ownership disposition, the impact of taxes thereon was reflected separately in provision for income taxes.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest:\n\nThird quarter 2025 results:\nSales in Safety and Industrial were up 5.4 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in electrical markets, industrial adhesives and tapes, personal safety, abrasives and industrial specialties, and decreased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket.\nCommercial excellence helped drive growth, partially offset by continued softness in automotive aftermarket and emerging weakness in roofing granules.\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased YoY driven by benefits from growth, productivity, and lower restructuring costs. These benefits were partially offset by continued growth investments in the business, and cost dis-synergies from the ongoing exit of PFAS manufacturing.\nAdjusting for special item net costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure) related to respirator mask/asbestos, business segment operating income margins increased YoY from 24.3 percent to 26.3 percent. Refer to the\nCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures)\nsection below for additional details.\nFirst nine months 2025 results:\nSales in Safety and Industrial were up 3.2 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in electrical markets, industrial adhesives and tapes, personal safety, abrasives and industrial specialties, and decreased in automotive aftermarket and roofing granules.\nGrowth primarily came from demand in key underlying markets, partially offset by challenges in automotive aftermarket.\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and lower restructuring costs. These benefits were partially offset by continued growth investments in the business and cost dis-synergies due to the 2024 spin of Solventum and ongoing exit of PFAS manufacturing.\nAdjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure) related to respirator mask/asbestos, business segment operating income margins increased YoY from 23.7 percent to 25.9 percent.
