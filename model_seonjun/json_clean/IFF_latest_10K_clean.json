As a result, we hold global leadership positions in the Food & Beverage, Home & Personal Care and Health & Wellness markets, and across key Tastes, Textures, Scents, Nutrition, Enzymes, Cultures, Soy Proteins, Pharmaceutical Excipients and Probiotics categories.\nSales in 2024 were $11.484 billion. Our business is geographically diverse, with sales in the U.S. representing approximately\nof sales in 2024. No other country represented more than 10% of sales. In 2024, no customer accounted for 10% or more of sales.\nOur Product Offerings\nAs of December 31, 2024, our business consisted of four segments: Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions.\nAs a leading creator of ingredients and solutions, we help our customers deliver on the promise of healthy and delicious foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. We create products in our regional creative centers which allows us to satisfy local customer preferences, while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards. We develop thousands of different Nourish offerings, most of which are tailor-made, and we continually develop new ingredients and solutions to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs.\nOur Nourish segment consists of an innovative and broad portfolio of natural-based ingredients to enhance nutritional value, texture and functionality in a wide range of beverage, dairy, bakery, confectionery and culinary applications and consists of Ingredients and Flavors.\ninclude a diversified portfolio across natural and plant-based specialty food ingredients derived from herbs and plants that provide texturizing solutions used in the food industry, food protection solutions used in food and beverage products, as well as specialty soy and pea protein with value-added formulations, emulsifiers and sweeteners. Natural food protection ingredients consist of natural antioxidants and anti-microbials used for natural food preservation and shelf-life extension for beverages, cosmetic and healthcare products, pet food and feed additives. Ingredients also includes savory solutions (such as spices, marinades, mixtures) and inclusion products (such as products combining flavorings with fruit, vegetables and other natural ingredients), formerly part of\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we announced our entry into an agreement to sell a portion of the Savory Solutions business and completed the divestiture on May 31, 2023.\ninclude a range of flavor compounds and natural taste solutions that are ultimately used by our customers in savory products (soups, sauces, meat, fish, poultry, snacks, etc.), beverages (juice drinks, carbonated or flavored beverages, spirits, etc.), sweets (bakery products, candy, cereal, chewing gum, etc.), and dairy products (yogurt, ice cream, cheese, etc.). Flavors also include value-added spices and seasoning ingredients for meat, food service, convenience, alternative protein and culinary products.\nHealth & Biosciences\nOur Health & Biosciences segment consists of the development and production of an advanced biotechnology-derived portfolio of enzymes, food cultures, probiotics and specialty ingredients for food and non-food applications. Among many other applications, this biotechnology-driven portfolio includes cultures for use in fermented foods such as yogurt, cheese and fermented beverages, probiotic strains, many with documented clinical health claims for use as dietary supplements and through industrial fermentation the production of enzymes and microorganisms that provide product and process performance benefits to household detergents, animal feed, ethanol production and brewing. Health & Biosciences is comprised of Health, Cultures & Food Enzymes, Home & Personal Care, Animal Nutrition and Grain Processing.\nprovides ingredients for dietary supplements, functional food and beverage, specialized nutrition and pharma.\nCultures & Food Enzymes\nprovides products that aim to serve the global demand for healthy, natural, clean label and fermented food for fresh dairy, cheese, bakery and brewing products. Such products contribute to extended shelf life, stability, taste and texture, helping our customers to improve their product offerings. The business’s enzyme solutions also allow our customers to provide low sugar, high fiber and lactose-free dairy products.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to various rules relating to health, work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate. Our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions, sewage discharges, the use of hazardous materials, waste disposal practices and clean-up of existing environmental contamination. In recent years, there has been an increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards, and the costs of compliance have risen significantly, a trend we expect will continue in the future.\nFor more detailed information about risks related to governmental regulation applicable to the Company, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” –\n“If we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards, including those regarding product safety, quality, efficacy and environmental impact, we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations.”\nThe markets for our products are part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds used in consumer products. Our products are sold principally to manufacturers of dairy, meat, beverages, snacks, savory, sweet, baked goods, grain processors and other foods, personal care products, soaps and detergents, cleaning products, perfumes, dietary supplements, food protection, infant, elderly and animal nutrition, functional food, pharmaceutical and oral care products.\nThe global market for our products has expanded, primarily as a result of an increase in demand for, and an increase in the variety of, consumer products.\nThe market for our products is highly competitive. Our main competitors consist of (1) other large global companies, such as Givaudan, DSM-Firmenich, Symrise, Kerry, ADM, and Novonesis, (2) mid-sized companies, (3) numerous regional and local manufacturers and (4) consumer product companies who may develop their own competing products.\nWe believe that our ability to create products with the sustainability related attributes customers expect and compete successfully in the various sub-market is based on:\nour in-depth understanding of consumers,\nvertical integration,\ninnovation and technological advances from our research and development activities and, as applicable, our scientists,\nour ability to tailor products to customers’ needs,\nour ability to manufacture products on a global scale, and\nbroad-based regulatory capabilities.\nIn certain industries, large multi-national customers and, increasingly, mid-sized customers, may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists,” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products. To compete more successfully, we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs, provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on these “core lists.”\nPrivate label manufacturers, mostly medium-sized, local or small food manufacturers, constitute a growing segment in certain markets where we are active. Over the last decade, with the strengthening of supermarket chains, online platforms and growing consumer price consciousness, consumption of private label products has grown at a faster rate than the brand food industry rate. We believe that new business opportunities will continue to arise from these clients as they are increasing their demand for products that are similar to existing products in the market, distinctive premium products, as well as more innovative products.\nThe success of our business is built on our talented employees. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 22,400 employees worldwide, of whom approximately 24% are employed in the United States. Our workforce plans and talent management programs support our employees to best deliver the business strategy and ensure their development and engagement.\nOur culture is based on our four corporate values of passion, partnership, persistence and principled, and the expression of these values can be seen and felt throughout our history. Our employees appreciate that they contribute to products that touch and enhance the lives of millions of people around the world. Our robust culture ambassador and colleague community program continues to engage a broad portion of the IFF community in building common identity and shared purpose and strengthen engagement and motivation by providing programming on IFF values and providing recognition of individuals who exemplify them.\n\nHome & Personal Care\nproduces enzymes for laundry and dishwashing detergents, cleaning and textiles to help enhance the product and process performance of products in the fabric and home care, textiles and industrials and personal care markets. The business also produces patented enzymatic polymers that are renewable, biodegradable alternatives to functional ingredients used in home cleaning and beauty care products.\nproduces feed enzymes and animal health solutions that help to improve nutrition, welfare, performance and sustainability of livestock animal farming.\nproduces yeasts and enzymes for biofuel production and carbohydrate processing.\nOur Scent segment creates fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and best-known household and personal care products. Consumer insights, science and creativity are at the heart of our Scent business, and, along with our unique portfolio of natural and synthetic ingredients, global footprint, innovative technologies and know-how, and customer intimacy, we believe make us a market leader in scent products. The Scent segment is comprised of Fragrance Compounds and Fragrance Ingredients. We completed the divestiture of our Cosmetic Ingredients business, previously within the Scent segment, on April 2, 2024.\nare unique and proprietary combinations of multiple fragrance ingredients that are ultimately used by our customers in their consumer goods. Our creative and commercial teams within fragrance compounds are organized into two broad categories: fine fragrances and consumer fragrances.\nOur perfumers harness creativity and leverage our innovative captive molecules, sustainable natural ingredients obtained with innovative processes, biotech ingredients, data science, and consumer insights to create unique and inspiring fragrances driving consumer preferences.\nOur fine fragrances focus on perfumes and colognes, creating global and local namesake brands, from high luxury to mass market, from market leading to ultra-niche products.\nOur consumer fragrances include three end-use categories of products:\nFabric Care, including laundry detergents, fabric softeners and specialty laundry products;\nHome Care, including household cleaners, dishwashing detergents and air fresheners; and\nBody Care, including perso",
  "item7_clean": "Pharma Solutions sales in 2024 increased $16 million, or 2% on a reported basis, to $961 million compared to $945 million in 2023. On a currency neutral basis, Pharma Solutions sales also increased 2% in 2024 compared to the 2023 period as the impact of exchange rate variations was flat. Performance in the Pharma Solutions operating segment was driven by volume growth in industrial markets.\nCost of sales decreased $438 million to $7.360 billion (64.1% of sales) in 2024 compared to $7.798 billion (67.9% of sales) in 2023. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily driven by the change in business portfolio mix due to divestitures which was approximately $227 million, lower raw material costs and manufacturing expenses, lower unfavorable manufacturing absorption compared to the prior year period, increased productivity compared to the prior year period, offset in part by volume increases.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses\nR&D expenses increased $35 million to $671 million (5.8% of sales) in 2024 compared to $636 million (5.5% of sales) in 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily driven by an increase in incentive compensation expense, offset in part by the net impact of the change in business portfolio mix due to divestitures and the effect of exchange rate variations.\nSelling and Administrative (S&A) Expenses\nS&A expenses increased $208 million to $1.995 billion (17.4% of sales) in 2024 compared to $1.787 billion (15.6% of sales) in 2023. The increase in S&A expenses was primarily driven by an increase in incentive compensation expense, professional fees, legal fees and provisions incurred for the ongoing investigations of the fragrance businesses, and divestiture related costs incurred in preparation for the sale of the Pharma Solutions disposal group, offset in part by the change in business portfolio mix due to divestitures.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nRestructuring and other charges decreased to $29 million in 2024 compared to $68 million in 2023. The 2024 amounts represent costs primarily related to the IFF Productivity Program and the 2023 amounts represent severance costs primarily incurred as part of the 2023 Restructuring Program. See Note 5 for additional information.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\nAmortization expenses decreased to $610 million in 2024 compared to $680 million in 2023. The decrease in amortization expense was primarily driven by the reduction in intangible assets as a result of the change in business portfolio mix due to divestitures and intangible assets of the Pharma Solutions disposal group being classified as “held for sale,” and therefore no longer recognizing amortization expense on those intangible assets. See Note 4 for additional information.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nThe impairment of goodwill was $64 million in 2024 compared to $2.623 billion in 2023, which was related to the Pharma Solutions disposal group and Nourish reporting units, respectively. See Note 1, Note 4, and Note 12 for additional information.\nInterest expense decreased $75 million to $305 million in 2024 compared to $380 million in 2023. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower debt outstanding. See Note 14 for additional information.\n(Gains) Losses on Business Disposals\n(Gains) losses on business disposals increased to $(346) million in 2024 compared to $23 million in 2023. The net gain on business disposals in 2024 primarily relates to the gain recognized on the sale of the Cosmetic Ingredients business, offset in part by the loss recognized on the sale of the F&E UK business. The loss in 2023 primarily relates to the sale of the FSI business, the sale of a portion of the Savory Solutions business, and liquidation of a business in Russia for the sale of the portion of the Savory Solutions business. See Note 4 for additional information.\nLoss on Assets Classified as Held for Sale\nLoss on assets classified as held for sale was $347 million in 2024. This related to assets classified as held for sale for the Pharma Solutions disposal group and the portion of the Savory Solutions business in Turkey. See Note 4 for additional information.\n\nWe have evaluated and re-prioritized our capital projects and expect that capital spending in 2025 will be approximately 6% of sales.\nCash Flows Used In Financing Activities\nCash flows used in financing activities in 2024 were $1.606 billion compared to $1.851 billion in 2023. The decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from 2023 to 2024 was primarily driven by lower dividends and higher repayments in the prior year period of commercial paper and amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, offset in part by increased repayments of long-term debt.\nWe paid dividends totaling $514 million and $826 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash dividend declared per share in 2024 and 2023 was $1.60 and $3.24, respectively.\nOur capital allocation strategy is primarily focused on debt repayment to maintain our investment grade rating. We will also prioritize capital investment in our businesses to support the strategic long-term plans. We are also committed to maintaining our history of paying a dividend to investors determined by our Board of Directors at its discretion based on various factors.\nOperating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, cash proceeds generated from planned business divestitures and availability under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs, including our debt service requirements, for the foreseeable future. We regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long-term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios. See Note 14 for additional information.\nTerm Loan and Revolving Credit Facility\nOur credit agreements contain various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to credit adjusted EBITDA in respect of the previous 12-month period.\nOur Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to Term SOFR plus an adjustment of 0.10% per annum or, in the case of euro-denominated loans, the Euro interbank offered rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on our public debt rating. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.\nBased on the amendments entered into on September 19, 2023 for our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility, we were provided with a financial covenant relief period through December 31, 2025, or such earlier date on which the Company elects to terminate such period, by providing that during the Term Loan Covenant Relief Period and Revolver Covenant Relief Period, our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio shall not exceed as of the end of the fiscal quarter for the period of the four fiscal quarters then ended: (i) 5.25x for any fiscal quarter ending on or before March 31, 2024, (ii) 4.75x for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024, (iii) 4.50x for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, (iv) 4.25x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before March 31, 2025, (v) 4.00x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before September 30, 2025 and (vi) 3.75x for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2025. During the Term Loan Covenant Relief Period and the Revolver Covenant Relief Period, the amendments prohibit us from (i) effecting share repurchases, (ii) declaring and paying dividends in cash on common stock in excess of $0.81 per share per fiscal quarter (for an aggregate amount of $3.24 per fiscal year) and (iii) creating liens to secure debt in excess of the greater of $300 million and 3.65% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement), in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth therein.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $2 billion Revolving Credit Facility. The amount that we are able to draw down under the Revolving Credit Facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. As of December 31, 2024, our available capacity was $922 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our credit agreements.\nAt December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit agreements, including the net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA\nratio. At December 31, 2024, our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA\nratio was 3.84 to 1.0 as defined by the credit facility agreements, which is below the relevant level provided by our financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. The most comparable GAAP measure is the total debt to net income ratio, which was 37.06 to 1.0 at December 31, 2024.\n_______________________\n\nThe fair value estimates are based on available historical information, future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.\nWe typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates, discount rates and profitability), royalty rates used in the relief of royalty method, customer attrition rates, product obsolescence factors, a brand’s relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nDetermining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires significant judgment. All of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., trademarks, product formulas, non-compete agreements and customer relationships) are expected to have finite useful lives. Our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the regions in which the brands are sold.\nThe costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized through expense over their estimated lives. The value of residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment as described in the following note. For acquired intangible assets, the remaining useful life of the trade names and trademarks, product formulas, and customer relationships was estimated at the point at which substantially all of the present value of cumulative cash flows have been earned.\nThe Periodic Assessment of Potential Impairment of Goodwill and Held for Sale Balances\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have goodwill of approximately $9.080 billion. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of November 30 every year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded.\nWe identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components. Components within a segment that have similar economic characteristics have been aggregated as a single reporting unit. We determined that we have five reporting units under the Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions segments: (1) Nourish, (2) Fragrance Compounds, (3) Fragrance Ingredients, (4) Health & Biosciences and (5) Pharma Solutions. Note that the entire goodwill balance related to Pharma Solutions has been classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024.\nFor the annual impairment test as of November 30, 2024, the Company performed quantitative impairment tests by comparing the fair value of the reporting units with their carrying amounts.\nWe assessed the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach. Under the income approach, we determined the fair value by using a discounted cash flow method at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the projected future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value. We used the most current actual and forecasted operating data available. Key estimates and assumptions used in these valuations include revenue growth rates, gross margins, adjusted operating EBITDA margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates.\nIn performing the quantitative impairment test, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values and determined that there was no further impairment of goodwill in these reporting units as of November 30, 2024. Based on the quantitative impairment test performed, we determined that the Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Fragrance Compounds and Fragrance Ingredients reporting units had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 22%, 18%, 169% and 37%, respectively. While we believe that the assumptions used in the impairment test were reasonable, changes in key assumptions, including lower revenue growth, adjusted operating EBITDA margin, terminal growth rates or increase in discount rates could result in a future impairment. Such impairment could have a material effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets.\nAs discussed in Note 4, the classification of the Pharma Solutions disposal group as held for sale was considered an event or change in circumstance which required an assessment of the existing Pharma Solutions reporting unit. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company performed a pre-classification goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value of the Pharma Solutions reporting unit exceeded the carrying value. Goodwill allocated to the Pharma Solutions reporting unit was $1.2 billion before classification of the disposal group as held for sale. For the pre-classification impairment assessment, we estimated the fair value of the Pharma Solutions reporting unit based upon the fair value of the held for sale disposal group as described below and the estimated fair value of the portion of the Pharma Solutions reporting unit that was not classified as held for sale (“remaining Pharma Solutions reporting unit”).\n\nCredit adjusted EBITDA and net debt, which are non-GAAP measures used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the definition in the debt agreements. In this context, these measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and may not be comparable to credit adjusted EBITDA and net debt used by other companies. Reconciliations of credit adjusted EBITDA to net income and net debt to total debt are as follows:\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nDepreciation and amortization\nCredit Adjusted EBITDA\n_______________________\nSpecified items consisted of restructuring and other charges, impairment of goodwill, acquisition, divestiture and integration costs, strategic initiatives costs, regulatory costs and other costs that are not related to recurring operations.\nNon-cash items consisted of losses (gains) on sale of assets, losses (gains) on b",
