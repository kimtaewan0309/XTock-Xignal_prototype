The decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 is due primarily to a decrease in weighted average outstanding debt. See Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on long-term debt and see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt.\nOther, net was expense of $10 million and income of $93 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily comprised of a net loss related to derivatives of $41 million, partially offset by a foreign currency transaction gain of $23 million primarily related to USD denominated debt held by a foreign subsidiary. Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of a net gain related to derivatives of $87 million, a gain related to debt and equity investments of $55 million, interest and dividend income of $18 million, partially offset by foreign currency transaction loss of $65 million.\nOther, net was expense of $183 million and income of $45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily comprised of a foreign currency transaction loss of $285 million, partially offset by interest and dividend income of $37 million, a net gain related to debt and equity investments of $35 million, and a net gain related to derivatives of $34 million. Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of a interest and dividend income of $62 million and a gain related to debt and equity investments of $11 million, partially offset by a foreign currency transaction loss of $28 million and a net loss related to derivatives of $13 million.\nOur effective income tax rate was a benefit of 5.9% on loss before income taxes and a provision of 23.7% on income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to a provision of 17.7% and 9.3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate for each of the periods was favorably impacted primarily by the mix of U.S. and foreign incomes including Macau gaming profits which are exempt from complementary tax. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was unfavorably impacted by the non-tax deductible Empire City goodwill impairment recorded during the current quarter. The effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also favorably impacted by a decrease in the valuation allowance for Macau deferred tax assets.\nReportable Segment GAAP measure\n“Segment Adjusted EBITDAR” is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, triple net lease rent expense, income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates, goodwill impairment, and also excludes corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment. Triple net lease rent expense is the expense for rent to landlords under triple net operating leases for its domestic properties, the ground subleases of Beau Rivage and MGM National Harbor, and the land concessions at MGM China. “Segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin” is Segment Adjusted EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues.\n“Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, and goodwill impairment.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA information is a non-GAAP measure that is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because it is among the measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance, and because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a measure of operating performance in the gaming industry and as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our properties, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. However, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be construed as an alternative or substitute to any measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For example, we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, while we believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure of performance, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to or substitute for operating income or net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to or substitute for cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may calculate Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is included herein.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to MGM Resorts International to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nOperating income (loss)\nNet income (loss) attributable to MGM Resorts International\nConsolidated net revenues increased 2% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to MGM China increasing 17% and MGM Digital increasing 23%, partially offset by Las Vegas Strip Resorts decreasing 7%, and Regional Operations flat, each as compared to the prior year quarter and as discussed below.\nConsolidated operating loss was $113 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to operating income of $315 million in the prior year quarter.
