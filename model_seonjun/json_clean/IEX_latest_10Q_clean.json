The financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\nIDEX is an applied solutions provider specializing in the manufacturing of health and science technologies, fluid and metering technologies, and fire, safety and other diversified products built to customers’ specifications. IDEX’s products are sold in niche markets across a wide range of industries throughout the world. Accordingly, IDEX’s businesses are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic conditions in the U.S. and in other countries where it does business, as well as by the relationship of the U.S. dollar to other currencies. Levels of capacity utilization and capital spending in certain markets and overall industrial activity are important factors that influence the demand for IDEX’s products.\n(All comparisons are against the same period in 2024 unless otherwise noted)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025\nRecord reported Net sales of $878.7 million increased 10% overall and increased 5% organically*\nReported diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) attributable to IDEX of $1.70 increased 8%\nAdjusted diluted EPS attributable to IDEX* of $2.03 increased 7%\n*These are non-GAAP measures. See the definitions of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures under the heading “Non-GAAP Disclosures.”\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, the Company delivered strong operating performance driven by strong price/cost execution and net productivity improvements, including platform optimization savings resulting from restructuring and other cost containment actions taken during 2025, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. Operating results during the quarter also benefited from the acquisition of Mott Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Mott”).\nRegardless of the business environment, IDEX’s business model and 8020 discipline position the Company to quickly address challenges and pursue opportunities as they arise. Overall industrial order trends remain range-bound and the Company continues to see hesitation around larger order commitments from many customers. Given geopolitical, trade, and overall macroeconomic uncertainty, IDEX remains focused on what it can control and driving sustainable growth and value creation for all stakeholders. The Company continues to refine its capabilities through platform-building, capability-tuning, and integrated growth strategies that customers value. However, IDEX cannot be certain these strategies will entirely mitigate macroeconomic shifts, including if demand otherwise decreases. The Company remains focused on optimizing its business portfolio and expects its strong cash generation and balance sheet will continue to enable opportunistic capital deployment to generate shareholder value sustainably in the long run.\n\nNet sales for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased as compared to the same prior year periods as a result of contributions from the acquisition of Mott. Organic sales for the same periods increased 5% and 1%, respectively driven by positive price across all segments. While higher volumes in our Health & Science Technologies and Fluid & Metering Technologies segments more than offset the lower volumes in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment during the three months ended September 30, 2025, higher volumes in our Health & Science Technologies segment only partly mitigated lower volumes in our Fluid & Metering Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segments during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit and Gross margin for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were positively impacted by operational productivity improvements and price cost but were negatively impacted by unfavorable mix. The nine months ended September 30, 2025 was also negatively impacted by volume deleverage. Gross profit for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was positively impacted by acquisitions, net of divestitures, while Gross margin for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was negatively impacted by acquisitions, net of divestitures. Platform optimization savings resulting from restructuring actions taken during 2025 mitigated increases in other employee-related costs during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased by $14.2 million and $47.7 million from acquisitions, net of divestitures, including amortization, respectively, as well as increased professional services spending and slightly higher employee-related costs, driven by variable compensation, as compared to the same prior year periods.\n\nRestructuring Expenses and Asset Impairments\nRestructuring expenses and asset impairments primarily relate to severance expense for restructuring actions taken during the respective periods presented. Severance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were incurred in conjunction with organizational changes, primarily designed to connect scalable groups of businesses, which resulted in a reduction of headcount. Additionally, the Company eliminated certain management layers in select areas. For additional information regarding restructuring expenses and asset impairments, refer to\n, “Restructuring Expenses and Asset Impairments,” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGain on Sale of Business\nOn June 3, 2024, the Company completed the sale of Alfa Valvole, Srl (“Alfa Valvole”) for proceeds of $45.1 million, net of cash remitted, resulting in an initial gain on the sale of $4.6 million, net of a release of cumulative foreign currency translation losses of $5.5 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the gain on the sale of Alfa Valvole was finalized, resulting in a downward adjustment to the gain on sale of $0.6 million for a final gain on sale of $4.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. For additional information regarding the divestiture of Alfa Valvole, refer to\n, “Acquisitions and Divestitures,” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther (Income) Expense – Net\nOther (income) expense – net during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 reflects the impact of foreign currency transactions.\nInterest Expense – Net\nInterest expense – net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased primarily due to the impact of higher debt outstanding used to finance the acquisition of Mott as well as lower interest income earned as compared to the prior year periods.\nThe effective tax rate was 25.1% and 23.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as compared to 22.9% and 21.9% during the same periods in 2024, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 reflects the impact of the current period enactment of the OBBBA. The enacted tax legislation had an unfavorable impact on the foreign derived intangible income deduction primarily due to the recovery of previously capitalized unamortized research expenditures. For additional information, refer to\n, “Income Taxes”, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn October 2021, members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agreed to a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges associated with the digitalization of the economy. In December 2021, the OECD released the Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), which define the global minimum tax and call for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing draft legislation to implement the minimum tax directive. Many aspects of Pillar Two became effective January 1, 2025; however, nearly all of the jurisdictions in which IDEX operates have an effective tax rate above the 15% threshold. Therefore, the Company does not expect a material impact from the Pillar Two income tax rules. We are continuing to monitor legislative developments and evaluate financial results for changes in the expected impact.\n\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of unallocated corporate costs of $21.7 million and $73.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively.\nHealth & Science Technologies Segment\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nComponents of Change\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nComponents of Change\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\nAcquisitions include Mott, acquired in September 2024 and Micro-LAM, Inc. (“Micro-LAM”) acquired in July 2025.\nOrganic sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 reflect positive price and favorable volumes driven by timing of progress made on large orders at"
