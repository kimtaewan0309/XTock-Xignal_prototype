Our generating capacity includes primarily nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric assets. Through our integrated business operations, we sell electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related products and sustainable solutions to various types of customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, public sector, and residential customers in markets across multiple geographic regions. We have five reportable segments: Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and Other Power Regions.\nSignificant Transactions and Developments\nConowingo Hydroelectric Project License Renewal\nIn September 2025, we reached a settlement agreement with MDE, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association, and Waterkeepers Chesapeake, that resolves all outstanding issues related to obtaining a water quality certification from MDE. As a result, MDE issued a water quality certification, clearing the way for the re-licensing and continued operation of our Conowingo hydroelectric facility. The terms of the agreement include operational improvements and commitments for water quality and resiliency, trash and debris removal, aquatic life passage, freshwater mussel restoration, dredging and invasive species management. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters for more information.\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\nWe continue to see legislative support for nuclear energy generation, including the passage of the OBBBA. Signed into law in July 2025, the OBBBA both preserves certain federal tax credits from the IRA and enhances certain credits to allow advanced nuclear facilities to qualify for the energy communities bonus adder, subject to\neligibility requirements. Overall, the OBBBA reinforces the long-term economic viability of our nuclear generation assets. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters for more information.\nClinton Clean Energy Center\nIn June 2025, we signed a 20-year PPA with Meta Platforms, Inc. (Meta) for the output of the Clinton Clean Energy Center to support Meta’s clean energy goals and operations in the region with emissions-free nuclear energy. The agreement, beginning in June 2027, supports the relicensing and continued operations of Clinton for another two decades after the state’s ZEC program expires. This deal will expand Clinton’s clean energy output by 30 megawatts through plant uprates, expected to be fully complete in 2029, and will enable the Clinton Clean Energy Center to continue to flow power onto the local grid, providing grid reliability and low-cost power to the region for decades to come. The uprates are expected to qualify for the technology-neutral clean electricity PTC (45Y) provided for by the IRA and preserved by the OBBBA for its first 10 years of operations.\nProposed Acquisition of Calpine Corporation\nOn January 10, 2025, we entered an agreement and plan of merger (Merger Agreement) with Calpine Corporation (Calpine) under which we will acquire all the outstanding equity interests of Calpine in a cash and stock transaction. Calpine owns and operates a generation fleet of natural gas, geothermal, battery storage, and solar assets with over 27 GWs of generation capacity, in addition to a competitive retail electric supplier platform with 60 TWhs of load annually.\nThis acquisition is complementary to, and aligns strategically with, our existing business operations and provides both increased scale and meaningful market diversification. We will couple the largest producer of clean, carbon-free energy with the reliable, dispatchable natural gas assets of Calpine, and also create the nation’s leading competitive retail electric supplier, providing increased scale, diversification and complementary capabilities that will enable us to meet growing demand with a broader array of energy and sustainability products. The addition of Calpine will strengthen our essential role in providing clean, reliable, and affordable energy as the nation seeks to transition to a more sustainable future, and will better position us to pursue investments in new and existing technologies to meet growing demand.\nWe received regulatory approvals for the merger from the PUCT and NYPSC in June 2025 and from the FERC in July 2025. Completion of the transaction is subject to the expiration or termination of any agreement with the DOJ to delay the consummation of the transaction and other customary closing conditions. See Note 2 — Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Key Business Drivers\nThe energy sector has been impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign trade policies, particularly the introduction and adjustment of tariffs by the U.S. on the import of various energy-related products and materials. Importantly, oil, natural gas, and uranium (including enriched uranium) are currently excluded from most of the recent tariff changes. The imposition of tariffs on imported goods, including electric transformers and other equipment used for power generation, may lead to increased costs for acquiring essential components to maintain, uprate, and operate our generating facilities. We are committed to navigating the current environment through prudent cost management, utilization of supplier relationships, and potential supply alternatives as mitigants for potential price increases. The long-term impact of tariffs on the energy sector remains uncertain and we cannot predict or estimate the impact on future consolidated financial statements.\nRussia and Ukraine Conflict\nWe are closely monitoring developments of the ongoing Russia and Ukraine conflict, including United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Canadian sanctions, and legislation that may impact exports and imports of Russian nuclear fuel supply and enrichment activities, as well as the potential for Russia to limit fuel deliveries. The U.S. “Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act” became effective in August 2024, banning the import of low-enriched uranium into the U.S. that is produced in Russia or by Russian entities, absent a waiver from the DOE. Under a corollary bill, the Department of Energy has begun the process of distributing billions of dollars to\nsupport expansion of the domestic nuclear fuel cycle within the United States to improve carbon-free energy security. In November 2024, the Russian government issued a decree imposing temporary restrictions on the export of enriched uranium from Russia to the U.S. but allowing for a special Russian export license to be issued for individual shipments. Our nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium supply and service contracts. We work with a diverse set of domestic and international suppliers years in advance to procure our nuclear fuel to support our refueling needs and mitigate the risk of exposure to Russian nuclear fuel supply. Recognizing the potential for the continuing conflict to impact our longer-term security and cost of supply, we have entered into contracts to increase the size of our nuclear fuel inventory. Our fuel procurement activities comply with all U.S. and international trade laws and we continue to take advantage of all available avenues to maintain continuity in our nuclear fuel supply, including working with the U.S. Government and our diverse set of suppliers to secure the nuclear fuel needed to continue to operate our nuclear fleet long-term.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nRegulation of GHGs from Power Plants under the Clean Air Act.\nIn April 2024, EPA issued a final rule that regulates greenhouse gases from existing coal, new natural gas-fired power plants, and existing oil/gas steam generators under Clean Air Act section 111. The applicable standards are subcategorized by retirement date for existing coal and capacity factor for new gas. In June 2025, EPA issued a proposal to repeal its regulations addressing GHG emissions from the sector. In July 2025, EPA issued a proposed rule to repeal the 2009 \"Endangerment Finding\" underpinning all GHG regulation by EPA. Repealing the finding would provide an independent basis for ending EPA regulation of GHGs from power plants.\nIn June 2023, EPA published a final rule called “Federal 'Good Neighbor Plan' for the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards” also known as the \"Transport Rule\". The rule, among other things, establishes nitrogen oxides emissions budgets requiring fossil fuel-fired power plants in 23 states to participate in an allowance-based ozone season trading program beginning in 2023. In February 2023, EPA disapproved state implementation plans submitted by 21 states for failure to address their obligations under the \"good neighbor\" provisions of the Clean Air Act. However, several Regional Courts of Appeals issued orders staying, pending judicial review, EPA's disapproval of several state plans (including Texas). In June 2024, the Supreme Court stayed EPA's rule for the duration of the litigation. In November 2024, EPA issued an administrative stay of the rule. EPA has announced its intent to approve state plans that would replace the Good Neighbor Plan.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFinancial Results of Operations\nGAAP Results of Operations.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.
