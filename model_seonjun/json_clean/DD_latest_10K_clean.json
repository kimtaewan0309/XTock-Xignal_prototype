The new assets were online and operational in early 2024 and the total investment was approximately $400 million.\nCORPORATE & OTHER\nCorporate & Other includes sales and activity of the Retained Businesses including the Auto Adhesives & Fluids, Multibase\nTM\nand Tedlar® product lines. Corporate & Other includes DuPont's equity interest in Derby Holdings Group related to the Delrin® Divestiture. The results of Corporate & Other also include the sales and activity of certain divested businesses including the operations of the Biomaterials business unit divested in May 2022. Corporate & Other also includes certain enterprise and governance activities including non-allocated corporate overhead costs and support functions, leveraged services, non-business aligned litigation expenses and other costs not absorbed by reportable segments.\nThe costs of the M&M Businesses that are classified as discontinued operations include only direct operating expenses incurred prior to the M&M Divestiture on November 1, 2022 and costs which the Company stopped incurring upon the close of the Delrin® Divestiture. Indirect costs, such as those related to corporate and shared service functions previously allocated to the M&M Businesses, do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations and remain reported within continuing operations. A portion of these indirect costs related to activities the Company continues to undertake post-closing of the M&M Divestitures, and for which it is reimbursed (“Future Reimbursable Indirect Costs”). Future Reimbursable Indirect Costs are reported within continuing operations in Corporate & Other but are excluded from Operating EBITDA as defined below. The remaining portion of these indirect costs are not subject to future reimbursement (“Stranded Costs”). Stranded Costs are reported within continuing operations in Corporate & Other and are included within Operating EBITDA.\nThe Company's measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is Operating EBITDA as this is the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") assesses performance and allocates resources. The Company defines Operating EBITDA as earnings (i.e., “Income from continuing operations before income taxes\") before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating pension / other post-employment benefits (“OPEB”) / charges, and foreign exchange gains / losses, excluding Future Reimbursable Indirect Costs, and adjusted for significant items.\nINDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION RESULTS\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by business or major product line.\nSales by geographic region are included within Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\", \"Results of Operations.\" See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding total net sales and total assets by segment, as well as net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region.\nSIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND COMPETITION\nIn 2024, no significant portion of the Company's sales was dependent upon a single customer. The markets in which the Company participates compete primarily through technology, range of products and services, performance, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, service and support. The Company provides extensive support, technical services and testing services for its customers, in addition to new product development. The Company believes that its proprietary product and process technologies, robust product and application development pipelines, customer intimacy, global manufacturing capability and local service capability enable it to compete successfully.\nDuPont is a multi-industrial company and is subject to competition across all product and service areas. Key competitors include but are not limited to:\nElectronics & Industrial:\nElement Solutions, Entegris, Fujifilm, Henkel, JSR, Merck KGaA, MKS Instruments, and Resonac.\n3M, Honeywell, Hydranautics, Kingspan, Kolon, Lanxess, Owens-Corning, Ecolab, Avient, Toray, Teijin, and Yantai.\nAgainst this competitive backdrop, value-in-use is the primary driver of price for the Company’s products, although price is impacted by many factors including, among others, fluctuations in supply and demand, and availability and cost of key manufacturing inputs including raw materials and energy.\nSOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MAJOR RAW MATERIALS\nThe Company uses a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacturing of products. The prices of raw materials are driven by global supply and demand. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures. The Company actively works to mitigate impacts of such conditions.\nDISTRIBUTION\nMost products are marketed primarily through the Company's sales organization, although for some product lines, more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors. The Company has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the Company's brands to customers globally. This network consists of the Company's sales and marketing organization partnering with distributors, independent retailers, cooperatives and agents throughout the world.\nBACKLOG\nIn general, the Company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are typically based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. However, from time to time in limited instances the Company does operate against a backlog for certain products, which has in the past resulted, and in the future may result, from the availability of raw materials from third-party suppliers. Therefore, the Company believes that backlog information is generally not meaningful to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.\nSEASONALITY\nCertain of the Company's sales are seasonal as consumer electronics and North American and European construction end-market demand generally increases in the second and third fiscal quarters resulting in sales increases in Interconnect Solutions and Shelter Solutions, respectively. This seasonality is partially mitigated by the other products provided by the Company that have no material seasonal effect.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThe Company’s businesses differentially manage their respective intellectual property estates to support Company strategic priorities, which can include leveraging intellectual property within and across product lines.\nTrade secrets are an important part of the Company's intellectual property. Many of the processes used to make products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties. DuPont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets. When the Company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, the Company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the Company and/or unjust enrichment.\nThe Company applies for and obtains patents in many countries, including the U.S., and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed. DuPont’s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company in the aggregate. The Company considers various intellectual property protections and strategic business priorities when deciding whether to apply for or maintain a patent.\nThe protection afforded by patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country and type of patent protection. The term of these patents is approximately twenty years from the filing date in general, but varies depending on country and type of patent protection. DuPont's significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the Company’s strategic priorities within and across product lines. At December 31, 2024, the Company owned about 12,800 patents and patent applications globally. Approximately 80 percent of the Company’s patent estate has a remaining term of more than 5 years.\nThe Company owns or licenses many trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer retail level and/or the product line to product line level. Ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected.\nENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY MATTERS\nDuPont operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. For more information see: (1) Environmental Proceedings on page\n, (2) Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page\n, (3) Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nDuPont’s purpose is to empower the world with the essential innovations to thrive. The Company operates within four core values of protecting safety and health; respect for people; conduct in accordance with the highest ethical behavior; and protecting the planet. DuPont’s sustainability strategy is focused on driving innovations to create sustainable solutions that help address the most pressing challenges facing society and the planet; enhancing the sustainability of its operations and facilities; and protecting the health and well-being of its employees and communities. DuPont believes that climate change is an important global environmental issue that presents risks and opportunities. The Company is continuously evaluating opportunities for existing and new product and serv",
  "item7_clean": "2025 OUTLOOK\nFor the full year 2025, the Company anticipates ongoing strength within semiconductor markets as well as more normalized sales patterns in China. Continued growth is expected in the markets served by Interconnect Solutions driven by improved consumer electronics demand and refresh cycles for devices in support of AI adoption. Within the healthcare markets, the Company anticipates growth acceleration in demand for medical devices along with continued demand stabilization for medical packaging applications and biopharma markets. In the markets served by Water, the Company expects increased demand to drive year over year volume growth. The Company anticipates stable demand within the markets served by the Company’s other industrial-based product lines.\nLIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company continually reviews its sources of liquidity and debt portfolio and may make adjustments to one or both to ensure adequate liquidity and increase the Company’s optionality and financing efficiency as it relates to financing cost and balancing terms/maturities. The Company’s primary source of incremental liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. Management expects the generation of cash from operations and the ability to access the debt capital markets and other sources of liquidity will continue to provide sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet the Company’s and its subsidiaries' obligations as they come due. However, DuPont is unable to predict the extent of macroeconomic related impacts which depend on uncertain and unpredictable future developments. In light of this uncertainty, the Company has taken steps to further ensure liquidity and capital resources, as discussed below.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $1.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023 were held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The Company held no investments in marketable securities at December 31, 2024 and\n. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was due to cash used in the current year to fund the Q1 2024 ASR Transaction, the Donatelle Acquisition, partial redemption of 2038 Notes and general corporate purposes. Refer to subsequent paragraphs for further discussion of the drivers of the change in cash and cash equivalents.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2024 and\nwas $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the partial redemption of $650 million of 2038 Notes discussed below.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company is contractually obligated to make future cash payments of $7.3 billion and $4.0 billion associated with principal and interest, respectively, on debt obligations. Related to the principal, $1.9 billion will be due in the next twelve months and the remainder will be due subsequent to 2025. The Company may address the maturity with cash on hand, issuance of commercial paper, utilizing existing credit facilities, accessing the debt capital markets or a combination of any of them. Related to interest, $359 million will be due in the next twelve months and the remainder will be due subsequent to 2025. The majority of interest obligations will be due in 2030 or later.\nIn relation to the Company’s fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements, there is a mandatory early termination date of December 15, 2025. The mark-to-market value on these swaps at December 31, 2024 is $116 million. The final settlement amount will depend on movements in interest rates. Refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Company’s interest rate swap agreements.\nCapital Structure Actions\nIn connection with the Previously Intended Business Separations, on June 5, 2024, DuPont issued a notice of redemption to the bond trustee with respect to a partial redemption of $650 million aggregate principal amount of its 2038 Notes, in accordance with their terms. The partial redemption occurred on June 15, 2024, at the redemption price set forth in the indenture of the 2038 Notes. The Company funded the repayment with cash on hand. As a result of the early redemption of the debt, for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred a loss of approximately $74 million, which consisted of the redemption premium, write-off of the deferred debt issuance costs and the basis adjustment from fair value hedge accounting on the 2022 Swaps associated with this borrowing. See Note 21 for further detail on the 2022 Swaps.\nIn connection with the Previously Intended Business Separations and continuing in light of the Intended Electronics Separation, DuPont is considering potentially repaying, redeeming, repurchasing, or exchanging some or all of its other senior notes, which could include redemptions, tender offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other transactions or a combination of any of them, which will be on pricing terms that are determined at the time of any such transaction. Such transactions will depend on liquidity considerations, contractual and legal restrictions, prevailing market conditions and other factors.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nThe Company has entered a $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility in the second quarter of each calendar year beginning in 2022. In July 2022, the Company drew down $600 million under its 2022 $1 billion revolving credit facility in order to facilitate certain intercompany internal restructuring steps related to the M&M Divestiture. The Company repaid the borrowing in September 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's credit facilities:\nCommitted and Available Credit Facilities at December 31, 2024\nFive-Year Revolving Credit Facility\n2024 $1B Revolving Credit Facility\nTotal Committed and Available Credit Facilities\nThe Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility is generally expected to remain undrawn and serve as a backstop to the Company’s commercial paper and letter of credit issuance.\nThe 2024 $1B Revolving Credit Facility is available to be used for general corporate purposes. There were no drawdowns under the facility during the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company intends to enter into a new revolving credit facility in the second quarter 2025.\nRepayment of Senior Notes\nIn November 2022, the Company redeemed in full $2.5 billion of the 2023 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the aggregated principal amount plus the accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption was funded with the net proceeds from the M&M Divestiture.\nIn November 2023, the $300 million Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes matured and was repaid at par plus the accrued and unpaid interest. The Company funded the repayment with cash on hand.\nTerminated Intended Rogers Acquisition\nIn connection with the Terminated Intended Rogers Acquisition, on November 22, 2021, the Company entered into a two-year senior unsecured committed term loan agreement in the amount of $5.2 billion. In October 2022, the facility was amended to extend the lending commitment (as amended the \"Amended 2021 Term Loan Facility\"). On November 1, 2022, the M&M Divestiture closed and, therefore, based on the terms of the Amended 2021 Term Loan Facility, the commitment was terminated. Separately, on November 1, 2022 the Company announced the termination of the previously announced agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of Rogers. The Company paid Rogers a termination fee of $162.5 million in accordance with the agreement on November 2, 2022. The termination fee was paid with cash on hand and recorded in the \"Acquisition, integration and separation costs\" within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nIn April 2022, DuPont downsized its authorized commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $2.5 billion (the “DuPont Commercial Paper Program”). At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no issuances outstanding of commercial paper.\nDonatelle Plastics Acquisition\nOn July 28, 2024, DuPont completed the acquisition of Donatelle Plastics, LLC for a net purchase price of $365 million, which includes the estimated fair value for a contingent earn-out liability of $40 million. The Company utilized existing cash balances to complete the acquisition.\nSpectrum Acquisition\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company completed the Spectrum Acquisition for a net purchase price of approximately $1,781 million, including a net upward adjustment of approximately $43 million for acquired cash and net working capital, among other items. The Company utilized existing cash balances to complete the acquisition.\nWater District Settlement Agreement\nThe Company utilized the MOU escrow account balance of approximately $100 million and cash on hand to make its $400 million contribution to the Water District Settlement Fund. The judgment became final in April 2024, therefore the $400 million contribution, plus interest, to the Water District Settlement Fund is reflected as a cash outflow within cash flows from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn November 1, 2023, the Company closed the sale of the Delrin® business to TJC LP (\"TJC\"), (the “Delrin® Divestiture”). DuPont received cash proceeds of approximately $1.28 billion, which includes certain customary transaction adjustments, a note receivable of $350 million and acquired a 19.9 percent non-controlling equity interest in Derby Group Holdings LLC, (“Derby”). The customary transaction adjustments include $27 million of cash transferred with the Delrin® Divestiture for which DuPont was reimbursed at closing resulting in net cash proceeds of $1.25 billion. TJC, through its subsidiaries, holds the 80.1 percent controlling interest in Derby. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. The Company remains committed to maintaining a strong financial position with a balanced financial policy focused on maintaining a strong investment-grade rating and driving shareholder value and remuneration. At January 31, 2024, DuPont's credit ratings were as follows:\nBBB+\nA-2\nMoody’s Investors Service\nP-2\nBBB+\nF-2\nThe Company's indenture covenants include customary limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and mergers and consolidations, subject to certain limitations. The senior unsecured notes (the \"2018 Senior Notes\") also contain customary default provisions. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility and 2024 $1B Revolving Credit Facility contain a financial covenant, typical for companies with similar credit ratings, requiring that the ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.60. At December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with this financial covenant.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table.\n(In millions) For the years ended December 31,\nCash provided by (used for) from continuing operations:\nOperating activities\nInvesting activities\nFinancing activities\nCash used for discontinued operations\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nCash Flows provided by Operating Activities - Continuing Operations\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $2,321 million, $2,191 million and $1,249 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily from higher earnings the net impact from changes in variable compensation payouts and accruals partially offset by an increase in cash used by net working capital. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2023 compared with 2022\nprimarily from improvements in working capital.\nThe table below reflects net working capital on a continuing operations basis:\nIn millions (except ratio)\nNet working capital has been presented to exclude the assets and liabilities related to the Delrin® Divestiture. The assets and liabilities related to the Delrin® Divestiture are presented as assets of discontinued operations and liabilities of discontinued operations, respectively.\nCash Flows used in/ provided by Investing Activities - Continuing Operations\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations in 2024 was $849 million compared to cash provided by investing activities of $172 million and $9,004 million in 2023 and\n. The change in investing activities in 2024 versus the 2023 is primarily attributable to the absence of proceeds received from sales and maturity of investments and proceeds from sales of property and business partially offset by the impact of the change in cash paid for acquisition in each year.\nThe decrease in cash provided from investing activities in 2023 versus the 2022 is primarily attributable to the absence of cash proceeds received from the M&M Divestiture and cash paid for the Spectrum acquisition, partially offset by proceeds from the Delrin® Divestiture, net of cash divested and the absence of cash used in the purchase of investments and an increase in cash provided by the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments that was previously invested and reflected as a cash outflow in 2022. Cash provided by investing activities in 2022 is primarily attributable to the cash proceeds received from the M&M Divestiture partially offset by purchases of investments.\nCapital expenditures totaled $579 million, $619 million and $662 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company\nexpects 2025 capital expenditures to be about $660 million which includes separation-related capital expenditures. The Company may adjust its spending throughout the year as economic conditions develop.\nCash Flows used for Financing Activities - Continuing Operations\nCash used for financing activities of continuing operations in 2024 was $1,847 million compared to cash used for financing activities of $2,989 million and $7,646 million in 2023 and\n. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2024 versus the 2023 is primarily attributable to the decrease in share buyback activities partially offset by the partial redemption of the 2038 Notes. The decrease in 2023 versus the 2022 is primarily attributable to the decrease in share buyback activities and decrease in the payment of long-term debt. Cash used for financing activities in 2022 primarily driven by the share buyback activities and the redemption of 2023 Notes.\nCash Flows used for Discontinued Operations\nCash used for discontinued operations was $474 million compared with $306 million in the same period last year. The cash used from discontinued operations includes MOU activity, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The activity for the year ended December 31, 2023, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present the cash flows of Delrin® as discontinued operations. The activity for the year ended December 31, 2022, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows present the financial results of the M&M Businesses as discontinued operations.\nThe following table provides dividends paid to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nDividends paid, per common share\nDividends paid to common stockholders\nShare Buyb",
