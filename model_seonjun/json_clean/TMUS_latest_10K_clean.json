Our customers benefit from what we believe is an unmatched combination of value and network quality, unwavering focus on offering them the best possible service experience and undisputable drive for disruptive innovation in wireless and beyond. This includes providing added value and what we believe is an exceptional experience while implementing signature Un-carrier initiatives that have changed the wireless industry. We ended annual service contracts, overages, unpredictable international roaming fees and data buckets, among other things. We are inspired by a relentless focus on customer experience, consistently delivering award-winning customer experience, which drives our customer satisfaction levels while enabling operational efficiencies.\nWith what we believe is America’s largest, fastest, most awarded and most advanced 5G network, the Un-carrier strives to offer customers unrivaled coverage and capacity where they live, work and travel. We believe our network is the foundation of our success and powers everything we do. Our dense and multi-layer network provides an unmatched 5G and overall network experience to our customers, which consists of our foundational layer of low-band, our mid-band and our millimeter-wave (“mmWave”) spectrum licenses (see “Spectrum Position” below). This multilayer portfolio of spectrum broadens and deepens our nationwide 5G network, enabling accelerated innovation and increased competition in the U.S. wireless and broadband industries.\nWe continue to expand the footprint and improve the quality of our network, enabling us to provide what we believe are outstanding wireless experiences for customers who should not have to compromise on quality and value. Our network allows us to deliver new, innovative products and services, such as our High Speed Internet fixed wireless product, with the same customer experience focus and industry-disrupting mindset that we have adopted in our attempt to redefine the wireless communications services industry in the United States in the customers’ favor.\nAs part of our relentless, customer-first focus, we are transforming into an AI-enabled, data-informed, digital-first organization to continue delivering differentiated experiences to our customers. Leveraging the latest AI technology and digital capabilities, we are pioneering new approaches to serving customers with a platform to better anticipate and proactively solve their issues, offering personalized self-service options and taking authorized actions on their behalf, while simultaneously creating large-format customer experience stores for customers looking for an immersive experience, and increasing investment in domestic customer care. Our comprehensive T-Life app will further allow us to tap into customer preferences and radically simplify customer experiences in the future.\nItem 7.

We also offer for sale to customers a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets, home broadband routers and other mobile communication devices that are manufactured by various suppliers.\nOur most popular service plan offering is Go5G Plus, which includes unlimited talk, text and data on our network, 5G access at no extra cost, scam protection features, access to the same device offers as new customers and more. We also offer an Essentials rate plan for customers who want the basics at a lower price point, specific rate plans to qualifying customers, including Military and Veterans, First Responder and 55+, as well as Go5G and Go5G Next plans to deliver a full suite of plans that provide customers the features that meet their lifestyle and daily needs.\nAt the time of device purchase, qualified customers can finance all or a portion of the individual device or accessory purchase price over an installment period, generally of 24 months, using an equipment installment plan (“EIP”).\nIn addition to our wireless communications services, we offer High Speed Internet, which includes a fixed wireless product that utilizes the excess capacity of our nationwide 5G network. Our fixed wireless product is available to tens of millions of domestic households where we currently have excess network capacity, providing, for some consumers, an alternative to traditional landline internet or broadband service providers and expanding access to and choice for some consumers. With our High Speed Internet plan, customers can access the internet without worrying about annual service contracts, data overages or hidden fees.\nWe also provide products and services that are complementary to our wireless communications services, including device protection, financial services and advertising.\nWe provide wireless communications services to a variety of customers needing connectivity, but focus primarily on two categories of customers:\nPostpaid customers generally are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communications services utilizing phones, High Speed Internet modems, mobile internet devices (including tablets and hotspots), wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices (including SyncUP and internet of things (“IoT”)). We serve consumers as well as business customers, who are provided services under the T-Mobile for Business brand.\nPrepaid customers generally pay for wireless communications services in advance. We serve prepaid customers under the T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile brands.\nWe provide Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) customers access to our network. This access and the customer relationship are managed by wholesale partners, with whom we have commercial agreements permitting them to sell services utilizing our network.\nWe generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communications services to postpaid and prepaid customers. Our ability to attract and retain postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2024, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communications services by customer category were:\n79% Postpaid customers;\n16% Prepaid customers; and\n5% Wholesale and other services.\nSubstantially all of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were earned in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nUtilizing our multilayer spectrum portfolio, our mission is to become “Famous for Network.” We have deployed low-band, mid-band and mmWave spectrum dedicated for 5G across our dense and broad network to create what we believe is America’s largest, fastest, most awarded and most advanced 5G network.\nWe believe our spectrum position and focus on technology leadership will continue to drive network differentiation. Our innovative Customer-Driven Coverage (“CDC”) approach to network investments, and leadership in deploying the latest network technologies including Massive Multiple-input/multiple-out (“Massive MIMO”), Voice over New Radio (“VoNR”), four-carrier and higher order aggregation, dynamic network slicing and the U.S.’s first broad deployment of 5G Advanced, are\nenabled by our scaled nationwide 5G standalone network. We are also part of an alliance working to bring Radio Access Network (“RAN”) and AI innovation closer together to deliver transformational network experiences in the future.\nWe provide wireless communications services utilizing low-band spectrum licenses covering our 600 MHz and 700 MHz spectrum, mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”), Personal Communications Services (“PCS”) and 2.5 GHz spectrum, and mmWave spectrum.\nWe controlled an average of 394 MHz of combined low- and mid-band spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2024. This spectrum is comprised of:\nAn average of 41 MHz in the 600 MHz band;\nAn average of 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band;\nAn average of 14 MHz in the 800 MHz band;\nAn average of 41 MHz in the 1700 MHz AWS band;\nAn average of 66 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band;\nAn average of 184 MHz in the 2.5 GHz band;\nAn average of 11 MHz in the 3.45 GHz band; and\nAn average of 27 MHz in the C-band.\nWe controlled an average of 1,033 GHz of combined mmWave spectrum licenses.\nIn September 2023, we entered into a License Purchase Agreement with Comcast Corporation and its affiliate, Comcast OTR1, LLC (together with Comcast Corporation, “Comcast”) pursuant to which we will acquire spectrum in the 600 MHz band in exchange for total cash consideration of between $1.2 billion and $3.3 billion. On January 13, 2025, we and Comcast entered into an amendment to the License Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we will acquire additional spectrum. Subsequent to the amendment, the total cash consideration for the transaction is between $1.2 billion and $3.4 billion. See\n– Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets\nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nWe plan to evaluate future spectrum purchases in future auctions and secondary market opportunities to further augment or refine our current spectrum position.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had equipment deployed on approximately 82,000 macro cell sites and 52,000 small cell/distributed antenna system sites across our network.\nThe wireless communications services industry remains competitive.

In addition to our wireless communications services, our High Speed Internet service competes against other broadband providers, including traditional wireline solutions, such as Cable, DSL and Fiber broadband providers, and fixed wireless solutions, including AT&T and Verizon’s fixed wireless products, and Satellite Internet providers. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services and broadband industries include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies and regulatory changes. Some of our competitors have shown a willingness to use discounted pricing or offer bundled services as a potential source of differentiation.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 70,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.\nAttraction and Retention\nWe employ a highly skilled workforce within a broad range of functions. Substantially all of our employees are located throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico, to serve our nationwide network and retail operations. Our headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington, and Overland Park, Kansas.\nWe attract and retain our workforce through a dynamic and inclusive culture and by providing a comprehensive set of benefits, including",

We want to deliver the best experiences from the best teams, and one way we do that is by offering an array of development programs and resources to build diverse talent and empower our people to succeed through every step of their career. We put employees in the driver’s seat and give them access to mentoring, training, videos, books, job search and interview tips, and much more.\nBy strategically investing in the following three key areas of career development and learning, we are developing our talent now and for the future.\nEvolve skills and careers – Learn every day, champion relentless improvement, develop critical skills, explore career possibilities, and build the desired career;\nAdvance leadership expertise – Build critical leadership capabilities, enable leadership growth at all levels, and develop skills to lead in the future; and\nChampion belonging and inclusion – Promote inclusive habits and behaviors and enhance belonging and connectedness.\nBelonging and Inclusion\nOur diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are focused on fostering a workplace that helps us better serve our customers and communities across the nation. We aim to create an environment where employees feel included, valued and empowered, contributing to a stronger, more connected business. T-Mobile has an inclusive hiring process that seeks diverse talent to be candidates for employment, but all of our hiring decisions continue to be based solely on merit.\nEmployee Resource Groups (ERGs)\nMany of our employees participate in one of six Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and their sub-groups, which are instrumental in promoting connection. Each of these groups is open to any and all employees, and there are 38 chapters nationwide that organize volunteer opportunities and local events.\nVeterans & Allies Network;\nAccessibility Community at T-Mobile;\nMulticultural Alliance;\nAsia Pacific & Allies Network;\nBlack Empowerment Network;\nIndigenous Peoples Network;\nEleva Network (focused on the Latino community and allies);\nMultigenerational Network;\nWomen & Allies Network.\nThese groups offer immersive experiences, mentorship programs, networking opportunities, and community service projects. They are designed to help participants grow as professionals and community leaders\nExternal Diversity Councils\nIn partnership with civil rights organizations, we had previously established two External Diversity and Inclusion Councils. These councils offered guidance for our efforts in areas like workforce recruitment, procurement, community investment, and corporate governance. The work with these external councils concluded as planned after a successful 5-year collaboration and the councils have been dissolved.\nT-Mobile considers a broad range of suppliers, including those that are veteran-owned, disability-owned, woman-owned, minority-owned, and LGBT-owned, and we include small and large businesses of all kinds in our procurement processes. Purchases and contracts are awarded based on the best qualified and most competitive suppliers to enable T-Mobile’s success.\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nEfficiencies and Reducing Our Carbon Footprint\nWe are actively working to identify efficiencies in our energy usage and reduce our environmental impact by:\nPursuing a science-based net-zero emissions target for 2040, covering Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions;\nInvesting in renewable energy, meeting our RE100 pledge since 2021, through initiatives such as Virtual Power Purchasing Agreements and clean energy projects producing over 3.4 million megawatt hours annually;\nEnhancing energy efficiency in our facilities, including retail stores, data centers, and cell sites; and\nPromoting a circular economy through a robust device reuse and recycling program.\nResponsible Sourcing\nWe believe our suppliers are a valuable extension of our business and corporate values. Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines expectations around ethical business practices for our suppliers. We require our suppliers to operate in compliance with the laws, rules, regulations and ethical standards of the countries in which they operate or provide products or services. We expect our suppliers to share our commitment to ethical conduct and environmentally responsible business practices while they conduct business with or on behalf of us. Our Responsible Sourcing Policy further outlines T-Mobile’s expectations in this area.\nWe employ a third-party risk management (“TPRM”) process to screen for anti-corruption, global sanctions, human rights and environmental risks before engaging with a supplier. Our TPRM process also continuously monitors current suppliers for policy violations and risks.\nThe FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements that affect our operations and pending proceedings regarding additional or modified requirements that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911, 988 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, robocalling/robotexting, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, digital discrimination, consumer protection and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly.\nExcept for o",
