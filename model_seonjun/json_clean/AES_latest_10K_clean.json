AES expects to utilize this technology in conjunction with ongoing automation and digital initiatives to speed up delivery time and lower costs. 5B technology has been deployed at multiple locations in AES for a total of 23 MW across five projects in Panama, Chile, El Salvador, and the U.S., with future deployments expected across markets in the AES portfolio, including a 69 MW project in Puerto Rico.\n40 | 2024 Annual Report\nEnergy Markets and Regulatory Environment\nThe Chilean electricity industry is divided into three business segments: generation, transmission, and distribution. Private companies operate in all three segments, and generators can enter into PPAs to sell energy to regulated and unregulated customers, as well as to other generators in the spot market.\nChile operates in a single power market, referred to as the SEN, which is managed by the grid operator CEN. The SEN has an installed capacity of 35,461 MW and represents 99% of the installed generation capacity of the country.\nCEN coordinates all generation and transmission companies in the SEN. CEN minimizes the operating costs of the electricity system, while maximizing service quality and reliability requirements. CEN dispatches plants in merit order based on their variable cost of production, allowing for electricity to be supplied at the lowest available cost. In the south-central region of the SEN, thermoelectric generation is required to fulfill demand not satisfied by hydroelectric, solar, and wind output and is critical to provide reliable and dependable electricity supply under dry hydrological conditions in the highest demand area of the SEN. In the northern region of the SEN, which includes the Atacama Desert, thermoelectric capacity represents the majority of installed capacity. The fuels used for thermoelectric generation, mainly coal, diesel, and LNG, are indexed to international prices. In 2024, the installed capacity in the Chilean market was composed of thermoelectric (34%), solar (30%), hydroelectric (21%), wind (14%), and other fuel (1%) generation.\nHydroelectric plants represent a significant portion of the system's installed capacity. Precipitation and snow melt impact hydrological conditions in Chile. Rain occurs principally from June to August and snow melt occurs from September to December. These factors affect dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants, thereby influencing spot market prices.\nThe Ministry of Energy has primary responsibility for the Chilean electricity system directly or through the National Energy Commission and the Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels.\nAll generators can sell energy through contracts with regulated distribution companies or directly to unregulated customers. Customers whose connected demand capacity is higher than 5 MW are excluded from the regulated market and are referred to as unregulated customers. Customers with connected capacity between 0.5 MW and 5 MW can opt for regulated or unregulated contracts for a minimum period of four years. By law, both regulated and unregulated customers are required to purchase all electricity under contracts. Generators may also sell energy to other power generation companies on a short-term basis at negotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chile are denominated in USD, although payments are made in Chilean pesos.\nThe Dominican Republic energy market is a decentralized industry consisting of generation, transmission, and distribution businesses. Generation companies can earn revenue through short-term and long-term PPAs, ancillary services, and a competitive wholesale generation market. All generation, transmission, and distribution companies are subject to and regulated by the General Electricity Law.\nTwo main agencies are responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law:\nThe National Energy Commission drafts and coordinates the legal framework and regulatory legislation. They propose and adopt policies and procedures to implement best practices, support the proper functioning and development of the energy sector, and promote investment.\nThe Superintendence of Electricity's main responsibilities include monitoring compliance with legal provisions, rules, and technical procedures governing generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization of electricity. They monitor behavior in the electricity market in order to prevent monopolistic practices.\nIn addition to the two agencies responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce supervises commercial and industrial activities in the Dominican Republic as well as the fuels and natural gas commercialization to end users.\nThe Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system with 5,914 MW of installed capacity, composed of thermal (66%), solar (16%), hydroelectric (11%), and wind (7%) generation.\n41 | 2024 Annual Report\nEl Salvador's national electric market is composed of generation, distribution, transmission, and marketing businesses, a market and system operator, and regulatory agencies. The operation of the transmission system and the wholesale market is based on production costs with a marginal economic model that rewards efficiency and allows investors to have guaranteed profits, while end users receive affordable rates. The energy sector is governed by the General Electricity Law, which establishes two regulatory entities responsible for monitoring its compliance:\nThe National Energy and Hydrocarbons Direction is the highest authority on energy policy and strategy, and the coordinating body for",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor discussion of the Company's year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to Item 7.\n—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn 2024, AES delivered on its strategic and financial objectives. We completed construction or the acquisition of 3.0 GW of renewables and energy storage, construction of a 670 MW combined cycle gas plant, and signed long-term PPAs for an additional 4.4 GW of new renewable energy. See\nOverview of our Strategy\nincluded in Item 1.—\nCompared with last year, net income increased $984 million, from a net loss of $182 million in 2023 to net income of $802 million in 2024. This increase is the result of lower impairments, unrealized foreign currency gains in the current year versus losses in the prior year, gain on sale of AES Brasil, favorable contributions at the Utilities and New Energy Technologies SBUs, and higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year; partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income, and the prior year gain on sell-down of Fluence.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, decreased $189 million, from $2,828 million to $2,639 million, mainly driven by record-breaking drought conditions and outages in Colombia at the Renewables SBU, lower margins at the Energy Infrastructure SBU due to prior year margin at the hedged merchant Southland facilities that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year and higher outages; partially offset by higher contributions at the Utilities SBU and higher revenues from new projects at the Renewables SBU.\nAdjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes, a non-GAAP measure, increased $513 million, from $3,439 million to $3,952 million, primarily due to higher realized tax attributes driven by more renewables projects placed in service, partially offset by the drivers above.\nCompared with last year, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $2.03, from $0.34 to $2.37. This increase is mainly driven by lower long-lived asset impairments in the current year, higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year, prior year unrealized foreign currency losses at the Energy Infrastructure SBU, the gain on sale of AES Brasil, and lower income tax expense. This was partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income, and lower margins due to outages.\nAdjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, increased $0.38 from $1.76 to $2.14, mainly driven by higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year, a lower adjusted tax rate, and higher contributions from the Utilities SBU; partially offset by lower contributions from the Energy Infrastructure SBU.\n82 | 2024 Annual Report\nReview of Consolidated Results of Operations\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nEnergy Infrastructure SBU\nNew Energy Technologies SBU\nEnergy Infrastructure SBU\nNew Energy Technologies SBU\nTotal Operating Margin\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nGain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests\nNM\nGoodwill impairment expense\nAsset impairment expense\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses)\nNM\nNet equity in losses of affiliates\nINCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nNM\nGain (loss) from disposal of discontinued businesses, net of income tax benefit (expense) of $7, $7, and $0, respectively\nNM\nNET INCOME (LOSS)\nNM\nLess: Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries\nNM\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION\nNM\nAMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION COMMON STOCKHOLDERS:\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax\nNM\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\nNM\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION\nNM\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nComponents of Revenue, Cost of Sales and Operating Margin —\nRevenue includes revenue earned from the sale of energy from our utilities and the production and sale of energy from our generation plants, which are classified as regulated and non-regulated, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue also includes the gains or losses on derivatives associated with the sale of electricity.\nCost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business. Examples include electricity and fuel purchases, operations and maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization expenses, bad debt expense and recoveries, and general administrative and support costs (including employee-related costs directly associated with the operations of the business). Cost of sales also includes the gains or losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the purchase of electricity or fuel.\nOperating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales.\n83 | 2024 Annual Report\nConsolidated Revenue and Operating Margin\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n\nAdjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes\n_____________________________\nA non-GAAP financial measure. See S\nBU Performance Analysis—Non-GAAP Measures\nfor definition and Item 1.\nfor the respective ownership interest for key businesses.\nOperating Margin decreased $133 million driven by a $148 million impact primarily from record-breaking drought conditions in Colombia, alongside drier hydrological conditions in Brazil, a $45 million impact from outages at Colombia due to a flooding incident at the Chivor plant which occurred in June 2024, a $44 million impact from the sale of our controlling interest in AES Brasil, and a $29 million impact from higher fixed costs primarily due to an accelerated growth plan. These negative impacts were partially offset by a $33 million positive impact from new businesses, unrealized derivative gains of $61 million, and a $58 million impact from higher contracted energy sales.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $100 million primarily due to the drivers mentioned above, adjusted for NCI, unrealized derivatives, and depreciation expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes increased $600 million, primarily due to higher realized tax attributes driven by more projects being placed in service, partially offset by the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we realized $1,293 million and $593 million, respectively, from tax attributes earned by AES Clean Energy businesses.\n93 | 2024 Annual Report\nThe following table summarizes Operating Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes, and Adjusted PTC (in millions) for the periods indicated:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nAdjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes\n_____________________________\nA non-GAAP financial measure.

These increases are partially offset by $57 million due to higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in service, higher amortization of regulatory assets and changes in depreciation rates as a result of the 2024 Base Rate Order, $29 million due to the prior year one-time deferral of purchased power costs associated with the approval of ESP 4, and $25 million higher expected credit losses due to the temporary pause of customer disconnections related to the implementation of customer billing system upgrades.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $114 million primarily due to the drivers above, adjusted for NCI and depreciation expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes increased $116 million mainly due to the drivers above.\nAdjusted PTC increased $29 million primarily due to the operating margin drivers above, partially offset by higher interest expense due to increased borrowings and the prior year one-time deferral of carrying costs associated with the approval of ESP 4, and NCI adjustments.\nEnergy Infrastructure SBU\nThe following table summarizes Operating Margin and Adjusted EBITDA (in millions) for the periods indicated:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n_____________________________\nA non-GAAP financial measure. See S\nBU Performance Analysis—Non-GAAP Measures\nfor definition and Item 1.\nfor the respective ownership interest for key businesses.\nOperating Margin decreased $145 million, mainly driven by $110 million due to higher energy margin from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, $54 million due to the impact of the selldown of Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan, $51 million due to higher outages, $39 million due to end of commercial operations at Warrior Run in May 2024, and $31 million from lower LNG transactions.\nThe decrease in Operating Margin is partially offset by $82 million from a PPA termination loss recognized in the prior year and $45 million of unrealized gains resulting from derivatives.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $174 million, primarily due to the drivers above, adjusted for NCI and unrealized derivatives, and lower realized foreign currency losses.\n94 | 2024 Annual Report\nNew Energy Technologies SBU\nThe following table summarizes Operating Margin and Adjusted EBITDA (in millions) for the periods indicated:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n_____________________________\nA non-GAAP financial measure. See S\nBU Performance Analysis—Non-GAAP Measures\nfor definition and Item 1.\nfor the respective ownership interest for key businesses.\nOperating Margin increased $2 million, with no material drivers.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $24 million, primarily driven by a $44 million improvement in the share of results at Fluence mainly due to improved margins, partially offset by the prior year settlement of contractual claims with a battery module vendor. This increase was partially offset by $21 million higher general and administrative expenses mainly related to higher development costs.\nKey Trends and Uncertainties\nDuring 2025 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. Management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses, and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. If these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may have a material impact on our operating margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1.—\nTrade Restrictions and Supply Chain\n— In recent years, the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) has initiated investigations into whether imports into the U.S. of solar cells and panels from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam (“Southeast Asia”) are circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty (“AD/CVD”) orders on solar cells and panels from China. One such investigation initiated in April of 2022 resulted in a final determination by Commerce that circumvention would be deemed to occur under certain circumstances, resulting in the imposition AD and CVD duties on the imported cells and panels. Such determination and related matters remain the subject of ongoing litigation. Separate AD/CVD investigations initiated by Commerce in May 2024 resulted in preliminary determinations by Commerce that Southeast Asia countries were also dumping and receiving subsidies and therefore Commerce established CVD and AD rates on solar manufacturers. The U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) is also investigating this matter. If the Commerce and ITC investigations result in Commerce issuing AD/CVD orders, the orders are likely to be imposed in June 2025.\nSeparately, the United States maintains a global tariff (currently 14.25% ad valorem) on solar cells and modules pursuant to the Section 201 Safeguard Action on crystalline silicon photovoltaic products, which became effective in February 2018. On June 21, 2024, President Biden issued Proclamation 10779, revoking the exclusion of bifacial panels from safeguard relief previously proclaimed in Proclamation 10339, and reinstating the tariff on bifacial panels under the Section 201 Safeguard Action, subject to certain qualifications. These global tariffs are expected to expire in February 2026.\nThe United States also maintains a Section 301 tariff on certain Chinese made lithium-ion batteries and related components utilized for energy storage systems, with such tariff currently set at 7.5% and increasing to 25% effective January 1, 2026. There is also an ongoing AD/CVD investigation with respect to exports by China of natural and synthetic graphite used to make lithium-ion battery anode material. Any determinations or orders arising from such investigation could result in price increases.\nAdditionally, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”) seeks to block the import of products made with forced labor in certain areas of China, at any point in the supply chain, and may lead to certain suppliers being blocked from importing solar cells and panels to the U.S. While this has impacted the U.S. market, AES has managed this issue without significant impact to our projects. Further disruptions may impact our suppliers’ ability or\n95 | 2024 Annual Report\nwillingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory.\nThe Trump Administration has threatened or imposed tariffs on a wide range of countries and sectors. On February 10, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Orders modifying existing Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to expand their scope of applicability and imposing 25% tariffs on both products. At this time, we do not expect the modifications to tariffs on steel and aluminum to have a material impact on our business. On February 13, 2025, the Trump Administration announced a plan to counter non-reciprocal trading arrangements with all U.S. trading partners by determining the equivalent of a reciprocal tariff with respect to each foreign trade partner. On February 1, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and imposing a 10% additional tariff on imports from China and on March 4, 2025, this tariff was increased to 20%. We expect that additional tariffs on imports from China will increase overall costs for materials and parts that are imported to build and maintain renewable energy plants for the U.S. industry. However, AES has already shifted its supply chain outside of China for the vast majority of final products used to build and maintain renewable energy plants in the United States and we expect limited impact to 2025 and 2026 projects due to the recently announced tariffs on China. Any additional U.S. tariffs on imports from other countries or higher tariffs could negatively impact our business.\nThe impact of new tariffs, including reciprocal tariffs, or Commerce investigations, the impact of any additional adverse Commerce determinations or other tariff disputes or litigation, the impact of ",
