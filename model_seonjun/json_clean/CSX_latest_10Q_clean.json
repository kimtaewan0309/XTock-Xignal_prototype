MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Measures - Unaudited\nAdjusted Operating Results\nManagement believes that adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted net earnings per share, assuming dilution are important in evaluating the Company's performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability. These non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude the third quarter 2025 non-cash impairment of the remaining amount of Quality Carriers' goodwill, which is a significant item that is not considered indicative of future financial trends. The goodwill impairment was tax-effected using rates reflective of the applicable tax amounts related to the impairment charge. These adjusted results should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP operating results.\nThe following tables reconcile the Company's GAAP operating results to adjusted operating results (non-GAAP measures).\nQuarter Ended September 30, 2025\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet Earnings Per Share, Assuming Dilution\nGAAP Operating Results\n\nProceeds and Advances from Property Dispositions\nFree Cash Flow (before payment of dividends)\nOperating Statistics\nThe Company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. Training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the Company's employees. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, velocity increased by 2%, and dwell improved 8% versus prior year. Carload trip plan performance increased by 4% and intermodal trip plan performance increased by 1%. The Company continues to focus on operational improvements and executing the operating plan to deliver safe, reliable, and efficient service to customers.\nThe personal injury frequency index of 1.16 in third quarter 2025 improved 7% compared to prior year and the FRA train accident rate of 2.55 improved 21%. Safety is a top priority at CSX, and the Company is committed to reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers, and communities in which it operates.\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExpenses of $2.5 billion increased $235 million, or 10%, in third quarter 2025 when compared to the third quarter 2024.\nexpense increased $9 million due to the following:\nAn increase of $22 million was due to management and executive severance costs.\nAn increase of $15 million was due to inflation.\nA decrease of $19 million resulted from lower incentive compensation expense driven by lower expected payouts.\nAll other net costs decreased $9 million driven by efficiency savings, which include the impact of lower rail headcount, and other non-significant net decreases. These items were partially offset by higher trucking headcount, which includes impacts from acquiring previously independent affiliates.\nPurchased Services and Other\nexpense increased $54 million due to the following:\nInflation and higher volume drove an increase of $18 million.\nAn increase of $13 million was due to technology contract restructuring costs as well as advisory expenses.\nIncreased costs of approximately $13 million were due to the effects of network disruptions and rerouting impacts.\nGains on property dispositions were $7 million in third quarter 2025 compared to a $1 million loss in the prior year.\nAll other net costs increased $18 million resulting from a favorable inventory adjustment in the prior year, higher trucking casualty and rail freight damage claims in the current year, and other non-significant increases, which were partially offset by efficiency savings across the organization.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nexpense increased $8 million primarily as a result of a larger asset base.\ncosts increased $5 million as the impacts of additional gross ton-miles associated with reroutes as well as a 1% increase in locomotive fuel prices were partially offset by improved efficiency.\nEquipment and Other Rents\nexpense decreased $5 million due to several non-significant items.\nexpense for Quality Carriers was $164 million for 2025.\nInterest expense increased $4 million primarily due to higher average debt balances.\nOther income - net decreased $15 million primarily due to lower interest income.\nIncome tax expense decreased $86 million primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes.\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSources of Cash and Liquidity and Uses of Cash\nAs of the end of third quarter 2025, CSX had $618 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and other business opportunities, and contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan. See Note 7,\nDebt and Credit Agreements\nThe Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 27, 2025, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, CSX issued a total of $600 million of long-term debt.\nCSX has a $1.2 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in February 2028. At September 30, 2025, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured short-term commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any time. At September 30, 2025, the Company had no debt outstanding under the commercial paper program.\nPlanned capital investments for 2025 are expected to be consistent with 2024 spending at approximately $2.5 billion, except for additional costs to rebuild the Blue Ridge subdivision as a result of impacts from Hurricane Helene. Total spending on the Blue Ridge rebuild will exceed $500 million, including approximately $50 million spent in 2024 and approximately $440 million spent in the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Spending to sustain core infrastructure with a focus on safety and reliability will also remain a top priority. In addition, management is committed to investments that promote profitable growth, including projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives, which includes investments in locomotives and freight cars. CSX intends to fund capital investments primarily through cash generated from operations.\nThe Company's planned cash income tax payments and related payable and deferred liabilities were impacted by changes in bonus tax depreciation that were enacted into law on July 4, 2025, as part of Public Law 119-21, commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The impact of applying this provision will result in favorable cash tax impacts of approximately $250 million for the 2025 tax year.\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2.
