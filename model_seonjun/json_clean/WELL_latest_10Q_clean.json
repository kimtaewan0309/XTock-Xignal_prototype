See Note 5 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRepresents annualized contractual income that was being received in cash at date of disposition divided by stated purchase price.\nIncludes the disposition of unconsolidated equity method investments that owned 16 Seniors Housing Operating properties.\nAmica Senior Lifestyles Acquisition\nIn March 2025, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire a portfolio of 38 seniors housing communities and nine development parcels for aggregate consideration of C$4.6 billion. At closing, which is expected in early 2026, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, we expect to assume C$567 million of secured debt with an average interest rate of 3.7%.\nAnnounced Transactions Subsequent to September 30, 2025\nIn October 2025, we entered into definitive agreements and/or closed several acquisitions in the U.K. These acquisitions include:\nThe acquisition in the U.K., through a series of transactions of a portfolio of seniors housing real estate for £5.2 billion, including 6.6 million OP units. The portfolio consists of 111 properties held in a RIDEA structure managed by Barchester Healthcare, 152 properties subject to a triple-net lease with Barchester and 21 properties under development which will also be managed by Barchester in a RIDEA structure following development completion.\nThe acquisition of the HC-One Group portfolio in the U.K., which consists of 279 leased and owned seniors housing properties for £1.2 billion. The properties will be included in our Seniors Housing Operating segment. Our existing\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nreal estate loan receivable of £660 million, equity warrants and equity interest were settled in conjunction with the transaction, resulting in reduced cash consideration.\nWe have closed or are under contract to close an additional $4.7 billion of seniors housing acquisitions. The acquisitions not yet closed are subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and expected to close during the fourth quarter or in 2026.\nThese transactions are fully funded through available liquidity as of September 30, 2025 and the following:\nOn August 14, 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portfolio of 319 consolidated and unconsolidated outpatient medical properties for approximately $7.2 billion. Net proceeds are expected to total approximately $6.0 billion following the reinvestment of a portion of the gross proceeds into a mandatorily redeemable preferred equity investment in the disposed real estate portfolio accompanied by a profits interest. The disposition will occur in tranches expected to close over the next 12 months. In October 2025, we disposed of 123 properties with a gross purchase price of $2.0 billion with the closing of the first tranche of the transaction.\nIn October 2025, we issued $2.7 billion of Canadian-denominated unsecured term loans (approximately $2.0 billion based on the Canadian/U.S. Dollar exchange rates upon funding). The term loans mature on October 9, 2026, and bear interest at CORRA plus 0.30%.\nOur Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 of $0.74 per share. On November 20, 2025, we will pay our 218th consecutive quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of record on November 11, 2025.\nKey Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties\nWe utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes.\nOperating Performance\nWe believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (\"NICS\") per the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are the most appropriate earnings measures. Other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (\"FFO\") and consolidated net operating income (\"NOI\"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Please refer to the section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further discussion and reconciliations. These earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies.\nThe following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\nNOI\nNOI\nSeniors Housing Operating\nRepresents consolidated NOI and excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for additional information and reconciliation.\nOur primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in NOI and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and healthcare real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services, interest earned on outstanding loans receivable and interest earned on short-term deposits. These items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nTo mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance,\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ncapital improvement needs and market conditions among other things. We evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.\nIn addition to our asset management and research efforts, we aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guarantees and/or letters of credit. Also, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.\nhe nine months ended September 30, 2025, residen\nt fees and services and rental income\nted 77% and 19%, respectively, of total revenues. Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.\nOur primary sources of cash include resident fees and services revenue, rental income and interest receipts, interest earned on short-term deposits, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, issuances of debt and equity securities, including through our ATM program (as defined below), proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.\nWe also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under ou"
