Impacts on our revenues less transaction-based expenses and operating income associated with fluctuations in foreign currency are discussed in more detail under “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nThe following chart summarizes our ARR (in millions):\nARR for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature, or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.\nThe ARR chart includes:\nCapital Access Platforms\nProprietary market data subscriptions and annual listing fees within our Data & Listing Services business\nIndex data subscriptions and guaranteed minimum on futures contracts within our Index business\nSubscription contracts under our Workflow & Insights business\nFinancial Technology\nFinancial Crime Management Technology SaaS subscription contracts excluding one-time service requests\nRegulatory Technology SaaS and subscription and support contracts excluding one-time service requests\nCapital Markets Technology SaaS and subscription and support contracts excluding one-time service requests\nThe following chart summarizes our quarterly annualized SaaS revenues for Solutions, which comprises our Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology segments, for September 30, 2025 and 2024 (in millions):\nSEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS\nThe following tables present our revenues by segment:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nCapital Access Platforms\nFinancial Technology\nBrokerage, clearance and exchange fees\nTotal revenues less transaction-based expenses\n\nInterest expense on debt\nAccretion of debt issuance costs and debt discount\nInterest income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared with the same period in 2024 primarily due to a higher average cash balance.\nInterest expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared with the same periods in 2024 primarily due to lower average outstanding debt following the repayment of our 2025 Notes and the partial repurchases of several series of outstanding senior unsecured notes. See Note 8, “Debt Obligations,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net gain (loss) on divestitures includes gains on divestitures of our Nordic power futures business and our Nasdaq Risk Modelling for Catastrophes business, net of costs to sell, of which a portion are reflected for the three months ended September 30, 2025. See Note 4, “Divestitures,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions.\nOther income primarily represents realized and unrealized gains and losses from strategic investments related to our corporate venture program.\nNet income from unconsolidated investees increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared with the same periods in 2024 due to higher income recognized from our equity method investment in OCC driven by higher industry volumes. See “Equity Method Investments,” of Note 6, “Investments,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nThe following tables present our income tax provision and effective tax rate:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nIncome tax provision\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nIncome tax provision\nFor further discussion of our tax matters, see Note 16, “Income Taxes,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, to assess operating performance. We use non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.\nThe following tables present reconciliations between U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and diluted earnings per share and non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and diluted earnings per share:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nU.S. GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAdenza purchase accounting adjustment\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets\nMerger and strategic initiatives expense\nRestructuring charges\nGain on extinguishment of debt\nNet (gain) loss on divestitures\nNet income from unconsolidated investees\nLegal and regulatory matters\nPension settlement charge\nTotal non-GAAP adjustments\nNon-GAAP tax adjustments\nOther tax adjustments\nTotal non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq\nU.S. GAAP effective tax rate\nTotal adjustments from non-GAAP tax rate\nNon-GAAP effective tax rate\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share\nU.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share\nTotal adjustments from non-GAAP net income\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share\nWe believe that excluding the following items from the non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq provides a more meaningful analysis of Nasdaq’s ongoing operating performance and comparisons in Nasdaq’s performance between periods:\nAdenza purchase accounting adjustment:\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, as part of finalizing the purchase accounting of the Adenza acquisition, a one-time revenue reduction of $32 million was recorded, reflecting the net impact of the accounting change on AxiomSL subscription revenue from the date of the Adenza acquisition. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we excluded the reduction of $34 million as this relates to the prior year's impact of this change from our non-GAAP results. We did not exclude the $2 million offsetting impact of this change as it is related to the 2024 results.\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets:\nWe amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses and the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods.\nMerger and strategic initiatives expense:\nWe have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years that have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. These expenses primarily include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third-party transaction costs.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, and September 30, 2024, these costs included Adenza integration costs and other strategic initiative costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these costs were partially offset by the recognition of a termination fee due to Nasdaq in the second quarter of 2024, related to the termination of the then proposed divestiture of our Nordic power futures business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, these costs included a repayment of this fee due to the sale of the Nordic power futures business to another buyer, as designated in the settlement agreement.\nRestructuring charges:\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, following the closing of the Adenza acquisition, our management approved, committed to and initiated a restructuring program, to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization. We further expanded this restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2024 to accelerate our momentum. In addition, we completed our divisional realignment program in September 2024. See Note 19, “Restructuring Charges,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these programs.\nNet income from unconsolidated investees\n: We exclude our share of the earnings and losses of our equity method investments. This provides a more meaningful analysis of Nasdaq’s ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq’s performance between periods.
