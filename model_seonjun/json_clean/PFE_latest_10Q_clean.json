We will also participate in a direct purchasing platform, TrumpRx.gov, that will allow American patients to purchase certain medicines from us at significant discounts to current retail prices, where the large majority of the Company’s primary care treatments and some select specialty brands will be offered at savings that\nwill range as high as 85% and on average 50%. The agreements also provide a three-year grace period during which time our products under a Section 232 investigation will not face tariffs, provided the Company further invests in manufacturing in the U.S. Pfizer is now in the process of negotiating definitive agreements to implement these arrangements.\nProposed Acquisition of Metsera\n–– In September 2025, we and Metsera announced that the companies entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Metsera, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company accelerating the next generation of medicines for obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, for $47.50 in cash per Metsera share at closing, representing an enterprise value of approximately $4.9 billion. Additionally, the agreement includes a non-transferable contingent value right entitling holders to potential additional payments of up to $22.50 per share in cash tied to the achievement of three specific milestones: $5 per share following the Phase 3 clinical trial start of Metsera’s injectable GLP-1 receptor antagonist MET-097i+ amylin analog MET-233i combination, $7 per share following FDA approval of Metsera’s monthly MET-097i monotherapy and $10.50 per share following FDA approval of Metsera’s monthly MET-097i+MET-233i combination. We expect to finance the transaction through a combination of available cash and new debt. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of approval by Metsera’s shareholders.\nIn October 2025, we announced the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, with respect to Pfizer’s pending acquisition of Metsera. As such, all required regulatory approvals in respect of Pfizer’s acquisition of Metsera have been obtained.\nIn October and November 2025, we announced that Pfizer has filed lawsuits against Metsera, Novo Nordisk A/S (Novo Nordisk) and several related parties and individuals in the Delaware Court of Chancery and the U.S. District Court of the District of Delaware for claims relating to a competing proposal to acquire Metsera made by Novo Nordisk on October 25, including claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and tortious interference in contract arising from Metsera’s breach of its obligations under the merger agreement between Pfizer and Metsera, as well as various antitrust-related claims. Pfizer is requesting the Delaware Court of Chancery issue a temporary restraining order to block Metsera from terminating the merger agreement and seeks all appropriate remedies to ensure the terms of the merger agreement are fully enforced.\nOur Third Quarter 2025 and First Nine Months of 2025 Performance\ndecreased $1.0 billion, or 6%, in the third quarter of 2025 to $16.7 billion from $17.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting an operational decrease of $1.3 billion, or 7%, partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $203 million, or 1%. The operational decrease was primarily driven by declines from Paxlovid and Comirnaty largely due to lower infection rates impacting Paxlovid demand as well as a narrower vaccine recommendation for COVID-19 in the U.S. that reduced the eligible population for Comirnaty, partially offset primarily by increases in Eliquis, the Vyndaqel family and Nurtec ODT/Vydura.\ndecreased $842 million, or 2%, in the first nine months of 2025 to $45.0 billion from $45.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024, reflecting an operational decrease of $811 million, or 2%, as well as a de minimis impact of foreign exchange of $31 million. The operational decrease was primarily driven by a decline from Paxlovid, partially offset by increases from the Vyndaqel family, Eliquis, Padcev and Lorbrena.\nTotal Revenues by Geography\nTotal Revenues––Selected Product Discussion\nsections for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance. Certain of our vaccines, including Comirnaty, are subject to seasonality of demand, with a greater portion of revenues anticipated in the fall and winter seasons, as well as additional changes in recommendation for vaccination, and Paxlovid revenues trend with infection rates.
