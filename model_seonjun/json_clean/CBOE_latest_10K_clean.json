Fees, net of plan costs, from UTP, CTA, and OPRA are allocated and distributed to plan participants like us according to their share of tape fees based on a formula, required by Regulation NMS, which may take into account both trading and quoting activity.\nCash and Spot Markets\nWe are one of the largest equities market operators, operating four U.S. equities exchanges, international exchanges in Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia, as well as a number of alternative trading systems and an FX platform.\nOur four U.S. equities exchanges, BZX, EDGX, BYX and EDGA, which are fully electronic, operate various market and pricing models including price-time, and price-time with retail priority, as well as various pricing models, including maker-taker and taker-maker fee structures. In addition to these market models, each of the U.S. equity exchanges provides numerous specific order types that are designed to enhance their respective market models.\nBIDS Trading, the U.S. equities ATS market, which is fully electronic and is an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the Exchanges, utilizes a sponsored access model to provide anonymous executions in NMS stocks. Cboe and BIDS Trading collaborate in operating similar venues with our cash and spot markets in Australia, Canada, Europe, and Japan.\nOur fully electronic Canadian securities exchange, Cboe Canada Inc., offers four order books, NEO-L, NEO-N, NEO-D and MATCHNow, which operate various market models including maker-taker, taker-maker, large order priority, and frequent call matches with continuous execution opportunities, among others.\nIn Europe, we operate a number of market models, including continuous Lit orderbooks, periodic auction orderbooks, dark midpoint orderbooks, a post-closing cross, as well as two BIDS Europe orderbooks.\nCboe Australia is a regulated stock exchange that is fully electronic. Cboe Australia utilizes a model that charges a different ad valorem fee rate depending on whether a participant is making or taking liquidity.\nCboe Japan offers two fully electronic displayed markets, Cboe-Alpha and Cboe-Select. Cboe Japan also offers two fully electronic non-displayed markets, Cboe-Match, which matches VWAP orders during pre-market hours and Cboe BIDS Japan, which utilizes a price-time market model aiming for primary market mid-point trades.\nThe Cboe FX platform provides institutional FX trading services and utilizes a price-firmness-time priority market model. For our FX NDF markets, Cboe SEF utilizes a price-firmness-time priority market model.\nCboe operates five listing venues across the globe that are structured and designed, in the U.S. and Canada, for all types of equity instruments, such as ETPs, corporate securities, warrants and depositary receipts, while in the UK and European Union (\"EU\") they support ETPs only. In Australia, both ETPs and warrants are supported. Over the course of 2024, Cboe added approximately 730 listings across the globe and had approximately 2,460 listings as of December 31, 2024. Cboe also offers intralisting on its different equities markets through Cboe Global Listings, the first-of-its-kind, global listing network facilitating worldwide access to capital and secondary liquidity for companies and ETFs.\nOur subsidiary Cboe Clear Europe, a European central counterparty (“CCP”), provides post-trade clearing services, to stock exchanges, multilateral trading facilities and for over-the-counter equities trades and exchange-traded derivatives trades. Cboe Clear Europe acts as a central counterparty that, for its clearing participants, becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. As a result, it guarantees the timely performance of the settlement obligations of buyers and sellers and takes on the risk of the performance of the transactions that it clears. Additionally, as a Financial Market Infrastructure, Cboe Clear Europe is subject to strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight. Cboe Clear Europe clears equities and equity like instruments traded on 47 European trading segments. Cboe Clear Europe also clears equity derivative instruments traded on Cboe NL. In 2024, Cboe Clear Europe provided CCP protection for an average of €49 billion of cleared value on a daily basis. Through the process of netting, in 2024, Cboe Clear Europe eliminated 70%, or €34 billion of the average daily cleared value, leaving an average daily settlement value of €15 billion. In 2023, Cboe Clear Europe provided CCP protection for an average of €44 billion of cleared value on a daily basis. Through the process of netting, in 2023, Cboe Clear Europe eliminated 71%, or €31 billion of the average daily cleared value, leaving an average daily settlement value of €13 billion. As of November 25, 2024, Cboe Clear Europe also launched a first-of-its-kind service for SFT in cash equities and ETFs, which includes central clearing, settlement and post-trade lifecycle management.\nCboe Clear U.S. is a CFTC-registered derivatives clearing organization (“DCO”) that provides clearing and settlement of cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts for its affiliate, Cboe Digital Exchange.\nOur customers generally include financial institutions, trading platforms, institutional and individual investors, and professional traders.

For information regarding risks related to our customers see “Risk Factors.”\nThe industry in which we operate is intensely competitive. We believe we face competition on a number of factors, including:\nprice, quality and speed of our trade and clearing execution;\nfunctionality and ease of use of our trading and clearing platforms;\nreliability, integrity, depth of book, liquidity, range and functionality of our products and services;\nintegrity of our marketplaces;\ntechnological innovation and adoption;\nour brand awareness; and\nWe believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors through a variety of methods, including:\noffering access to a broad array of products and services, including proprietary products and market data;\noffering fee schedules and pricing models that both attract order flow and provide incentives to liquidity providers;\nproviding advanced technology that offers broad functionality, low latency, fast execution, ease of use, scalability, reliability, and security;\noffering efficient, transparent and liquid marketplaces;\noffering deep and liquid markets with opportunities for price improvement;\noffering broad trading platform access in the EU;\noffering efficient and transparent clearing services designed to help maximize netting opportunities;\nmaintaining close relationships with customers; and\nproviding customers with a comprehensive source of information on options and ETPs as well as extensive options education.\nIn our proprietary products, we compete against other futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products, as well as against financial market participants that offer similar over-the-counter derivatives. We also compete against certain multi-listed options products, such as SPY options and cash settled index options, which may offer similar market exposure of our proprietary products, such as SPX options.\nThe listed options industry is extremely competitive. As of December 31, 2024, our four options exchanges compete with 14 other U.S. options exchanges, in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology. Most of the equity and ETP options listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on the other exchanges. In addition, the options exchanges that we compete with set fees and rebates to attract multi-listed options business to their exchanges, which has historically reduced the net revenue per contract that we generate from multi-listed options, and the options exchanges that we compete with structure their options businesses in partnership with established market participants, such as consolidators, and other order flow providers, to increase their volume traded.\nOur U.S. equities and the BIDS Trading ATS compete against 12 other equities exchanges as of December 31, 2024, and over 25 other ATSs and single dealer platforms. Market participants have multiple venues for the execution of orders, including national securities exchanges and numerous off-exchange venues, including other ATSs and broker-dealers that internalize orders off-exchange. Additionally, corporate and ETP issuers have multiple venues they can choose from in the listing of their products. In Canada, our recognized Canadian securities exchange, Cboe Canada Inc., competes with several Canadian exchanges and ATSs. In Australia, our exchange, Cboe Australia, competes with other Australian exchanges and crossing systems. In Japan, our equities exchanges and PTSs, compete with several Japanese exchanges and other PTSs.\nThe market for execution and clearing services in Europe became more competitive following the introduction of MiFID II and the Regulation on Markets in Financial Instruments (Regulation (EU) No 600/2014) (“MiFIR”). Our major competitors in Europe include national stock exchanges, other pan-European MTFs, systematic internalizers, and other European clearinghouses.\nThe global FX market remains severely fragmented, with transparent automated marketplaces such as Cboe FX challenging a",

Cboe provides trading solutions and products in multiple asset classes, including equities, derivatives, and FX, across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Above all, the Company is committed to building a trusted, inclusive global marketplace that enables people to pursue a sustainable financial future.\nCboe’s subsidiaries include the largest options exchange and the third largest equities exchange operator in the U.S. In addition, the Company operates Cboe Europe, one of the largest equities exchanges by value traded in Europe, and owns Cboe Clear Europe, a leading pan-European equities and derivatives clearinghouse, BIDS Holdings, which owns a leading block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S., and provides block-trading services with Cboe market operators in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan, Cboe Australia, an operator of trading venues in Australia, Cboe Japan, an operator of trading venues in Japan, Cboe Clear U.S., an operator of a regulated clearinghouse, and Cboe Canada Inc., a recognized Canadian securities exchange. Cboe subsidiaries also serve collectively as a leading market globally for exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) listings and trading.\nOn April 25, 2024, the Company announced plans to refocus the digital asset business to leverage its core strengths in derivatives, technology, and product innovation. On May 31, 2024, the Company halted trading on the Cboe Digital spot market (“Cboe Digital spot market”). The Cboe Digital spot market is closed for all participant and trading purposes. In addition, the Company plans to transition the cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on Cboe Digital Exchange, LLC's Digital Exchange (\"Cboe Digital Exchange\"), to CFE in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review. The Company has brought Cboe Clear U.S. (formerly, Cboe Clear Digital) under unified leadership with the Global Head of Clearing, and expects to continue to facilitate the clearing of cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts.\nThe Company is headquartered in Chicago with offices in Amsterdam, Belfast, Hong Kong, Kansas City, London, Manila, New York, San Francisco, Sarasota Springs, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, and Toronto.\nPyth Tokens Unlocking\nIn October 2022, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cboe Netherlands Services Company B.V., entered into a Data Provider Agreement with Pyth Data Association (“Pyth”) to create a data feed and begin publishing limited derived equities market data for certain symbols from one of its four U.S. equities exchanges on the Pyth Network, a decentralized financial market data distribution platform for aggregated data. In exchange, Pyth granted Cboe Netherlands Services Company B.V. 16,666,666 restricted PYTH tokens which unlock annually over a four-year period in equal tranches; the first 25% tranche of PYTH tokens unlocked in May 2024. The PYTH tokens, which are included within intangible assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets, are carried at their historical value of $0.06 per token and are reviewed each reporting period for potential impairment. In May 2024, the Company recorded $1.0 million in market data fees revenue on the consolidated statements of income, which represents the historical value of the grant of 16,666,666 restricted PYTH tokens earned for satisfying the performance obligations outlined in the Data Provider Agreement. The Company has earned additional PYTH tokens by continuing to provide data to the Pyth Network through various Pyth Reward Programs. Through December 31, 2024, the Company earned an additional 725,000 PYTH tokens via the Pyth Reward Programs. The Company recorded additional intangible assets and revenue based on the token fair value when earned.\nSecurities Financing Transactions\nOn November 25, 2024, Cboe Clear Europe announced that it received regulatory approval to clear European SFT. The service supports key regulatory initiatives such as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, Central Securities Depository Regulation, and the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation, thereby promoting transparency, market integrity, and competition in European capital markets. As of December 31, 2024, no SFT trades had occurred on the Cboe Clear Europe platform.\nThe Company operates six reportable business segments: Options, North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Futures, Global FX, and Digital, which is reflective of how the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") reviews and operates the business, as discussed in Note 1 (\"Nature of Operations\"). The primary measure of segment performance used by the CODM in assessing segment-level performance and the allocation of resources is operating income (loss). The Company's CODM does not assess assets or income and expenses below operating income (loss) at the segment-level as key performance metrics. The Company has aggregated all of its corporate costs, as well as other business ventures, within the Corporate Items and Eliminations totals based on the decision that those activities should not be used to evaluate the operating performance of the segments; however, operating expenses that relate to activities of a specific segment have been allocated to that segment.\nThe Options segment includes options on market indices (“index options”), as well as on the stocks of individual corporations (“equity options”) and on ETPs such as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and exchange-traded notes (“ETNs”), which are “multi-listed” options and listed on a non-exclusive basis. These options are eligible to trade, as applicable, on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and/or other U.S. national security exchanges. Cboe Options is the Company’s primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on the Cboe Options trading floor in Chicago. C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options are all-electronic options exchanges, and typically operate with different market models and fee structures than Cboe Options. The Options segment also includes applicable market data fees revenues generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary options market data, index licensing, routing services, and access and capacity services.\nNorth American Equities.\nThe North American Equities segment includes U.S. equities and ETP transaction services that occur on fully electronic exchanges owned and operated by BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platform in the U.S. and Canada, and Canadian equities and other transaction services that occur on or through Cboe Canada Inc.’s order books. The North American Equities segment also includes corporate listing services on Cboe Canada Inc., ETP listings on BZX, the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. common stock listing, and applicable market data fees revenues generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary equities market data, routing services, and access and capacity services.\nEurope and Asia Pacific.\nThe Europe and Asia Pacific segment includes the pan-European listed equities and derivatives transaction services, ETPs, including exchange traded funds, exchange traded notes, and exchange traded commodities, and international depository receipts that are hosted on MTFs operated by Cboe Europe Equities (Cboe Europe and Cboe NL equities exchanges) and Cboe Europe Derivatives (“CEDX”). It also includes the ETP listings business on RMs and clearing activities of Cboe Clear Europe, as well as the equities transaction services of Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan, operators of trading venues in Australia and Japan, respectively, along with equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platform in Australia and Japan. Cboe Europe operates lit and dark books, a periodic auctions book, a closing cross book, and two BIDS orderbooks; a Large-in-Scale (“LIS”) trading negotiation facility and - predominantly for UK and Swiss symbols - a volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) trajectory crossing facility. Cboe NL, based in Amsterdam,\noperates similar business functionality to that offered by Cboe Europe (with exception of Trajectory Crossing), and provides for trading only in European Economic Area (“EEA”) symbols. Cboe Europe Derivatives, a pan-European derivatives platform, offers futures and options based on Cboe Europe equity indices, and single stock options. Cboe Clear Europe offers the clearing of equity and equity-like instruments for Cboe-operated and other regulated trading venues, the clearing of derivative transactions executed on CEDX, and has recently introduced a service to clear Securities Financing Transactions. This segment also includes Cboe Europe, Cboe NL, CEDX, Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\nThe Futures segment includes transaction services provided by CFE, a fully electronic futures exchange, which includes offerings for trading of VIX futures and other futures products, the licensing of proprietary market data, as well as access and capacity services. On April 25, 2024, the Company announced plans to transition the cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange, to CFE in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review.\nThe Global FX segment includes institutional FX trading services that occur on the Cboe FX fully electronic trading platform, non-deliverable forward FX transactions (“NDFs”) offered for execution on Cboe SEF, as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services. The segment includes transaction services for U.S. government securities executed on the Cboe Fixed Income fully electronic trading platform.\nThe Digital segment includes a regulated futures exchange (Cboe Digital Exchange) and a regulated clearinghouse (Cboe Clear U.S.), as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services. Prior to May 31, 2024, the Digital segment also included a U.S.-based spot digital asset trading market (“Cboe Digital spot market”). As of May 31, 2024, the Cboe Digital spot market is closed for all participant and trading purposes. In addition, the Company plans to transition the cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange, to CFE in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review. The Company expects that Digital will cease to be a distinct reportable business segment in the first quarter of 2025.\nGeneral Factors Affecting Results of Operations\nIn broad terms, our business performance is impacted by a number of drivers, including macroeconomic events affecting the risk and return of financial assets, investor sentiment, the regulatory environment for capital markets, geopolitical events, tax policies, central bank policies and changing technology, particularly in the financial services industry. We believe our future revenues and net income will continue to be influenced by a number of domestic and international economic trends, including:\ntrading volumes on our proprietary products such as VIX options and futures and SPX options;\ntrading volumes in listed equity securities, options, futures, and ETPs in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, clearing volumes in listed equity securities, options, futures, and ETPs in Europe and volumes in institutional FX trading;\nthe demand for and pricing structure of the U.S. tape plan market data distributed by the Securities Information Processors (\"SIPs\"), which determines the pool size of the industry market data fees we receive based on our market share;\nconsolidation and expansion of our customers and competitors in the industry;\nthe demand for information about, or access to, our markets and products, which is dependent on the products we trade, our importance as a liquidity center, quality and integrity of our proprietary indices, and the quality and pricing of our data and access and capacity services;\ncontinuing pressure in transaction fee pricing due to intense competition in the North American, European, and Asia Pacific markets;\nsignificant fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates or weakened value of currencies; and\nregulatory changes and obligations relating to market structure, increased capital or margin requirements, and those which affect certain types of instruments, transactions, products, pricing structures, capital market participants or reporting or compliance requirements.\nA number of significant structural, political, monetary, and global conflicts continue to confront the global economy, and instability could continue, resulting in an increased or subdued level of: inflation, market volatility, potential recession, supply chain constraints and costs, trading volumes, uncertainty, expenses, and increased costs and uncertainties related to CAT and the ability to collect on the promissory notes related to the funding of CAT, may have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nComponents of Revenues\nCash and Spot Markets\nRevenue aggregated into cash and spot markets includes associated transaction and clearing fees, the portion of market data fees relating to associated U.S. tape plan market data fees, associated regulatory fees, and associated other revenue from the Company’s North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Global FX, and Digital segments.\nRevenue aggregated into Data Vantage includes access and capacity fees, proprietary market data fees, and associated other revenue across the Company’s six segments.\nRevenue aggregated into derivatives markets includes associated transaction and clearing fees, the portion of market data fees relating to associated U.S. tape plan market data fees, associated regulatory fees, and associated other fees from the Company’s Options, Futures, Europe and Asia Pacific, and Digital segments.\nComponents of Cost of Revenues\nLiquidity payments are primarily correlated to the volume of securities traded on our markets. As stated above, we record the liquidity rebates paid to market participants providing liquidity, in the case of Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives, CFE, and Cboe Digital, as cost of revenue.
