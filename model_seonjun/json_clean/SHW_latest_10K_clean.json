  "item1_clean": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nThe Sherwin-Williams Company, founded in 1866 and incorporated in Ohio in 1884, is engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers primarily in North and South America with additional operations in the Caribbean region, Europe, Asia and Australia. Our principal executive offices are located at 101 West Prospect Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44115-1075, telephone (216) 566-2000. As used in this report, the terms “Sherwin-Williams,” “Company,” “we”, “us” and “our” mean The Sherwin-Williams Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAvailable Information\nWe also make available free of charge on our website our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Director Independence Standards, our Code of Conduct and the charters of our Audit Committee, our Compensation and Management Development Committee and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. You may access these documents on our Investor Relations website, investors.sherwin.com.\nBasis of Reportable Segments\nThe Company reports its segment information in the same way that management internally organizes its business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources. The Company has three reportable operating segments: Paint Stores Group, Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group (individually, a Reportable Segment and collectively, the Reportable Segments). The Company reports all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the Administrative function. For more information about the Reportable Segments, see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nPaint Stores Group consisted of 4,773 company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean region at December 31, 2024. Each store is engaged in servicing the needs of architectural and industrial paint contractors and do-it-yourself homeowners. These stores market and sell Sherwin-Williams\nand other controlled brand architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, OEM product finishes and related products. The majority of these products are produced by manufacturing facilities in the Consumer Brands Group. In addition, each store sells select purchased associated products. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the business of this segment.\nConsumer Brands Group\nThe Consumer Brands Group manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of branded and private-label architectural paint, stains, varnishes, industrial products, wood finishes products, wood preservatives, applicators, corrosion inhibitors, aerosols, caulks and adhesives to retailers, including home centers and hardware stores, dedicated dealers and distributors throughout North America, Latin America and Europe. Sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private-label products are performed by a direct sales staff. The products distributed through third-party customers are intended for resale to the ultimate end-user of the product. The Consumer Brands Group also consisted of 334 company-operated specialty paint stores in Latin America at December 31, 2024. Each store is engaged in servicing the needs of home, commercial and industrial projects to contractors and do-it-yourself customers in Latin America. These stores market and sell Sherwin-Williams\nand other controlled brand architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, OEM product finishes and related products which are branded for the Latin America market. In addition, each store sells select purchased associated products. The Consumer Brands Group also supports the Company’s other businesses around the world with new product research and development, manufacturing, distribution and logistics. Approximately 63% of the total sales of the Consumer Brands Group in 2024 were intersegment transfers of products primarily sold through the Paint Stores Group. The Consumer Brands Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales and related profitability of the segment. This segment incurred most of the Company’s capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance measures, manufacturing capacity expansion, operational efficiencies and maintenance projects at sites currently in operation.\nPerformance Coatings Group\nThe Performance Coatings Group develops and sells industrial coatings for wood finishing and general industrial (metal and plastic) applications, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings, coil coatings, packaging coatings and performance-based resins and colorants worldwide. This segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide. Sherwin-Williams\nand other controlled brand products are distributed through the Paint Stores Group, this segment’s 324 company-operated branches, a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and other third-party distributors. The Performance Coatings Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment.\nAdministrative Function\nThe Administrative function includes the administrative expenses and assets of the Company’s new global headquarters and research and development center, both currently under construction. In addition, it includes the operations of a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership, management and leasing of non-retail properties held primarily for use by the Company, including the Company’s current global headquarters and research and development center and disposal of idle facilities. The Administrative function’s remaining assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and deferred pension assets. Also included in the Administrative function was interest expense, interest and investment income, certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmental-related matters and other expenses that were not directly associated with the Reportable Segments. Sales of this function represented external leasing revenue. The Administrative function did not include any significant foreign operations. Gains and losses from the sale of property were not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the Administrative function.\nRaw Materials and Products Purchased for Resale\nRaw materials and products purchased for resale make up the majority of our consolidated Cost of goods sold. Raw materials may vary considerably by the specific paint or coating being manufactured but can generally be divided into the following categories: resins and latex, pigments, additives, solvents and metal or plastic containers. A significant portion of these raw materials are derived from various upstream petrochemical and related commodity feedstocks, notably propylene. Raw materials are sourced from multiple suppliers globally, typically within the geographic region where our products are being manufactured. A portion of specialized resins and other products are manufactured in house. We also purchase a variety of products for resale that are highly complementary to our paint and coating offerings, notably spray equipment and parts, floorcovering and assorted sundries. We attempt, if feasible, to mitigate our potential risk associated with the sourcing of our raw materials and other products through inventory management, strategic relationships with key suppliers, alternative sourcing strategies and long-term investments to expand our manufacturing capabilities.\nThe majority of the sales for the Reportable Segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters. Periods of economic downturn, however, can alter these seasonal patterns. There is no significant seasonality in sales for the Administrative function.\nIn order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters, the Company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter. Working capital items (inventories and accounts receivable) are generally financed through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of the Company’s liquidity and capital resources, see Item 7 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Cash Flow.\nTrademarks and Trade Names\nCustomer recognition of trademarks and trade names owned or licensed by the Company collectively contribute significantly to our sales. The major trademarks and trade names used by each of the Reportable Segments are set forth below.\nSherwin-Williams®, A-100®, Builders Solution®, Captivate®, Cashmere®, Duration®, Emerald®, Gallery Series™, Kem Tone®, Latitude®, Loxon®, Metalatex®, Novacor®, Painters Edge Plus®, ProClassic®, ProCraft®, Pro Industrial™, ProMar®, Scuff Tuff®, SuperDeck®, SuperPaint®, Woodscapes®\nConsumer Brands Group:\nCabot®, Colorgin®, Condor®, Dupli-Color®, Dutch Boy®, Geocel®, HGTV HOME® by Sherwin-Williams, Krylon®, Minwax®, Purdy®, Ronseal®, Thompson’s® WaterSeal®, Valspar®, White Lightning®\nPerformance Coatings Group:\nSherwin-Williams®, Acrolon®, AcromaPro®, ATX®, DeBeer Refinish®, Duraspar®, EcoDex®, Envirolastic®, Excelo®, EzDex®, Fastline®, Firetex®, Fluropon®, Gross & Perthun™, Heat-Flex®, House of Kolor®, Huarun®, ICA®, Inver®, Kem Aqua®, Klumpp Coatings™, Lazzuril®, Macropoxy®, Martin\nSenour®, Matrix Edge®, M.L. Campbell®, Octoral®, Oskar Nolte™, PermaClad®, Polane®, Powdura®, Sayerlack®, Sher-Wood®, Sumaré®, Ultra 9K®, Ultra 7000®, ValPure®, Valspar®\nAlthough patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment, each segment derives a portion of its income from the licensing of technology, trademarks and trade names to foreign companies.\nBacklog and Productive Capacity\nBacklog orders are not typically significant in the business of any Reportable Segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment. We believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products during 2025.\nWe experience competition from many local, regional, national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and related products. We are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers, however, our competitive position varies for our different products and markets.\nIn the Paint Stores Group, competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment.\nIn the Consumer Brands Group, domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded and private-label paint and coatings products as well as other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price are key competitive factors for this segment.\nThe Performance Coatings Group has numerous competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and several others with niche products. Key competitive factors for this segment include technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and pric",
  "item7_clean": "Adjusted Diluted Net Income Per Share\nManagement believes investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of diluted net income per share excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense and certain other adjustments. Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense is excluded from diluted net income per share due to its significance as a result of the purchase price assigned to finite-lived intangible assets at the date of acquisition and the related impact on underlying business performance and trends. While these intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the related revenue is not excluded. This adjusted earnings per share measurement is not in accordance with US GAAP. It should not be considered a substitute for earnings per share in accordance with US GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following tables reconcile diluted net income per share computed in accordance with US GAAP to adjusted diluted net income per share.\nDiluted net income per share\nAcquisition-related amortization expense\nAdjusted diluted net income per share\nDiluted net income per share\nItems related to Restructuring Plan:\nImpairment of assets related to China divestiture\nGain on divestiture of domestic aerosol business\nDiscrete income tax expense related to China divestiture\nImpairment related to trademarks\nDevaluation of the Argentine peso\nAcquisition-related amortization expense\nAdjusted diluted net income per share\nThe tax effect is calculated based on the statutory rate and the nature of the item, unless otherwise noted.\nAcquisition-related amortization expense, which is included within Selling, general and administrative expenses, consists of the amortization of intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition. These intangible assets are primarily customer relationships and intellectual property and are being amortized over their remaining useful lives.\nAdjusted Segment Profit\nManagement believes investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of Segment profit excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense and certain other adjustments. Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense is excluded from Segment profit due to its significance as a result of the purchase price assigned to finite-lived intangible assets at the date of acquisition and the related impact on underlying business performance and trends.

These intangible assets are primarily customer relationships and intellectual property and are being amortized over their remaining useful lives.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These determinations were made based upon management’s best estimates, judgments and assumptions that were believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the critical accounting policies and estimates described below. However, application of these critical accounting policies and estimates involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nAll of the significant accounting policies that were followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined principally on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method based on inventory quantities and costs determined during the fourth quarter and market representing current replacement cost, which is the cost to purchase or reproduce the inventory. Market shall not exceed net realizable value and shall not be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin. Inventory quantities are adjusted throughout the year as formal cycle counts are completed, or during the fourth quarter as a result of annual physical inventory counts. If inventories accounted for on the LIFO method are reduced on a year-over-year basis, then liquidation of certain quantities carried at costs prevailing in prior years occurs. Management records an estimate of the lower of cost or market whenever the utility of inventory is impaired by damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes based on historical experience and current trends through reductions to inventory cost by recording a provision included in Cost of goods sold. If management estimates that the reasonable market value is below cost or determines that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to current market price is provided for in the reserve for obsolescence. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information regarding the impact of the LIFO inventory valuation and the reserve for obsolescence.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, management performs impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate impairment has occurred on a more likely than not basis. An optional qualitative assessment allows companies to forego the annual quantitative test if it is not more likely than not that impairment has occurred based on monitoring key Company financial performance metrics and macroeconomic conditions. The qualitative assessment is performed when deemed appropriate.\nManagement tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Per the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below the operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics. At the time of goodwill impairment testing (if performing a quantitative assessment), management determines fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. If the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value, the difference represents the amount of impairment attributable to the reporting unit. The use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing include a discount rate, growth rates, cash flow projections and a terminal value rate. Discount rates are set by using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) methodology. The WACC methodology considers market and industry data as well as Company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Management, considering industry and Company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and a long-term growth rate. As an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model, the aggregate of all reporting units’ fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the Company within a reasonable and supportable control premium.\nThe Company had seven components, some of which are aggregated due to similar economic characteristics, to form three reporting units (also the reportable operating segments) with goodwill as of October 1, 2024, the date of the annual impairment test. The Company performed the optional qualitative impairment test as of October 1, 2024, and determined that there was no indication of impairment on a more likely than not basis in the Company’s reporting units.\nManagement tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level, as determined by appropriate asset valuations at acquisition. Management utilizes the royalty savings method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset or trademark. In this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include a discount rate, a royalty rate, growth rates, sales projections, a terminal value rate and to a lesser extent, a tax rate. The discount rate used is similar to the rate developed by the WACC methodology considering any differences in Company-specific risk factors between reporting units and trademarks. The royalty rate is established by management and valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts. Management, considering industry and Company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant trademark. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and a low long-term growth rate. The royalty savings valuation methodology and calculations used in 2024 impairment testing are consistent with prior years. The Company performed the optional qualitative impairment test as of October 1, 2024, and determined that there was indication of impairment on a more likely than not basis in certain of the Company’s trademarks. The resulting quantitative impairment test performed as of October 1, 2024 did not result in any trademark impairment.\nThe discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed from the perspective of a market participant. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of goodwill and intangible assets and the impairment tests performed in accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets, including operating and finance lease right-of-use assets, may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed, impairment tests are performed or the useful life is adjusted. Undiscounted cash flows are used to calculate the recoverable value of long-lived assets to determine if such assets are recoverable. If the carrying value of the assets is deemed to not be recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets as determined in accordance with the Fair Value Topic of the ASC. If the usefulness of an asset is determined to be impaired, an updated useful life is assessed based on the period of time for projected use of the asset. Fair value approaches and changes in useful life are based on certain assumptions and information available at the time the valuation or determination is performed. Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value or useful life considering the current economic conditions. As of October 1, 2024, the Company performed an analysis and determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances to suggest the carrying value of each long-lived asset group is not recoverable and therefore, no further impairment tests were performed. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the reductions in carrying value or useful life of long-lived assets in accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC.\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nTo determine the Company’s ultimate obligation under its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, management estimates the future cost of benefits and attributes that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works. To determine the obligations of the benefit plans, management uses actuaries to calculate such amounts using key assumptions which include discount rates, inflation rates, long-term investment returns, mortality, employee turnover, rate of compensation increases and medical and prescription drug costs. Management reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most current information available is considered. An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management’s control could have a direct impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nIn accordance with the Retirement Benefits Topic of the ASC, the Company recognizes each plan’s funded status as an asset for overfunded plans and as a liability for unfunded or underfunded plans. Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are recognized and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The amounts recorded in AOCI will continue to be modified as actuarial assumptions and service costs change, and all such amounts will be amortized to expense over a period of years through the net pension and net periodic benefit costs. Based on facts and circumstances, the expense amounts recorded in AOCI can also have accelerated amortization due to certain plan changes, including those that result in a\ncurtailment. See Note 8 to the consoli",
