Our technology empowers millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world, providing everyone the opportunity to grow and thrive. Our Marketplace platforms, including our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its localized counterparts, our off-platform marketplaces and our suite of mobile apps, together, create one of the world's largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection.\nGross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) grew during the first nine months of 2025 as we executed on our strategy across Focus Categories, country-specific investments, and horizontal initiatives. GMV growth was partially offset by pressure in discretionary spending across certain markets primarily resulting from geopolitical events, inflationary pressure, elevated interest rates, and changes in and uncertainty regarding global tariffs and trade policies, which we expect to continue through the end of 2025.\nFX-Neutral Presentation\nIn addition to presenting net revenues in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we also present foreign exchange neutral (“FX-Neutral”) net revenues to supplement our results of operations presented in accordance with GAAP and to enhance investors’ understanding of our global business performance by excluding the positive or negative year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on reported net revenues. We define FX-Neutral net revenues as GAAP net revenues minus the exchange rate effect, which we calculate by applying prior period foreign currency exchange rates to current year transactional currency amounts, excluding hedging activity. We believe presenting FX-Neutral net revenues provides useful information to both management and investors by isolating the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, as we have historically reported certain FX-Neutral results to investors, we believe that continuing to include these FX-Neutral measures provides consistency in our financial reporting. FX-Neutral net revenues are non-GAAP financial measures that are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and may be calculated differently than other “FX-Neutral,” “constant currency,” or similarly titled measures used by other companies. FX-Neutral net revenues are not presented as an alternative to GAAP net revenues and should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with GAAP net revenues.\nNet revenues increased 9% to $2,820 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $2,576 million during the same period in 2024. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to higher GMV, increased penetration of first party advertising and the ramping of our U.K. managed shipping program. The increase in net revenues was partially offset by lower seller fees in connection with our U.K. consumer-to-consumer initiative.\nOperating margin decreased to 20.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 23.1% during the same period in 2024 primarily due to higher non-recurring general and administrative expenses related to legal matters and restructuring.\nWe generated cash flow from continuing operating activities of $934 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $755 million in the same period in 2024.\nWe repurchased $625 million of common stock and paid $132 million in cash dividends during the three months ended September 30, 2025.\nOn October 22, 2025, we redeemed the $425 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding 5.900% senior notes due in November 2025. Total cash consideration paid was $425 million, as the redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount. In addition, we paid accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount.\nIn October 2025, our Audit Committee, pursuant to delegated authority from our Board of Directors (our “Board”), declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share of common stock to be paid on December 12, 2025 to stockholders of record as of November 28, 2025.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe have one reportable segment, which reflects how our chief operating decision maker, our President and Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses performance of the business. This reportable segment includes our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com and its localized counterparts, our off-platform marketplaces and our suite of mobile apps. The accounting policies of this segment are the same as those described in “Note 1 — The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe generate revenues from the following activities:\nMarketplace revenues\nprimarily consist of commissions related to the connection service including final value fees, listing fees, feature fees, and foreign exchange fees. Marketplace revenues also include store subscription fees, shipping fees, and certain other fees. Marketplace revenues are reduced by customer incentive programs, including discounts, coupons, and rewards.\nAdvertising revenues\nprimarily consist of fees charged to sellers to promote their listings on our Marketplace platforms, as well as third-party advertising fees.\nThe following table presents net revenues for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):\n\nof hedging losses during the same periods in 2024.\nNet revenues increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to higher GMV, increased penetration of first party advertising and the ramping of our U.K. managed shipping program. The increase in net revenues was partially offset by lower seller fees in connection with our U.K. consumer-to-consumer initiative.\nThe increase in GMV for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 was primarily driven by the continued execution of our strategic initiatives as consumer demand improved through the first nine months of 2025 and lower than expected impact of tariffs and trade policy changes. GMV growth in Focus Categories, including Collectibles, Motors Parts & Accessories, Luxury goods, Refurbished, Apparel and Sneakers, outpaced the remainder of our Marketplace. The increase in GMV was partially offset by the impact of tariffs, including the elimination of the U.S. de minimis trade exemption during the third quarter of 2025.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, we experienced an increase in canceled orders as buyers and sellers adapted to new U.S. trade policies. This trend may continue depending on the state of future global trade policies and the speed with which our buyers and sellers adjust to these changes or respond to uncertainty around global trade policies. Changes in return and cancellation rates can impact our GMV growth rate and related take rate. As a result, we clarified above that our definition of GMV includes returns and cancellations. We have consistently included returns and cancellations in our previously reported GMV.\nIn the United States, GMV growth was driven by favorable trends in consumer demand during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 as reflected in the broad-based strength across categories with particularly strong performance in Trading Cards. The increase in GMV was also attributable to increases in both sold items and average selling price, the expansion of the Klarna buyer payment option and efficiency in lower-funnel marketing spend.\nInternational GMV growth was primarily driven by cross-border trade, led by exports from Greater China and Japan into our major markets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024. Cross-border trade was also a significant contributor to growth in Focus Categories. Across international markets, we continued to experience challenging macroeconomic conditions through the first nine\nmonths of 2025 with recent enhancements to our consumer-to-consumer initiative in the U.K. contributing to an overall increase in U.K. volume.\nCost of Net Revenues\nCost of net revenues represents costs associated with customer support, site operations and payment processing. Significant components of these costs primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment and amortization expense, bank transaction fees, credit card interchange and assessment fees, authentication costs, shipping costs and indirect tax expenses. The following table presents cost of net revenues for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages):\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation (including stock-based compensation), contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment, legal expenses, restructuring, insurance premiums and professional fees. Our legal expenses, including those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily due to $28 million of restructuring costs, $9 million in employee-related costs and a legal accrual release in the third quarter of 2024 of $50 million.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily due to $89 million of senior leader transitions and restructuring costs, $61 million of legal accruals recorded during 2025, $32 million in employee-related costs and legal accrual releases in 2024 of $56 milli"
