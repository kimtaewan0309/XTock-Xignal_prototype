Scotch whisky must be matured in oak casks for at least three years in Scotland. We comply with all of the applicable laws and regulations.\nOur operations are also subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, and our policy is to comply with them. Complying with these statutes and regulations has not materially impacted our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position, and is not expected to have a material impact during fiscal 2026.\nIntegrated Strategy and Performance\nFor more than 150 years, Brown-Forman and the Brown family have been committed to driving sustainable growth and preserving Brown-Forman as a thriving, family-controlled, independent company. The image on the left illustrates our highest ambition, “Nothing Better in the Market,” surrounded by the values that have guided us for decades: integrity, respect, trust, teamwork, and excellence. In addition to these guiding principles, our success depends on several strategic priorities, as illustrated in the image on the right: the quality of our brands within our portfolio, our geographic reach, the talent and diversity of our people, and the return on our investments. Moreover, taking an integrated approach means that many aspects of our company contribute to this value creation and are fundamental to our strategy, including our spirit of commitment to environmental sustainability, alcohol and marketing responsibility, culture and inclusion, and to building communities in which we live and work.\nOver the past five fiscal years, we faced a challenging, volatile environment, including supply chain disruptions and a global pandemic. Our employees’ unique mix of agility, resilience, energy, and collaboration enabled us to succeed despite these challenges. Our values drive our decisions, and our core purpose and our highest ambition continue to guide us as we move forward to a reimagined future with renewed enthusiasm for the opportunities that lie ahead. We believe we are well positioned to navigate the ever-changing landscape. We will make bold moves with a commitment to improve continuously as we work together to deliver sustained long-term growth.\nPortfolio and Responsibility\nWe seek to build brands and create stockholder value responsibly by delivering strong, sustainable growth, solid margins, and high returns on invested capital. We focus on building brands that can be meaningful for our company and our legal drinking age consumers (consumers) over the longer term. We aim to grow our premium spirits portfolio both organically and through innovation. Opportunistically and thoughtfully, we also consider acquisitions and partnerships that will enhance our capacity to deliver meaningful growth, improve margins, and increase stockholder returns.\nWe strive to grow our brands and enhance consumers’ experience with them. Even as we do so, we remain committed to marketing our brands responsibly and promoting responsible drinking. Regulation of our industry is not new, and external interest from the World Health Organization and other health bodies has grown over time. We uphold high standards of self-regulation by adhering to industry guidelines on responsible marketing and advertising. We promote alcohol responsibility both independently and with industry organizations, such as the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking, the Foundation for Advancing Alcohol Responsibility (responsibility.org) in the United States, the Portman Group in the United Kingdom, DrinkWise in Australia, and FISAC in Mexico.\nThe Jack Daniel’s family of brands, led by Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey (JDTW), is our most valuable asset – the engine of our overall financial performance and the foundation of our leadership position in the American whiskey category.\nWe strive to strengthen the brand’s leadership position continually, and will work steadfastly to keep JDTW relevant to consumers worldwide. We will also pursue opportunities to grow the Jack Daniel’s family of brands across markets, premium-and-above price points, channels, and consumer groups. Product innovation continues to contribute meaningfully to our performance. Different Jack Daniel’s expressions have brought new consumers to the franchise, including Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey (2011), Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire (2015), Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Apple (2019), Jack Daniel’s 10 Year Old (2021), Jack Daniel’s Bonded Tennessee Whiskey and Triple Mash Blended Straight Whiskey (2022), Jack Daniel’s Bonded Rye - Tennessee Rye Whiskey, Jack Daniel’s American Single Malt, and Jack Daniel’s 12 Year Old (2023), Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel - Barrel Proof Rye (2024), and our most recent launch, Jack Daniel’s 14 Year Old (2025), which individually and collectively add great value to the company and to our consumers the world over.\nIn addition to the leadership of our Jack Daniel’s family of brands, we expect strong worldwide growth from our other whiskey brands, particularly Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. Woodford Reserve is the leading super-premium American whiskey globally,\ngrowing volumes at a strong double-digit compound annual growth rate since the brand was introduced over 25 years ago. Woodford Reserve sold over 1.8 million nine-liter cases for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025. We believe the brand is poised for continued growth as the bourbon category continues to grow around the world. Old Forester has continued its return to prominence in the United States and in select international markets. Innovation has played an important role in the premiumization of both of these brands, including the success of high-end expressions such as Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, Woodford Reserve Double Double Oaked, and the Old Forester Whiskey Row Series.\nOutside of our American whiskey brands, we believe our portfolio remains well positioned in other high-growth categories, with meaningful premium brands and a focus on accelerating our super-premium portfolio. Our tequila portfolio is led by two brands steeped in Mexican heritage, Herradura and el Jimador. We remain committed to the growth of our tequila business in the United States and the long-term growth prospects of this business globally. We believe that our Scotch whiskies The Glendronach, Benriach, and Glenglassaugh, and our Irish whiskey, Slane, are well positioned in their respective categories. We expect them all to contribute meaningfully over the longer term. In addition, the acquisitions of Gin Mare (2022) and Diplomático (2023) provide us with leadership positions in the super-premium-and-above gin and rum categories, respectively, and we look to grow these brands globally.\nOur RTD portfolio continues to evolve globally. In June 2022, we jointly announced a global relationship with The Coca-Cola Company to introduce the iconic Jack & Coke cocktail as a branded, ready-to-drink, pre-mixed cocktail. Since the announcement, we have launched the product in over 25 markets, including top RTD markets such as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Germany. Starting in 2021, Jack Daniel’s Country Cocktails in the United States are produced, sold, and distributed under our relationship with the Pabst Brewing Company.\nWe appreciate the power of our brands to enrich the experience of life, and we believe it is our duty to ensure that our products are marketed with deep respect for our consumers. Our mission for alcohol responsibility is to empower mindful choices around beverage alcohol. We launched the Pause campaign in 2019. Pause is Brown-Forman’s driving effort to encourage mindful choices. In 2022, we launched our 2030 Alcohol Responsibility strategy to prioritize strategic programs and partnerships, in-market tools and resources, and to continue empowering our employees and business partners. We execute our 2030 Alcohol Responsibility strategy through the lens of our Pause campaign to showcase the importance of alcohol responsibility and inspire action among our consumers, colleagues, and business partners.\nThe United States remains our largest market, and growth there is important to our long-term success. We expect to foster this growth by emphasizing fast-growing spirits categories, continuing product and packaging innovation, and building brands within growing consumer segments. This includes increasing emphasis on inclusive, digital, and integrated marketing and the growth of our e-commerce capabilities to better connect and engage with consumers where they are.\nOutside the United States, our improved routes to consumers continue to increase our competitiveness. Owned distribution enables us to have a more direct connection with customers and consumers, and is an important part of our strategic growth. In May 2025, we established our owned-distribution organization in Italy.\nPeople, Culture, Ethics, and Compliance\nAs we work to increase our brands’ relevance and appeal to diverse consumer groups around the world, we believe a diversity of experiences, perspectives, and mindsets within our own workforce is essential. Our strategy is to embed inclusion into everything we do. We prioritize initiatives that help us build a workforce that reflects our global consumers, create a culture of inclusion, retain and expand our consumer base, and be a good neighbor in our communities. We believe this will make us a better employer, help us build iconic brands, and make us a more sustainable business.\nOne of the main drivers of our inclusive culture is the continued growth and leadership of our ten Employee Resources Groups (ERGs), which are open to all employees. We believe ERGs are instrumental in enriching our company’s culture and our employees’ experience by supporting development and engagement of our diverse workforce; driving cultural awareness and competency across the organization; enabling authentic engagement with our consumers; and creating spaces for our employees and their allies to connect with, support, and advocate for one another.\nOur core values of integrity, respect, trust, teamwork, and excellence form the foundation of our ethics and compliance program. “Values Drive Decisions” is the key theme of this program, and we use it to teach our employees to rely on our values when faced with a difficult decision and to “speak up” if they believe they, a colleague, or a business partner may have violated the law, our Code of Conduct, or company policy. In countries where we operate, we offer a third-party service to employees and others who choose to “speak up” anonymously. As we train our managers, we reinforce our commitment to non-retaliation and maintaining a “speak up” culture.\nWe convey our compliance expectations to employees via our Code of Conduct, and our employees certify annually that they will comply with it and report potential violations. The Code of Conduct details our expectations with respect to different risks scenarios; provides links to Q&As, policies, and training; and gives contact details for subject-matter experts. We refresh our Code of Conduct and certification annually and make it available in 13 languages.\nInvestment and Sustainability\nFor over a century and a half, we have learned that long-term success requires investment and a mindset of sustainability. We understand the need to invest in our brands, global supply chain facilities, homeplace and visitor centers, and aging inventory. We also understand the importance of investing in our people, communities, and the environment. We recognize that climate change is a business issue with risks and opportunities. As such, we are committed to actions that will ensure the long-term health of the planet and our business. In fiscal 2025, we revised our 2030 Sustainability Strategy to account for our current organization and to align our efforts with industry best prac",
