Our nightlife and entertainment offerings at Wynn Las Vegas include two nightclubs and a beach club, and two theaters presenting an exclusive theatrical production and various headliner entertainment act.\nEncore Boston Harbor\nOn June 23, 2019, we opened Encore Boston Harbor, an integrated resort in Everett, Massachusetts, adjacent to Boston along the Mystic River. The property features approximately 210,000 square feet of casino space with 172 table games, 24 poker tables and approximately 2,724 slot machines, private and high-limit gaming areas, and a sports book. Encore Boston Harbor also features a luxury hotel tower with a total of 671 guest rooms and suites, which offers a spa and salon. In addition, Encore Boston Harbor offers 16 food and beverage outlets and a nightclub, approximately 8,186 square feet of retail space, and approximately 71,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. Public attractions include a waterfront park, floral displays, and water shuttle service to downtown Boston.\nFuture Development Projects\nIn January 2022, we, along with Island 3 AMI FZ-LLC and RAK HH IR FZ-LLC, announced plans for the development and management of Wynn Al Marjan Island, a destination integrated resort property in the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. Wynn Al Marjan Island, which is currently under construction, is anticipated to be completed and open to the public in 2027, featuring an over 1,500-room hotel, luxury villas, a high-end shopping mall, a state-of-the-art meeting and convention facility, an exclusive spa, more than 20 restaurants and lounges, 225,000 square feet of gaming area, a wide array of entertainment choices including a nightclub and a beach club, and other amenities. The planned integrated resort will leverage Wynn Resorts' expertise in developing and operating luxury hospitality destinations, and is expected to create substantial value to the local economy by accelerating tourism, creating jobs, and contributing to the growth of related sectors.\nMarket and Competition\nThe casino resort industry is highly competitive. We compete with other high-quality resorts on the basis of the range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment, themes and size, among other factors. We seek to differentiate our integrated resorts by delivering superior design and customer service.\nMacau, located in the Greater Bay Area, is governed as a special administrative region of China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of Hong Kong. The journey between Macau and Hong Kong takes approximately 15 minutes by helicopter, 30 minutes by road via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, and one hour by jetfoil ferry. Macau, which has been a casino destination for more than 60 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China and two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane, between which the Cotai area is located. In addition to Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A. (\"Wynn Macau SA\"), SJM Resorts, S.A. (\"SJM\"), Galaxy Casino, S.A. (\"Galaxy\"), Venetian Macau, S.A. (\"Venetian Macau\"), Melco Resorts (Macau) Limited (\"Melco\"), and MGM Grand Paradise Limited (\"MGM Macau\") are permitted to operate casinos in Macau, with a total of 30 casinos currently in operation.\nBoth the Macau gaming market and visitation to Macau grew significantly from liberalization in 2002 up until the outbreak of COVID-19, and then fell meaningfully from early 2020 to December 2022 due to certain border control and other travel related restrictions as a result of the pandemic. Over the course of December 2022 and January 2023, Macau authorities eliminated these COVID-19 related protective measures and the gaming market resumed a period of growth. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, visitation to Macau in 2024 increased 23.8% and 512.7% and decreased 11.4% as compared to 2023, 2022, and 2019, respectively.\nWe believe that the Macau region hosts one of the world's largest concentrations of potential gaming and tourism customers. According to Macau Statistical Information, annual gaming revenues were $36.5 billion in 2019, before falling to $7.6 billion in 2020, $10.8 billion in 2021, and $5.3 billion in 2022, due to various quarantine measures and travel and entry restrictions and conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19, and increased to $22.7 billion in 2023 and $28.4 billion in 2024, respectively, due to Macau authorities eliminating COVID-19 related protective measures over the course of December 2022 and January 2023. We continue to believe that Macau's stated goal of becoming a world-class tourism destination will continue to drive additional visitation to the market and create future opportunities for us to invest and grow.\nOur Macau Operations face competition primarily from the 28 other casinos located throughout Macau in addition to casinos located throughout the world, including Singapore, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Australia, Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia. Additionally, certain other\nAsian countries and regions have legalized or in the future may legalize gaming, such as Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, which could increase competition for our Macau Operations.\nLas Vegas is the largest gaming market in the United States. The Las Vegas gaming market is highly competitive and is largely dependent on tourist arrivals and meeting- and convention-related visitation. According to statistics published by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, Las Vegas Strip total gaming win was $8.8 billion in 2024, a 1.0% decrease from $8.9 billion in 2023. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, overall Las Vegas visitor volume was 41.7 million in 2024, a 2.1% increase from 40.8 million in 2023. Occupancy on the Las Vegas Strip was relatively flat at 86.4%, compared to 86.2% in 2023.\nOur Las Vegas Operations are located on the Las Vegas Strip and compete with other high-quality resorts and hotel casinos in Las Vegas. There are several recently completed large-scale integrated resort projects in the vicinity of our Las Vegas Operations, which may present increased competition in the future. Our Las Vegas Operations also compete, to some extent, with other casino resorts throughout the United States and elsewhere in the world.\nMassachusetts and its neighboring states of Connecticut and Rhode Island are host to a large, established casino market. The greater Boston metropolitan area is the largest population center in New England, with a population of approximately 5 million residents.\nGaming in the New England region is characterized by a high degree of competition, based largely on location, product quality, service levels, and effectiveness in marketing to and establishing relationships with repeat visitors located in the area. Encore Boston Harbor competes with both commercial and Native American casinos located in the northeastern United States, including two Native American casinos in Connecticut, two casinos in Rhode Island, and MGM Springfield in Massachusetts. Differences in regulatory landscapes across state borders may impact our ability to compete with other casinos in the region. For example, some casino operators in the region may pay lower gaming taxes, or may be permitted to offer gaming amenities we are currently unable to offer at Encore Boston Harbor. We also face competition, to a lesser degree, from operations in the region which offer other forms of legalized gaming and related recreation and leisure facilities, such as state lotteries, horse racing, online gaming, and sports betting.\nRegulation and Licensing\nOn December 16, 2022, Wynn Macau SA, an indirect subsidiary of the Company, entered into a definitive gaming concession contract (the \"Gaming Concession Contract\") with the Macau government, pursuant to which Wynn Macau SA was granted a 10-year gaming concession commencing on January 1, 2023 and expiring on December 31, 2032, to operate games of chance at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau.\nAs a casino concessionaire, Wynn Macau SA is subject to the regulatory control of the Macau government. The Macau government has adopted Laws and Administrative Regulations governing the operation of casinos in Macau. Only concessionaires are permitted to operate casinos. Each concessionaire was required to enter into a concession agreement with the Macau government which, together with the Laws and Administrative Regulations, form the framework for the regulation of the activities of the concessionaire.\nUnder the Laws and Administrative Regulations, concessionaires are subject to suitability requirements relating to background, associations and reputation, as are stockholders of 5% or more of a concessionaire's equity securities, officers, directors and key employees. The same requirements apply to any entity engaged by a concessionaire to manage casino operations. Concessionaires are required to satisfy minimum capitalization requirements, demonstrate and maintain adequate financial capacity to operate the concession and submit to continuous monitoring of their casino operations by the Macau government. Concessionaires also are subject to periodic financial reporting requirements and reporting obligations with respect to, among other things, certain contracts, financing activities and transactions with directors, financiers and key employees.\nTransfers or the encumbering of interests in concessionaires must be reported to the Macau government and are ineffective without government approval.\nEach concessionaire is required to engage a managing director who must be a permanent resident of Macau and the holder of at least 15% of the capital stock of the concessionaire. The appointment of the managing director and of any successor is ineffective without the approval of the Macau government. All contracts placing the management of a concessionaire's casino operations with a third party also are ineffective without the approval of the Macau government.\nConcessionaires are subject to a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenue, and must also make an annual contribution of up to 5% of gross gaming revenue for the promotion of public interests, social security, infrastructure and tourism. Concessionaires are obligated to withhold applicable taxes, according to the rate in effect as set by the government, from any commissions paid to gaming promoters. The withholding rate may be adjusted from time to time.\nThe Gaming Concession Contract between Wynn Macau SA and the Macau government requires Wynn Macau SA to operate two casinos: \"Casino Wynn Macau\" and \"Casino Wynn Palace.\"\nUnder the Gaming Concession Contract, Wynn Macau SA provided a first demand bank guarantee of MOP1.0 billion (approximately $125.1 million) in favor of the Macau government to support Wynn Macau SA’s legal and contractual obligations, from January 1, 2023 until one hundred and eighty days after the term of the Gaming Concession Contract expires or the rescission of the concession.\nPursuant to the Gaming Concession Contract and the Laws and Administrative Regulations, the Macau government may rescind the gaming concession if Wynn Macau SA fails to fulfill its obligations, including in the circumstances of (i) endangerment to the national security of mainland China or Macau, (ii) failure on the part of Wynn Macau SA to perform its obligations under the Gaming Concession Contract, (iii) public interest, and (iv) Wynn Macau SA ceasing to be eligible for the gaming concession under the Macau gaming law. If the Macau government rescinds the Gaming Concession Contract due to Wynn Macau SA’s non-fulfilment, or perceived non-fulfillment, of its obligati",
  "item7_clean": "NM - Not meaningful.\nThe increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to increased operating costs associated with higher business volumes at our properties, partially offset by decreased operating expenses related to Wynn Interactive following the closure of Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming business.\nCasino expenses increased $194.4 million and $133.4 million at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, respectively. These increases resulted from higher operating costs, including increases of $166.5 million and $114.7 million in incremental gaming tax expense at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, respectively, driven by the increase in casino revenues.\nRoom expenses increased $18.2 million at our Las Vegas Operations as a result of higher payroll and other operating costs.\nFood and beverage expenses increased $19.2 million and $16.2 million at our Las Vegas Operations and our Macau Operations, respectively, as a result of higher payroll and other operating costs.\nEntertainment, retail and other expenses decreased $112.6 million at Corporate and other as a result of decreased operating costs related to Wynn Interactive. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $26.7 million at our Las Vegas Operations primarily due to increased costs from entertainment venue related revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $33.7 million at Encore Boston Harbor as result of certain furniture, fixtures and equipment assets being fully depreciated five years after the opening of the property in June of 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized impairment of goodwill and other finite-lived intangible assets of $72.1 million and $22.4 million, respectively, as a result of our decision to close Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming business.\nProperty charges and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted primarily of $130.0 million of forfeitures pursuant to a non-prosecution agreement and the Company's $9.4 million contribution towards a legal settlement, both of which are described in Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 18, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\" Property charges and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 also included $20.7 million of asset abandonments at our Macau Operations, $61.5 million of expensed project costs related to a discontinued development project at Corporate and other, $16.9 million of contract termination and other costs related to Wynn Interactive and a gain of $24.6 million related to the sale of certain Wynn Interactive assets.\nProperty charges and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of contract termination and other expenses of $94.6 million, as a result of our decision to close Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming business. Property charges and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 also included other contract terminations of $8.7 million at Wynn Macau and asset abandonments of $12.7 million and $8.0 million at Wynn Palace and our Las Vegas Operations, respectively.\nOther non-operating income and expenses\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased $63.1 million primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average debt balance, from $12.38 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, to $11.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, we capitalized interest of $23.0 million and $5.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe recorded interest income of $130.3 million and $175.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents held at financial institutions.\nWe incurred a foreign currency remeasurement gain of $29.2 million and a loss of $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impact of the exchange rate fluctuation of the Macau pataca, in relation to the U.S. dollar, on the remeasurements of U.S. dollar denominated debt and other obligations from our Macau-related entities drove the variability between periods.\nWe recorded a gain of $42.5 million and $45.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to the change in derivative fair value of the conversion feature of the WML Convertible Bonds.\nWe recorded a $2.9 million loss on debt financing transactions for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily related to the issuance of the 2031 Add-On WRF Senior Notes, 2033 WRF Senior Notes, and the repurchase of the 2025 WLV Senior Notes. We recorded a $12.7 million loss on debt financing transactions for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to the issuance of the 2031 WRF Senior Notes and the repurchase of the tendered 2025 WRF Senior Notes.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of $3.7 million and a benefit of $496.8 million, respectively. The 2024 income tax expense primarily relates to U.S. profitability as well as an increase in non-deductible expenses offset by the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. The 2023 income tax benefit primarily relates to the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.\nIn 2024, Wynn Macau SA received an exemption from Macau’s 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2027. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau special gaming tax and other levies in accordance with our concession agreement.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $138.6 million and $52.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interests' share of net income from WML.\nAs further described in Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 20, \"Segment Information,\" we use Adjusted Property EBITDAR to manage the operating results of our segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening expenses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, property charges and other expenses, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other expenses (including intercompany golf course, meeting and convention, and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, change in derivatives fair value, loss on debt financing transactions, and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for\nvaluation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDAR as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. We also present Adjusted Property EBITDAR because it is used by some investors to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDAR as a supplement to GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDAR calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted Property EBITDAR does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDAR. Also, our calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\nThe following table summarizes Adjusted Property EBITDAR (in thousands) for Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau, Las Vegas Operations, Encore Boston Harbor, and Corporate and other as reviewed by management and summarized in Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 20, \"Segment Information.\" That footnote also presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR to net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited.\nYear Ended December 31,\nIncrease/ (Decrease)\nLas Vegas Operations\nEncore Boston Harbor\nAdjusted Property EBITDAR at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau increased $117.9 million and $103.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in operating revenues of $330.8 million and $251.1 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.\nAdjusted Property EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Operations remained relatively consistent in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAdjusted Property EBITDAR at Encore Boston Harbor decreased $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in operating revenues of $8.6 million.\nAdjusted Property EBITDAR at Corporate and other increased $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in marketing and promotional expenses related to Wynn Interactive following our decision, announced in August 2023, to close Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming business.\nRefer to the discussions above regarding the specific details of our results of operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAmounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and SOFR or HIBOR rates as of December 31, 2024. Actual rates will vary.\nRepresents the fixed and minimum variable gaming premium amounts payable under the Gaming Concession Contract, based on the number and type of gaming tables and machines we operate.\nRepresents amounts payable under the Property Transfer Agreements (as defined in Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 5, \"Property and Equipment, net\").\nRepresents payments to executive officers, other members of management and certain key employees. Employment agreements generally have three to five year terms and typically indicate a base salary and often contain provisions for discretionary bonuses. Certain of the executives are also entitled to a separation payment if terminated without \"cause\" or upon voluntary termination of employment for \"good reason\" following a \"change of control\" (as these terms are defined in the employment contracts).\nRepresents payments to certain communities surrounding Encore Boston Harbor, required as a condition of the gaming license awarded to Wynn MA, LLC.\nOther includes open purchase orders, future charitable contributions, performance contracts and other contracts. As further discussed in Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" we had $131.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign the related potential tax obligations to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2024.\nGaming Concession Contract\nIn December 2022, Wynn Macau SA entered into a definitive gaming concession contract (the \"Gaming Concession Contract\") with the government of Macau, pursuant to which Wynn Macau SA was granted a 10-year gaming concession commencing on January 1, 2023 and expiring on December 31, 2032, to operate games of chance at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau.\nIn addition to the Macau gaming premium and Property Transfer Agreements payment commitments included in the table above, Wynn Macau SA committed to make certain non-gaming and gaming investments in the amount of MOP21.03 billion (approximately $2.63 billion) over the course of the ten-year term of the Gaming Concession Contract. MOP19.80 billion (approximately $2.48 billion) of the committed investment will be used for non-gaming capital projects and event programming in connection with, among others, attraction of foreign tourists, conventions and exhibitions, entertainment performances, sports events, culture and art, health and wellness, themed amusement, gastronomy, community tourism and maritime tourism.\nAdditionally, Wynn Macau SA committed to make the following payments throughout the term of the Gaming Concession Contract:\n(i) Special gaming premium - Wynn Macau SA is obligated to pay a special annual gaming premium if the average of the gross gaming revenues of the Company's gaming tables and gaming machines is lower than a certain minimum amount determined by the Macau government. A minimum average annual gross gaming revenue of MOP7.0 million (approximately\n$0.9 million) per gaming table and MOP300,000 (approximately $38 thousand) per gaming machine has been set by Macau government. If Wynn Macau SA fails to reach such minimum gross gaming revenue, Wynn Macau SA will be required to pay a special premium equal to the difference between the special gaming tax calculated based on the actual gross gaming revenue and that of such minimum gross gaming revenue. No special gaming premium was paid for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023;\n(ii) Special levies, totaling 5% of gross gaming revenues. The Macau government may reduce the special levies payable by Wynn Macau SA (1) based on Wynn Macau SA’s contribution to the attraction of tourists who enter Macau for tourism and business purposes and hold travel documents issued by countries or regions other than the People’s Republic of China; (2) if Wynn Macau SA’s operations are adversely affected by abnormal, unpredictable or force majeure circumstances associated with the prevailing economic conditions of Macau; or (3) factors as determined by the Chief Executive of Macau; and\n(iii) Special gaming tax assessed at the rate of 35% of gross gaming revenues.\nSee Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 18, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" for additional information regarding the amounts owed under the Gaming Concession Contract and Macau Gaming Law.\nWynn Al Marjan Island Funding Commitment\nWe estimate our remaining 40% pro-rata share of the required equity for the construction of Wynn Al Marjan Island integrated resort is between $700 million and $775 million inclusive of capitalized interest, fees, and certain improvements on the Island. Wynn Al Marjan Island is currently expected to open in 2027.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates and on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information availabl",
