Business (Continued)\nOVERVIEW\nBelow is a description of our reportable segments and other activities as of December 31, 2024.\nFORD BLUE SEGMENT\nFord Blue primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln internal combustion engine (“ICE”) and hybrid vehicles, service parts, accessories, and digital services for retail customers, together with the associated costs of development, manufacture, and distribution of the vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. This segment focuses on developing Ford and Lincoln ICE and hybrid vehicles. Additionally, this segment provides hardware engineering and manufacturing capabilities to Ford Model e and manufactures vehicles on behalf of Ford Pro and, in certain cases, Ford Model e. Ford Blue also includes:\nAll sales for markets not presently in scope for Ford Model e or Ford Pro (as further described below)\nIn markets outside of the United States and Canada, sales to commercial, government, and rental customers of ICE and hybrid vehicles not considered core to Ford Pro\nSales of EVs by our unconsolidated affiliates in China\nAll sales of vehicles manufactured and sold to other OEMs\nFORD MODEL E SEGMENT\nFord Model e primarily includes the sale of our electric vehicles, service parts, accessories, and digital services for retail customers, together with the associated costs of development, manufacture, and distribution of the vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. This segment focuses on developing EV and digital vehicle technologies, as well as software development. Additionally, Ford Model e provides software and connected vehicle technologies on behalf of the enterprise, and manufactures certain EVs, including for Ford Pro. Ford Model e operates in North America, Europe, and China. Ford Model e also includes EV and related sales not considered core to Ford Pro to commercial, government, and rental customers in Europe, China, and Mexico.\nFORD PRO SEGMENT\nFord Pro primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles, service parts, accessories, and services for commercial, government, and rental customers. Included in this segment are sales of all core Ford Pro vehicles, such as Super Duty and the Transit range of vans in North America and Europe and all sales of Ranger in Europe. In the United States and Canada, Ford Pro also includes all vehicle sales to commercial, government, and rental customers. This segment focuses on selling ICE, hybrid, and electric vehicles, and providing digital and physical services to optimize and maintain fleets, including telematics and EV charging solutions. This segment reflects external sales of vehicles produced by Ford Blue and Ford Model e and the costs (including intersegment markup) associated with acquiring vehicles for sale and providing services. Ford Pro operates in North America and Europe.\nOur vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln. In 2024, we sold approximately 4,470,000 vehicles at wholesale throughout the world. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“Item 7”) for a discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volumes.\nSubstantially all of our vehicles, parts, and accessories are sold through distributors and dealers (collectively, “dealerships”), the substantial majority of which are independently owned. At December 31, the approximate number of dealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands was as follows:\nFord-Lincoln (combined)\nWe do not depend on any single customer or a few customers to the extent that the loss of such customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\nIn addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale, we also sell vehicles to our dealerships for sale to fleet customers, including commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments. We also sell parts and accessories, primarily to our dealerships (which, in turn, sell these products to retail customers) and to authorized parts distributors (which, in turn, primarily sell these products to retailers). We also offer extended service contracts.\nThe worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic and political conditions over which we have little control. Vehicles are durable goods, and consumers and businesses have latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing vehicle. The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth, geopolitical events, and other factors (including the cost of purchasing and operating cars, trucks, and utility vehicles, the availability and cost of financing, cost of fuel, and electric vehicle charging availability and cost). As a result, the number of cars, trucks, and utility vehicles sold may vary substantially from year to year. Further, the automotive industry is a highly competitive business that has a wide and growing variety of product and service offerings from a growing number of manufacturers.\nOur wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand. Our wholesale unit volumes also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory, and our ability to maintain sufficient production levels to support desired dealer inventory in the event of supplier disruptions or other types of disruptions affecting our production. Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived by customers in comparison to those offered by other manufacturers based on many factors, including price, quality, styling, reliability, safety, fuel efficiency, functionality, sustainability, and reputation. Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions. Our ability to satisfy changing consumer and business preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle, as well as design and performance characteristics and the services our vehicles offer, affects our sales and earnings significantly.\nAs with other manufacturers, the profitability of our business is affected by many factors, including:\nWholesale unit volumes\nMargin of profit on each vehicle sold - which, in turn, is affected by many factors, such as:\nMarket factors - volume and mix of vehicles and options sold, and net pricing (reflecting, among other factors, incentive programs)\nCosts of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles\nCosts for customer warranty claims and additional service actions\nCosts for safety, emissions, and fuel economy technology and equipment\nA high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can significantly affect overall profitability\nAlthough supply disruptions have resulted in a higher level of new vehicle prices, our industry has historically had a very competitive pricing environment, driven in part by excess capacity. For the past several decades, manufacturers typically have offered price discounts and other marketing incentives to provide value for customers and maintain market share and production levels, and we saw some of these actions resume as industry production and inventories improved in recent quarters. The decline in value of foreign currencies can also contribute significantly to competitive pressures in many of our markets.\nCompetitive Position.\nThe worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers, with no single dominant producer. Certain manufacturers, however, account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries, especially their countries of origin.\nWe manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors, including retail sales (i.e., units sold by our dealerships to their customers at retail) and dealer stock levels (i.e., the number of units held in inventory by our dealerships for sale to their customers). Historically, we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in the business, with production in many markets tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer (typically the strongest sales months of the year); however, that may not be the case in a particular year depending on the circumstances, e.g., if we have a higher number of vehicle launches (particularly for our higher volume vehicles) in the first half of the year, we would expect production in the second half of the year to be higher.\nItem 1. Business (Continued)\nWe purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in the production of, and development of technologies in, our vehicles. These materials include base metals (e.g., steel and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene). As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles, we expect to increase our reliance on lithium, cobalt, and nickel, among other materials, for batteries. We expect to have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs; however, there always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact availability in sufficient quantities and at cost effective prices to meet our needs.
