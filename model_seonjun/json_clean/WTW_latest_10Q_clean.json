See ‘Disclaimer Regarding Forward-looking Statements’ for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in those statements.\nThis discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the SEC. We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company’s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under U.S. GAAP, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future.\nSee ‘Non-GAAP Financial Measures’ below for further discussion of our adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures.\nImpact of Market Conditions on Our Business\nTypically, our business benefits from regulatory change, political risk or economic uncertainty. Insurance broking generally tracks the economy, but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change.\nWithin our insurance and brokerage business, due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenue may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating margin. A ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our revenue and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography, industry and client segment. As a result, and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates in the aggregate. Overall, at the time of filing this Quarterly Report, we are seeing a softening market.\nMarket conditions in the broking industry in which we operate are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the various geographical economies which we serve around the world, insurance rate movements, and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients.\nThe markets for our consulting, technology and solutions, and marketplace services are affected by economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. We believe that the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting company include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs. In that regard, we are focused on developing and implementing technology, data and analytic solutions for both internal operations and for maintaining industry standards and meeting client preferences. We have made such investments from time to time and may decide, based on perceived business needs, to make investments in the future that may be different from past practice or our current expectations.\nWith regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the role of health care coverage in recruiting/retaining employees and transitioning employees to retirement, the availability of price competitive individual insurance policies, the array of coverage choices available through the exchange provider and its ability to deliver measurable cost savings for corporate clients, and to both execute efficiently and deliver high quality service. Since the individual insurance market for Medicare policies is well-established and a significant portion of corporate employers have already implemented an exchange for their Medicare retirees, growth in this population segment will be derived from public employers and educational and other not-for-profit institutions. This growth may be more episodic in nature. Growth in other population segments is likely to remain low unless a more competitive individual insurance market emerges for these segments.\nRisks and Uncertainties of the Economic Environment\n\nR&B segment revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $1.0 billion and $940 million, respectively. Corporate Risk & Broking's organic revenue growth was primarily driven by new business and revenue recognized from project-based placements within the global specialty businesses, offsetting the negative impact of insurance rate headwinds. Insurance Consulting and Technology revenue was flat for the quarter as clients continued to manage spending more cautiously amid ongoing economic uncertainty.\nR&B segment operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $189 million and $170 million, respectively. R&B segment operating income increased due primarily to operating leverage driven by strong organic revenue growth and Transformation program savings, which were partially offset by headwinds from decreased interest income and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nImpairment for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.0 billion. Impairment was attributable to the goodwill impairment associated with our Benefits, Delivery and Administration (‘BDA’) reporting unit related to the sale of our TRANZACT business.\nDepreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $56 million, compared to $60 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $4 million or 7%. Depreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $167 million, compared to $176 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $9 million or 5%. These decreases were primarily due to a lower depreciable base of assets resulting from disposals associated with the Company’s Transformation program that concluded in the fourth quarter of 2024 and a lower dollar value of assets placed in service during the past few years.\nAmortization for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $47 million, compared to $56 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $9 million or 16%. Amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $144 million, compared to $176 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $32 million or 18%. These decreases were due in part to the disposal of intangible assets associated with the sale of our TRANZACT business. Our intangible amortization is generally more heavily weighted to the initial years of the useful lives of the related intangibles, and therefore amortization related to intangible assets has decreased and will continue to decrease over time.\n\nIncome from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $1.2 billion, compared to a loss of $274 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.5 billion. This increase resulted primarily from the current-year absence of impairment expense associated with the prior-year sale of our TRANZACT business, lower transformation and transaction costs due to the completion of our Transformation program during the fourth quarter of 2024, lower marketing expenses and decreased office and technology expenses in the current year, partially offset by lower revenue due to the prior-year sale of our TRANZACT business.\nInterest expense for both the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $65 million. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $194 million as compared to $197 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $3 million or 2%. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a lower average level of indebtedness in the current year.\nOther Income/(Loss), Net\nOther income/(loss), net for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was income of $37 million, compared to a loss of $1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.2 billion. Other income/(loss), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was a loss of $18 million, compared to a loss of $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.1 billion. These increases were primarily due to gains on disposals of operations in the current year, as compared to the\n\nNet Income/(Loss) Attributable to WTW\nNet income attributable to WTW for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $304 million, compared to a net loss of $1.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.0 billion. This increase resulted primarily from the current-year absence of loss on disposal and impairment expense associated with the sale of our TRANZACT business in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher tax expense due to prior-year tax benefits attributable to the losses associated with the sale.\nNet income attributable to WTW for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $870 million, compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.2 billion. This increase resulted primarily from the current-year absence of loss on disposal and impairment expense associated with the sale of our TRANZACT business in the prior-year period, lower transformation and transaction costs due to the completion of our Transformation program during the fourth quarter of 2024, and lower marketing expenses for the curre"
