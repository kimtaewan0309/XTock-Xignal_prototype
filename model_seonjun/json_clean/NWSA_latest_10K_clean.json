  "item1_clean": "The Dow Jones segment’s businesses compete with a wide range of media and information businesses, including digital media, print publications and information services.\nThe Dow Jones segment’s consumer products, including its digital publications, newspapers, magazines, podcasts and video, compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and app-based media, news aggregators, customized news feeds, search engines, blogs, magazines, investment tools, social media sources, podcasts and event producers, as well as other media such as television, radio stations and outdoor displays. Competition for subscriptions and\ncirculation is based on news and editorial content, data and analytics content in research tools, subscription pricing, the usefulness and popularity of its digital products, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. Competition for advertising is based upon advertisers’ judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors, including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates, advertising effectiveness and brand strength and reputation. As a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies (including developments in AI, particularly generative AI), distribution platforms and business models, and corresponding changes in consumer behavior, the consumer-focused businesses within the Dow Jones segment continue to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue, including from a variety of alternative news and information sources, programmatic advertising buying channels and AI aggregators and other emerging technology platforms. Shifts in consumer behavior require the Company to continually innovate and improve upon its own products, services and platforms in order to remain competitive. The Company believes that these changes will continue to pose opportunities and challenges, and that it is well positioned to leverage its global reach, brand recognition and proprietary technology to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these changes.\nThe Dow Jones segment’s professional information products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers, global financial newswires and energy and commodities pricing and data providers, including Reuters News, RELX (including LexisNexis and ICIS), Refinitiv, S&P Global, DTN and Argus Media, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data.

For the year ended June 30, 2025, average monthly visits to realestate.com.au were 132.2 million, with 12.1 million people visiting each month on average, according to Ipsos iris data. Australians visited realestate.com.au 4.0 times more on average than the nearest competitor during the year ended June 30, 2025. Realcommercial.com.au had 1.9 million people visit each month on average for the year ended June 30, 2025, 3.0 times more than the nearest competitor, based on Ipsos iris data.\nREA Group’s other Australian property and property-related advertising and services include media display advertising and data services for markets adjacent to property.\nRealestate.com.au and realcommercial.com.au derive the majority of their revenue from their core property advertising listing products and monthly advertising subscriptions from real estate agents and property developers. Realestate.com.au and realcommercial.com.au offer a product hierarchy which enables real estate agents and property developers to upgrade listing advertisements to increase their prominence on the site, as well as a variety of targeted products, including media display advertising products. Flatmates.com.au derives the majority of its revenue from advertising listing products and membership fees. The media business offers unique advertising opportunities on REA Group’s websites to property developers and other relevant markets, including utilities and telecommunications, insurance, finance, automotive and retail. REA Group also provides residential property data services to the financial sector through its PropTrack data services business, primarily on a monthly subscription basis.\nREA Group’s international operations consist primarily of its 78.0% interest in REA India, a leading digital real estate services provider in India (News Corp holds a 22.0% interest in REA India). REA Group’s other assets include a 20% interest in Move, as referenced above. REA Group’s businesses outside Australia derive the majority of their revenue from their property advertising listing products and monthly advertising subscriptions from real estate agents and property developers.\nREA Group’s financial services business encompasses a digital property search and financing experience and mortgage broking services under its Mortgage Choice brand. REA Group has continued to execute on its financial services strategy by improving broker productivity and increasing penetration of Mortgage Choice white label products, supported by REA Group’s partnership with digital lender Athena Home Loans. The financial services business generates revenue primarily through commissions from lenders.\nMove is a leading provider of digital real estate services in the U.S. Move primarily operates Realtor.com\n, a premier real estate information, advertising and services platform, under a perpetual agreement and trademark license with the National Association of Realtors\n(“NAR”). Through Realtor.com\n, consumers have access to approximately 151 million properties across the U.S., including an extensive collection of homes, properties and apartments listed and displayed for sale or for rent and a large database of “off-market” properties.

The success of these businesses depends on their ability to provide products and services that are useful for consumers, real estate, mortgage and other related services professionals, homebuilders and landlords and attractive to their advertisers, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information they provide and brand awareness and reputation. These businesses compete primarily with companies that provide real-estate focused technology, products and services in their respective geographic markets, including other real estate and property websites and apps in Australia, the U.S. and India.\nThe Company’s Book Publishing segment consists of HarperCollins, the second largest consumer book publisher in the world based on global revenue, with operations in 15 countries.

  "item7_clean": "—Revenues increased $200 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. The increase\ndue to higher revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment driven by higher Australian residential revenues at REA Group, at the Dow Jones segment driven by higher circulation and subscription revenues and at the Book Publishing segment driven by higher digital book sales and improved returns in the U.S., partially offset by lower revenues at the News Media segment driven by the transfer of third-party printing revenue contracts to News UK’s joint venture with DMG Media in fiscal 2024, lower advertising revenues and lower circulation and subscription revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.\nThe Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period.\n—Operating expenses decreased $78 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. The decrease in operating expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was primarily due to lower expenses at the News Media segment driven by cost savings from the combination of News UK’s printing operations with those of DMG Media and other cost savings initiatives. The decrease was partially offset by increased expenses at the Dow Jones segment driven by higher employee costs. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in an Operating expense increase of $9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.\nSelling, general and administrative\n—Selling, general and administrative increased $104 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. The increase in Selling,\ngeneral and administrative for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025\nwas primarily due to higher expenses at the Digital Real Estate Services segment driven by higher employee costs at REA Group, $12 million of costs related to REA Group’s withdrawn offer to acquire Rightmove and higher costs from REA India, at the Book Publishing segment due to higher employee costs and costs from recent acquisitions and at the Dow Jones segment driven by higher marketing and technology costs.\nDepreciation and amortization\n—Depreciation and amortization expense increased $19 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. The increase was driven by higher depreciation of capitalized software costs, primarily at the Digital Real Estate Services and News Media segments.\nImpairment and restructuring charges\n—During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $120 million and $89 million, respectively. See Note 5—Restructuring Programs in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $44 million, primarily related to the write-down of fixed assets at the News Media segment associated with the combination of News UK’s printing operations with those of DMG Media. See Note 7—Property, Plant and Equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEquity losses of affiliates\n—Equity losses of affiliates worsened by $9 million, or 150%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. See Note 6—Investments in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest income (expense), net\n—Interest income (expense), net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 improved by $21 million as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily driven by lower borrowings at REA Group and higher interest income on cash balances. See Note 9—Borrowings and Note 11—Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n—For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company recorded Other, net of $111 million, which was mainly comprised of REA Group’s gain recognized on the sale of its interest in PropertyGuru. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded Other, net of $(59) million. See Note 21—Additional Financial Information in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations\n—For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company recorded income tax expense of $275 million on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $923 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30%, which was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses offset by lower taxes on the disposition of REA Group’s interest in PropertyGuru.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of $206 million on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $585 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 35%, which was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates, asset impairments and investment write-downs with lower tax benefits and valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses. See Note 19—Income Taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn July 4, 2025, H.R. 1 - One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted into law. The OBBBA makes permanent key elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), including 100% bonus depreciation, domestic research cost expensing, and the business interest expense limitation. Certain provisions of OBBBA will become effective for the Company’s 2026 fiscal year, while others will take effect beginning in fiscal 2027. ASC 740,\n, requires the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. Consequently, the Company will evaluate all U.S. deferred tax balances and any other impacts to its financial statements as a result of the OBBBA in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of reported profits (“Pillar 2”) that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. Since the proposal, many countries, including the UK and Australia, incorporated Pillar 2 model rule concepts into their domestic laws. Although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar 2 slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar 2. Following an executive order issued by the United States in January 2025 announcing opposition to aspects of these rules, the G7 issued a statement on June 28, 2025 acknowledging that U.S. parented groups would be exempt from certain aspects of Pillar 2 in recognition of existing U.S. minimum tax rules to which they are subject. The statement acknowledges that these issues have relevance to the wider group of countries in the OECD Inclusive Framework with a view to reaching an acceptable solution for all.\nWhile these rules are not currently expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, their application continues to evolve, and the outcome may alter aspects of how the Company’s tax obligations are determined in countries in which it does business. In addition, while several jurisdictions have rolled back their digital services taxes, certain jurisdictions continue to maintain, or have enacted new digital services taxes. Those taxes have had limited impact on the Company’s overall tax obligations, but the Company continues to monitor them.\nNet income from continuing operations\n—Net income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was $648 million as compared to $379 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $269 million, or 71%, as compared to fiscal 2024, driven by the factors discussed above.\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n—Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was $692 million compared to $(25) million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The amounts recognized in both fiscal years relate to the reclassification of Foxtel to discontinued operations. See Note 3—Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n—Net income was $1,340 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, as compared to $354 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $986 million, or 279%, primarily driven by the factors discussed above.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations\n—Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations was $168 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, as compared to $110 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $58 million, or 53%, primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of the PropertyGuru investment and higher earnings at REA Group.\nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. Segment EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources within, the Company’s businesses. Segment EBITDA is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest (expense) income, net, other, net, income tax (expense) benefit and net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the Company’s business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).\nTotal Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss) from continuing operations, cash flow from continuing operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. The Company believes that the presentation of Total Segment EBITDA provides useful information regarding the Company’s operations and other factors that affect the Company’s reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are not representative of its core business. As a result, users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the Company across different periods.\nThe following table reconciles Net income from continuing operations to Total Segment EBITDA for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024:\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\nNet income from continuing operations\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations\nInterest (income) expense, net\nEquity losses of affiliates\nImpairment and restructuring charges\nDepreciation and amortization\nTotal Segment EBITDA\n\nCirculation and subscription revenues increased $9 million, or 2%, due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations as cover price increases, higher content licensing revenues and digital subscriber growth were more than offset by print volume declines. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $22 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCurrent Financial Condition\nThe Company’s principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of June 30, 2025, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were $2.4 billion. The Company also has available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) and certain other facilities, as described below, and expects to have access to the worldwide credit and capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue additional debt if needed or desired. The Company currently expects these elements of liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months, including repayment of indebtedness. Although the Company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the credit and capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for at least the next twelve months, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the financial and operational performance of the Company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (ii) the Company’s credit ratings and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (iii) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents; (iv) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets; and (v) the state of the economy. There can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company’s consolidated assets included $915 million in cash and cash equivalents that were held by its foreign subsidiaries. Of this amount, $280 million is cash not readily accessible by the Company as it is held by REA Group, a majority owned but separately listed public company. REA Group must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group’s cash balance. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company’s undistributed foreign earnings were considered permanently reinvested and as such, United States federal and state income taxes were not previously recorded on these earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, substantially all of the Company’s earnings in foreign subsidiaries generated prior to the enactment of the Tax Act were deemed to have been repatriated and taxed accordingly. As of June 30, 2025, the Company has approximately $1 billion of undistributed foreign earnings generated after the Tax Act that it intends to reinvest permanently. It is not practicable to",
