BUSINESS\nWe are an international producer and marketer of beer, wine, and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy with powerful, consumer-connected, high-quality brands like Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Pacifico, Robert Mondavi Winery, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine Company, High West, Casa Noble, and Mi CAMPO. In the U.S., we are one of the top growth contributors at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers. We are also the second-largest beer company and have the #1 beer brand, Modelo Especial, in dollar sales in the U.S. We continued to strengthen our leadership position in the U.S. beer market as the #1 share gainer in the high-end beer segment and the overall U.S. beer market. Within wine and spirits, we have implemented a multi-year strategy to reposition this business to a portfolio of exclusively higher-end brands that we believe will generate higher growth and higher margins, aligned to our focus on consumer-led premiumization trends, and we continue to progressively expand our supply channels through DTC and international markets. The strength of our brands makes us a supplier of choice to many of our consumers and our customers, which include wholesale distributors, retailers, and on-premise locations. We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities.\nOur mission is to build brands that people love because we believe elevating human connections is Worth Reaching For. It is worth our dedication, hard work, and calculated risks to anticipate market trends and deliver more for our consumers, stockholders, employees, and industry. This dedication is what has driven us to become one of the fastest-growing, large CPG companies in the U.S. at retail.\nHeadquartered in Rochester, New York, we are a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1972, as the successor to a business founded in 1945.\nOur overall strategic vision is to consistently deliver industry-leading total stockholder returns over the long-term through a focus on these key pillars:\ncontinue building strong brands people love with advantaged routes to market;\nbuild a culture that is consumer-obsessed and leverages robust innovation capabilities to stay on the forefront of consumer trends;\ndeploy capital in line with disciplined and balanced priorities;\ndeliver on impactful ESG initiatives that we believe are not only good business, but also good for the world; and\nempower the whole enterprise to achieve best-in-class operational efficiency.\nWe will continue to strive for success by ensuring consumer-led decision making drives all aspects of our business; building a strong talent pipeline with best-in-class people development; investing in infrastructure that supports and enables our business, including data systems and architecture; and exemplifying intentional and proactive fiscal management. We place focus on positioning our portfolio on higher-margin, higher-growth categories of the beverage alcohol industry to align with our strategy to address consumer-led premiumization, product, and purchasing trends, which we anticipate will continue to drive faster relative growth rates across beer, wine, and spirits. To continue capitalizing on consumer-led premiumization trends, become more competitive, and grow our business, we have employed a strategy dedicated to organic growth and supplemented by targeted investments and acquisitions. We intend for our multi-year Digital Business Acceleration initiative to enable us to drive results by enhancing our technology capabilities in key areas. In Fiscal 2025, we focused on end-to-end digital supply chain planning, logistics, procurement, and revenue growth management. In Fiscal 2026, we plan to expand this initiative to include consumer insights and analytics. We believe our continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet provides a solid financial foundation to support our broader strategic initiatives. As a result of this strategy, we have realized impacts on each segment of our business.\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR\nI\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIn our beer business, we focus on upholding our leadership position in the U.S. beer market, including the high-end segment, and continuing to grow our high-end imported beer brands through maintenance of leading margins, enhancements to our results of operations and operating cash flow, and exploring new avenues for growth. In Fiscal 2026, we intend to increase distribution for key brands, optimize growth through differentiated brand positioning, price pack architecture, and market prioritization, as well as continue to invest in the next phase of modular capacity additions necessary to support our ongoing growth. We remain focused on consumer-led innovation by creating new line extensions behind celebrated, trusted brands and package formats, as well as new to world brands, that are intended to meet emerging needs.\nIn our wine and spirits business, we continue to focus on delivering growth and improving margins beyond Fiscal 2026 by driving our higher-end brands and operating efficiencies. We have reshaped our portfolio through a series of strategic acquisitions and divestitures to drive our enhanced (and following the anticipated completion of the 2025 Wine Divestitures Transaction, exclusive) focus on higher-end wine and spirits brands that we believe will generate higher growth and higher margins, aligned with our strategy to address consumer-led premiumization trends and meet the evolving needs of our consumers. We remain a key supplier in U.S. 3-tier brick-and-mortar distribution. In addition, we are advancing our aim to become a global, omni-channel competitor in line with consumer preferences as we continue our efforts to progressively expand into DTC channels (including hospitality), 3-tier eCommerce, and international markets.\nFor further information on our strategy, including factors that could impact our future results of operations and/or financial condition, see “Overview” within MD&A.\nDivestitures, acquisitions, and investments\nIn connection with executing our strategy as outlined above, during Fiscal 2025 we completed the following transactions:\nSale of the remaining assets at the canceled brewery construction project located in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico.\nWine and Spirits segment\nDivestiture of the SVEDKA brand and related assets, primarily including inventory and equipment; supported our focus on consumer-led premiumization trends and meeting the evolving needs of consumers.\nNelson’s Green Brier investment\nPurchase of the remaining 25% noncontrolling interest of Tennessee-based craft bourbon and whiskey products; supported our focus on consumer-led premiumization trends and meeting the evolving needs of consumers.\nSea Smoke acquisition\nAcquisition of a luxury wine brand and vineyards; supported our focus on consumer-led premiumization trends and meeting the evolving needs of consumers.\nCorporate Operations and Other segment\nCanopy Exchangeable Shares\nWe elected to convert our Canopy common shares into and exchange, in part, our 2023 Canopy Promissory Note for Exchangeable Shares.\nFor further information about our significant Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023 transactions, refer to (i) “Overview” within MD&A and (ii) Note 2.\nWe report our operating results in\nsegments: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, and (iii) Corporate Operations and Other. The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR\nI\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nallocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.\nWe report net sales in two reportable segments, as follows:\nTotal Wine and Spirits\nConsolidated Net Sales\nWe are the #1 brewer and seller of imported beer in the U.S. market. We are also the leader in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which includes the imported and ABA categories. We have the exclusive right to import, market, and sell our Mexican beer brands in all 50 states of the U.S., which include the following:\nCorona Non-Alcoholic\nModelo Spiked Aguas Frescas\nNotable achievements in the U.S. include the following: (i) we had 5 of the top 15 share gaining brands across the total beer category, (ii) Modelo Especial was the best-selling beer overall, (iii) Corona Extra was the second largest imported beer and fifth best-selling beer overall, and (iv) Pacifico and Victoria were the top two fastest growing major imported beer brands.\nDuring Fiscal 2025, we spent nearly $940 million on (i) planned expansions and execution of optimization initiatives and (ii) ongoing construction of the Veracruz Brewery. Expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities continue at our breweries in Mexico to support expected future business needs. We expect to spend approximately $2 billion over Fiscal 2026 through Fiscal 2028 largely on such activities. We believe these investments allow us the opportunity to further expand our leadership position in the high-end segment of the\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR\nI\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nU.S. beer market. For further information about our Mexico Beer Projects, refer to (i) “Production” below, (ii) MD&A, and (iii) Note 5.\nWe are also building on the success of our leading import brand families through our innovation strategy. For example, our Modelo Chelada brands have become an important contributor to our portfolio as the leading chelada in the U.S. beer market. In Fiscal 2025, we continued to build on our successful innovation platform with the launch of new products aligned with our focus on consumer-led premiumization, betterment, and flavor trends, including: (i) two additional pack sizes of Modelo Oro, a light and lower-calorie Mexican beer, to build on its launch in Fiscal 2024, (ii) Modelo Chelada Fresa Picante, a strawberry and chile pepper michelada-style beer, (iii) Modelo Chelada Negra con Chile, our first Modelo Negra chelada flavor launched in select markets, and (iv) Corona Sunbrew, a beer brewed with real citrus peels and a splash of real citrus juice, also launched in select markets. In Fiscal 2026, we launched Corona Sunbrew nationwide.\nWine and Spirits segment\nWe are a higher-end wine and spirits company in the U.S. market, with a portfolio that we believe will generate higher growth and higher margins. Our wine portfolio is supported by grapes purchased from independent growers, primarily in the U.S. and New Zealand, and vineyard holdings in the U.S., New Zealand, and Italy. Our wine and spirits are primarily marketed in the U.S. and also sold in Australia, Canada, Italy, New Zealand, and other major world markets.\nIn the U.S., we had 6\n\nof the 100 top-selling higher-end wine brands, with Kim Crawford achieving the 10\n. Some of our well-known wine and spirits brands and portfolio of brands include:\nWine Portfolio of Brands\nMy Favorite Neighbor\nNelson’s Green Brier\nRobert Mondavi Winery\nThe Prisoner Wine Company\nExcludes brands that are part of the 2025 Wine Divestitures Transaction, including Meiomi and SIMI, which each ranked in the 100 top-selling higher-end wine brands in the U.S.\nIn Fiscal 2025, the broader wine category continued to experience deceleration in both the U.S. wholesale and international markets, particularly in the lower price point segments of the category. As a result, we have been actively working to address these continued headwinds. The U.S. wholesale decline was partially offset by muted net sales growth in our international markets and DTC channel, which represented 16% of total Wine and Spirits net sales in Fiscal 2025. We continue to believe that beyond Fiscal 2026 our wine and spirits business will return to net sales growth supported by our continued efforts to better align our portfolio with our focus on broader consumer-led premiumization trends, expand our omni-channel capabilities, and extend into select international ma",
  "item7_clean": "our wine and spirits portfolio. The environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.\nWe remain committed to our long-term financial model of: growing sales, expanding margins, and increasing cash flow in order to continue to achieve comparable earnings per share growth as well as our target ratios for (i) comparable net leverage and (ii) dividend payout; investing to support the growth of our business; and delivering additional returns to stockholders through periodic share repurchases. Our results of operations and financial condition have been affected by an evolving consumer demand environment largely driven by what we believe to be non-structural socioeconomic factors. These factors include subdued spend, value-seeking behaviors, and reductions in the discretionary income available to purchase our products among consumers, elevated unemployment, changing prices, inflation, other unfavorable global and regional economic conditions, demographic trends in the U.S., global supply chain disruptions and constraints, and geopolitical events, as well as retailer destocking impacting our Wine and Spirits segment.\nRecent developments in international trade relations, including significant changes in U.S. trade policy and actions which include threatened, new, and increased tariffs on other countries and retaliatory tariffs and actions\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR\nI\nPART II\nITEM 7. MD&A\nimposed on certain U.S. goods have produced heightened uncertainty with respect to trade and tariff policies and regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, which could continue to alter the global trade environment. For example, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on product imports from certain countries (such as Mexico, the European Union including Italy, and New Zealand) and certain other countries have implemented tariffs on U.S. goods, such as the tariffs on certain product imports originating from the U.S. imposed by the Canadian government, although some of these tariffs were subsequently modified or delayed.\nWe expect some or all of these market conditions and their impacts to continue into Fiscal 2026 which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We intend to continue to monitor the evolving consumer demand and economic environments and their impacts on our business. In addition, we have implemented the 2025 Restructuring Initiative, which is an enterprise-wide cost savings and restructuring initiative designed to help optimize the performance of our business, including through enhanced organizational efficiency and optimized expenditures across our organization. We also intend to continue our commodity and foreign exchange hedging programs. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately respond to softer consumer demand trends or fully mitigate rising costs, including as a result of new or increased tariffs, through increased selling prices, cost savings, productivity, efficiency, and inventory management initiatives, optimized marketing plans, and/or our commodity and foreign exchange hedging programs. Furthermore, to the extent severe weather events that impact our business, such as wildfires, droughts, floods, extreme heat, and/or late frosts, or other weather conditions that constrain purchasing occasions for our consumers, continue to occur or accelerate in future periods, it could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\n2025 Wine Divestitures Transaction\nIn April 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to fully divest and, in certain instances, exclusively license the trademarks of a portion of our wine and spirits business, primarily centered around our remaining mainstream wine brands and associated inventory, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities for $900 million, subject to certain adjustments. The 2025 Wine Divestitures Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approval, and is expected to close immediately following the end of our first quarter of Fiscal 2026. We expect to use the net cash proceeds from the 2025 Wine Divestitures Transaction for general corporate purposes. This transaction supports our strategic focus on consumer-led premiumization trends and meeting the evolving needs of our consumers.\nThe 2025 Wine Divestitures Transaction largely resulted in both (i) $879.8 million of wine and spirits net assets being reclassified to held for sale as of February 28, 2025, and (ii) a $478.0 million assets held for sale impairment. The impairment loss was included in assets held for sale impairment within our consolidated results of operations for Fiscal 2025.\nFor additional information on this transaction, refer to Note 2.\nSelected financial information included in our results of operations for the portion of the Wine and Spirits business that we expect will no longer be part of our consolidated results is as follows:\n2025 Wine Divestitures Transaction\nIncluded in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations.\n2025 Restructuring Initiative\nWe have implemented the 2025 Restructuring Initiative which is expected to yield over $200 million in net annualized cost savings by Fiscal 2028. The majority of the work associated with the 2025 Restructuring Initiative is\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR\nI\nPART II\nITEM 7. MD&A\nexpected to be completed within Fiscal 2026 and is estimated to result in $80 million to $100 million of cumulative pre-tax costs once all phases are fully implemented. In connection with the 2025 Restructuring Initiative, we recognized $46.9 million of pre-tax employee termination costs and $2.8 million of pre-tax consulting services costs in Fiscal 2025 and we anticipate incurring an additional approximately $40 million of pre-tax consulting services, employee termination, and other costs during Fiscal 2026. The Fiscal 2025 costs were included in selling, general, and administrative costs within our consolidated results. For additional information on the 2025 Restructuring Initiative, see Note 2.\nDivestitures, Acquisitions, and Investments\nMexicali Brewery sale\nIn July 2024, we sold the remaining assets classified as held for sale at the canceled Mexicali Brewery.\nCraft Beer Divestitures\nIn June 2023, we completed the Craft Beer Divestitures. Accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of such craft beer brands through the dates of these divestitures. The Craft Beer Divestitures are consistent with our strategic focus on continuing to grow our high-end imported beer brands through maintenance of leading margins and enhancements to our results of operations.\nDaleville Facility sale\nIn May 2023, we sold the Daleville Facility in connection with our decision to exit the craft beer business.\nWine and Spirits segment\nOn January 6, 2025, we sold the SVEDKA brand and related assets, primarily including inventory and equipment. We received $409.2 million of cash proceeds, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which were used for general corporate purposes, including funding share repurchases, capital expenditures, and repayment of debt. Prior to the completion of the SVEDKA Divestiture, we recorded the results of operations of the SVEDKA brand in the Wine and Spirits segment. For Fiscal 2025, we recognized a $266.0 million net gain in connection with this divestiture which was included in gain (loss) on sale of business within our consolidated results.\nNelson’s Green Brier investment\nIn October 2024, we purchased the remaining 25% noncontrolling interest in Nelson’s Green Brier, a portfolio of Tennessee-based craft bourbon and whiskey products.\nSea Smoke acquisition\nIn June 2024, we acquired the Sea Smoke business, including a California-based luxury wine brand, vineyards, and a production facility. This transaction also included the acquisition of goodwill, inventory, and a trademark. The results of operations of Sea Smoke are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.\nThese Wine and Spirits segment activities support our strategic focus on consumer-led premiumization trends and meeting the evolving needs of our consumers.\nCorporate Operations and Other segment\nCorporate ventures investments\nAs of February 28, 2025, August 31, 2024, November 30, 2023, and August 31, 2023, we evaluated certain equity method investments and other securities measured at fair value, made through our corporate venture capital function, and determined there were other-than-temporary impairments due to business underperformance for the respective periods. These losses from impairment and on securities measured at fair value were included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results for the respective periods. In October 2023, we exited one of these equity method investments in exchange for a note receivable.\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR\nI\nPART II\nITEM 7. MD&A\nWe have an investment in Canopy, a North American cannabis and CPG company providing medical and adult-use cannabis products, which provides us an investment interest in a business in adjacent categories.\nExchangeable Shares —\nIn April 2024, we elected to convert our 17.1 million Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares on a one-for-one basis. Additionally, in April 2024, we exchanged C$81.2 million of the principal amount of our 2023 Canopy Promissory Note for 9.1 million Exchangeable Shares and forgave all accrued but unpaid interest together with the remaining principal amount of the note. As a result of these transactions, we (i) have 26.3 million Exchangeable Shares and (ii) recognized an $83.3 million net gain based on the fair value of Exchangeable Shares on the date of the conversion and exchange for Fiscal 2025.\nAdditionally, as of November 30, 2024, we evaluated the Exchangeable Shares for impairment primarily due to the business and industry factors that led to the decline in Canopy’s common share price since the date of conversion and exchange. We concluded that an impairment did exist and wrote down the Exchangeable Shares to their estimated fair value. Due to the continued decline in Canopy’s common share price, as of February 28, 2025, we evaluated the Exchangeable Shares for an additional impairment. We concluded an impairment did exist, and accordingly, the Exchangeable Shares were written down to their estimated fair value, resulting in a $76.1 million total impairment for Fiscal 2025.\nThe Exchangeable Share activity for Fiscal 2025 resulted in a total net gain of $7.2 million which was included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results.\nCanopy Equity Method Investment —\nWe evaluated our then-existing Canopy Equity Method Investment as of May 31, 2023, and determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment. Our conclusion was based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the fair value being less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding Canopy’s stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) Canopy recorded significant costs in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 results designed to align its Canadian cannabis operations and resources in response to continued unfavorable market trends, (iii) the substantial doubt about Canopy’s ability to continue as a going concern, as disclosed by Canopy, and (iv) Canopy’s identification of material misstatements in certain of its previously reported financial results related to sales in its BioSteel Sports Nutrition Inc. reporting unit that were accounted for incorrectly, including the recording of a goodwill impairment during its restated second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a result, the Canopy Equity Method Investment with a $266.2 million carrying value was written down to $142.7 million, its estimated fair value, resulting in a $123.5 million impairment. This loss from impairment was included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results for Fiscal 2024. We no longer apply the equity method to our investment in Canopy following the April 2024 conversion of our Canopy common shares to Exchangeable Shares.\nOther Canopy investments —\nIn April 2023, we extended the maturity of the remaining C$100.0 million principal amount of our then-existing Canopy Debt Securities by exchanging them for the 2023 Canopy Promissory Note. The fair value of the Canopy Debt Securities was $69.6 million as of February 28, 2023. As of May 31, 2023, we determined that the 2023 Canopy Promissory Note did not have future economic value and, accordingly, the fair value was reduced to zero.\nFor additional information on these divestitures, acquisitions, and investments, refer to Notes 2, 5, 7, and 10.\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR\nI\nPART II\nITEM 7. MD&A\nResults of Operations\nFinancial Highlights\nReferences to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of the SVEDKA Divestiture, as appropriate.\nFiscal 2025 compared to\nNet sales increased 2%\nlargely due to an increase in Beer net sales driven primarily by shipment volume growth and favorable impact from pricing, partially offset by a decline in organic Wine and Spirits net sales driven primarily by a decrease in branded shipment volume.\nOperating income decreased 89%\nlargely due to (i) the Fiscal 2025 wine and spirits goodwill and wine trademark assets impairments and (ii) an impairment of assets held for sale largely in connection with the 2025 Wine Divestitures Transaction, partially offset by (i) improvements within the Beer segment as the net sales growth and successful execution of cost savings initiatives outpaced higher marketing spend and (ii) a net gain related to the SVEDKA Divestiture.\nNet income (loss) attributable to CBI\n\nWine and Spirits, and (iii) Corporate Operations and Other.\nIn the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported beer brands and ABAs. We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to produce our Mexican beer portfolio and to import, market, and sell such portfolio in the U.S. In the Wine and Spirits segment,\nwe sell a portfolio that includes higher-end wine brands\ncomplemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of corporate communications, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate strategy\n, executive management, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, IT, legal, and public affairs,\nas well as our Canopy investment and investments made through our corporate venture capital function\n. All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are, therefore, not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our CODM’s evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments.\nThe business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.\nIn connection with continued negative trends within our Wine and Spirits business primarily attributable to our U.S. wholesale market, driven by declines in both the overall wine market and in our mainstream and premium wine brands, management updated its Fiscal 2025 outlook and latest financial projections for this reporting unit. Based on the aforementioned factors, we performed an interim quantitative assessment, as of August 31, 2024, and an annual quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment which resulted in a $2,740.7\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR\nI\nPART II\nITEM 7.
