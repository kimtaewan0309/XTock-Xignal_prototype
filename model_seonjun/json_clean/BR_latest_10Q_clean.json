These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements present the condensed consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and non-marketable securities. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding.\nThe results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year or any subsequent interim period. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 in the 2025 Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn presenting the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. In management’s opinion, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies” section of Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2025 Annual Report.\nKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nManagement focuses on a variety of key indicators to plan, measure and evaluate the Company’s business and financial performance. These performance indicators include Revenue and Recurring revenue as well as not generally accepted accounting principles measures (“Non-GAAP”) of Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, Free Cash flow, Recurring revenue growth constant currency, and Closed sales. In addition, management focuses on select operating metrics specific to Broadridge of Position Growth and Internal Trade Growth, as defined below.\nRefer to the section “Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, Free Cash flow and Recurring revenue growth constant currency to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, and an explanation for why these Non-GAAP metrics provide useful information to investors and how management uses these Non-GAAP metrics for operational and financial decision-making. Refer to the section “Results of Operations” for a description of Closed sales and an explanation of why Closed sales is a useful performance metric for management and investors.\nRevenues are primarily generated from fees for processing and distributing investor communications and fees for technology-enabled services and solutions. The Company monitors revenue in each of our two reportable segments as a key measure of success in addressing our clients’ needs. Revenues from fees are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. The level of recurring and event-driven activity the Company processes directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. Event-driven revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions the Company processes. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven revenues. Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as Broadridge Retirement and Workplace administrative services.\nRecurring revenue growth represents the Company’s total annual revenue growth, less growth from event-driven and distribution revenues. We distinguish recurring revenue growth between organic and acquired:\nOrganic – We define organic revenue as the recurring revenue generated from Net New Business and Internal Growth.\nAcquired – We define acquired revenue as the recurring revenue generated from acquired services in the first twelve months following the date of acquisition. This type of growth comes as a result of our strategy to purchase, integrate, and leverage the value of assets we acquire.\nPosition Growth and Internal Trade Growth\nThe Company uses select operating metrics specific to Broadridge of Position Growth and Internal Trade Growth in evaluating its business results and identifying trends affecting its business. Position Growth is comprised of “equity position growth” and “mutual fund/ETF position growth.” Equity position growth measures the estimated annual change in positions eligible for equity proxy materials. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company began presenting information on “equity revenue position growth.” Equity revenue position growth excludes small or fractional equity positions for which the Company does not recognize revenue (“non-revenue positions”). Prior period comparative information for this metric is not available. Mutual fund/ETF position growth measures the estimated change in mutual fund and exchange traded fund positions eligible for interim communications. These metrics are calculated from equity proxy and mutual fund/ETF position data reported to Broadridge for the same issuers or funds in both the current and prior year periods.\nInternal Trade Growth represents the estimated change in daily average trade volumes for Broadridge securities processing clients whose contracts are linked to trade volumes and who were on Broadridge’s trading platforms in both the current and prior year periods. Position Growth and Internal Trade Growth are useful non-financial metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates Broadridge’s ongoing operational performance within its Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations reportable segments, respectively.\nThe key performance indicators for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, are as follows:\nSelect Operating Metrics\nEquity revenue positions\nN/A\nMutual fund / ETF positions\nInternal Trade Growth\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussions of Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments refer to the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides a more detailed discussion concerning certain components of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe following references are utilized in the discussions of Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments:\n“Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property” and “Acquisition and Integration Costs” represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisition activities, respectively.\n“Restructuring and Other Related Costs” represent costs associated with the Company’s corporate restructuring initiative (the “Corporate Restructuring Initiative”) to exit and/or realign some of our businesses, streamline the Company’s management structure, reallocate work to lower cost locations, and reduce headcount in deprioritized areas, in addition to other restructuring activities.\n“Net New Business” refers to recurring revenue from Closed sales for the initial twelve-month contract period after which the client goes live with the Company’s service(s), less recurring revenue from client losses.\n“Internal Growth” is a component of recurring revenue and generally reflects year over year changes in existing services to our existing customers’ multi-year contracts beyond the initial twelve month period in which it was included in Net New Business.\n“Recurring revenue growth constant currency” refers to our Recurring revenue growth presented on a constant currency basis to exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations.\nThe following definitions describe the Company’s Revenues:\nRevenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity, in addition to distribution revenues. The level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. The types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are:\nMutual Fund Proxy: The proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restr"
