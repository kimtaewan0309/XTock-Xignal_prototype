(AbbVie or the company) as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 1, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nAbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, neuroscience, oncology, aesthetics and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases.\nOn February 13, 2025, the board of directors of AbbVie unanimously elected Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Robert A. Michael to succeed Richard A. Gonzalez as Chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2025, at which time Mr. Gonzalez retired from the board.\nAbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States (U.S.), AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers system to agree on reimbursement terms. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment and has approximately 55,000 employees.\n2025 Strategic Objectives\nAbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to execute its strategy and advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, neuroscience, oncology, aesthetics and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) generating substantial operating cash flows to support investment in innovative research and development, and return cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also continuing to repay debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.\nThe company’s financial performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $44.5 billion, operating earnings of $10.5 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.34 and cash flows from operations of $13.8 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased 8% on a reported basis and on a constant currency basis.\nFinancial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 also included the following costs: (i) $5.6 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $5.1 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $847 million related to intangible assets impairment expense; and (iv) $273 million of acquisition and integration expenses. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands.\nRegulatory Environment\nAbbVie’s business may be impacted by risks associated with global macroeconomic conditions, including international trade disruptions and disputes as well as trade protection measures. For example, the United States government has recently imposed broad-based tariffs targeting specified countries. While the impact of these tariffs on AbbVie’s business and results of operations to date has not been material, the United States government may in the future pause, reimpose or increase tariffs and foreign governments have and, in the future, may impose retaliatory trade protection measures. Any new or additional tariffs, particularly those targeting the pharmaceuticals industry, may increase uncertainties and associated risks and could adversely impact AbbVie’s business and results of operations.\nAbbVie is also subject to public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, Executive Order 14297, issued on May 12, 2025, directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to pursue most-favored-nation (MFN) pricing, defined as the lowest price in any Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development country with a gross domestic product per capita of at least 60% of that of the United States. The order directs HHS to implement policies mandating MFN pricing along with other regulatory actions if substantial progress toward voluntary compliance is not achieved. AbbVie continues to evaluate the potential impact of this executive order, and any new or additional legislation, regulations or executive orders related to pharmaceutical pricing may increase uncertainties and associated risks and could adversely impact AbbVie’s business and results of operations.\nOn July 4, 2025, the United States government signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 (2025 Act). Included within the 2025 Act are provisions that permanently extend certain expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modify the international tax framework to reduce the tax rate on certain foreign earned income, restore the tax treatment of expensing for domestic research and development costs and bonus depreciation, and allow for full expensing of qualified production property. In addition, the legislation contains multiple effective dates and transition elections, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027. The 2025 Act also includes certain new health care provisions related to the orphan drug exclusion of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and Medicaid, which have various effective dates. The company expects the new legislation to have a favorable impact on cash tax payments in the current year. The company will continue to assess the impact of the 2025 Act as further information is made available.\nU.S. Capital Investment\nIn September 2025, AbbVie announced the start of construction of a new active pharmaceutical ingredient facility in Illinois and an expansion of biologics manufacturing and research and development capacity in Massachusetts. These projects are part of AbbVie's previously announced plan to increase capital investment in the U.S. to broadly support innovation and expand critical manufacturing capabilities and capacity.\nIntellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity\nOn September 11, 2025, AbbVie announced the settlement of litigation with all generic manufacturers that filed abbreviated new drug applications with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for generic versions of upadacitinib tablets, which AbbVie markets as Rinvoq. Given the settlement and license agreements, which are subject to standard acceleration provisions, assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted, no generic entry for any Rinvoq tablets is expected prior to April 2037 in the United States.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie’s business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie’s long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.\nAbbVie’s pipeline currently includes approximately 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements. Of these programs, approximately 60 are in mid- and late-stage development. The company’s pipeline is focused on such important specialties as immunology, neuroscience, oncology, aesthetics and eye care. AbbVie’s recently announced partnership with Gubra marks the company’s entrance into the obesity field, a therapeutic area with significant unmet need.\nThe following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.\nSignificant Programs and Developments\nIn April 2025, AbbVie announced that the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization to Rinvoq for the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) in adult patients.\nIn April 2025, AbbVie announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Rinvoq for the treatment of GCA in adult patients.\nIn July 2025, AbbVie announced positive topline results from Study 2 of its Phase 3 UP-AA trial for Rinvoq as a monotherapy in adults and adolescents with severe alopecia areata (AA).\nIn August 2025, AbbVie announced positive topline results from Study 1 of its Phase 3 UP-AA trial for Rinvoq as a monotherapy in adult and ado"
