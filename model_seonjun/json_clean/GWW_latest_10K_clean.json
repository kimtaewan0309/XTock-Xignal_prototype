Grainger, Inc., incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928, is a broad line, distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). In this report, the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear that the reference is only to W.W. Grainger, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.\nGrainger's strategic framework, “The Grainger Edge,” uniquely defines the Company by asserting why it exists, how it serves customers and how team members work together to achieve its objectives.

These reportable segments align with Grainger's go-to-market strategies and bifurcated business models of high-touch solutions and endless assortment.\nBelow is a description of Grainger’s reportable segments and other businesses.\nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A.\nThe Company's High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment provides value-added MRO solutions that are rooted in deep product knowledge and customer expertise. The high-touch solutions model serves customers with complex buying needs. This segment primarily includes the Grainger-branded businesses in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.\nThe Company’s Endless Assortment segment provides a streamlined and transparent online platform with one-stop shopping for millions of products. The Endless Assortment segment includes the Company’s Zoro Tools, Inc. (Zoro) and MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (MonotaRO) online channels which operate predominately in the U.S. and Japan.\nOther businesses is primarily comprised of the Company's\nCromwell business in the U.K. and a wholly owned captive insurance entity\nThese businesses individually and in the aggregate do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment.\nCompeting with both high-touch solutions and endless assortment business models allows Grainger to leverage its scale and advantaged supply chain to meet the changing needs of its customers. The following provides a high-level view of the Company's busin\nThe Company uses a c\nombination of its two business models to serve its more than 4.5 million\nstomers worldwide which rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations. Grainger’s customers range from smaller businesses to large corporations, government entities and other institutions, representing a broad collection of industries, including, but not limited to commercial, healthcare, and manufacturing. No single end customer accounted fo\ntal sales for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIn the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, customers are typically mid-size and large businesses with complex purchasing operations and processes. Many customers served in this segment expect product and service depth and are focused on total cost\nC\nustomers in this segment utilize sophisticated electronic purchasing platforms that communicate directly with Grainger.com through eProcurement technology.\nSales and service representatives drive relationships with customers by helping select the right products and reducing costs by utilizing Grainger as a consistent source of supply. KeepStock\n®, Grainger's inventory management\nsolution, serves customers on site, offering valuable insights to drive efficiencies and cost savings. The North American Customer Service Centers handle customer interactions for the region via phone, email, eCommerce portals and online chat.\nIn the Endless Assortment segment, customers are typically smaller and mid-size businesses with less complex purchasing operations and processes. Customers served in this segment have straight-forward product and service needs. Additionally, MonotaRO continues to attract and retain large enterprise customers. Customers purchasing through the endless assortment platforms are focused on transparent pricing and an easy-to-navigate procurement process. MonotaRO and Zoro offer an innovative customer experience by allowing customers to quickly find competitively priced products through intuitive business-focused eCommerce platforms with intelligent analytic capabilities.\nProducts and Services\nGrainger’s product offering is grouped under several broad categories,\nincluding safety and security, material handling and storage, pumps and plumbing equipment, cleaning and maintenance, metalworking and hand tools.\nProducts are regularly added and removed from Grainger's product lines based on customer demand, market research, suppliers' recommendations and other factors. No single product category comprised\nof the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIn the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, Grainger.com provides real-time price\nand product availability, detailed product information and features, such as product search and compare capabilities. The high-touch solutions businesses offer approximately 2 million products and several services, such as technical support and inventory management.\nIn the Endless Assortment segment, Grainger offers an expansive product assortment that contains millions of products including those outside of traditional industrial MRO categories. Zoro offers more than 14 million products and MonotaRO provides access to more than 24 million products, primarily through its websites and catalogs. The endless assortment businesses continue to enhance assortment by strategically ad\nding products and expanding the offer of third party held products.\nDistribution and Sources of Supply\nIn the large and fragmented MRO industry, Grainger holds an advantaged position with its supply chain infrastructure and a broad in-stock product offering\nprimary suppliers worldwide provide Grainger businesses with\nmore than 1.4 million\nproducts stocked in Distribution Centers (DCs) and branches globally. No single supplier comprised\nof Grainger's total purchases for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIn the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment, DCs are the primary order fulfillment channel, mainly through direct shipments to customers. Automation in the DCs allows orders to ship complete with next-day delivery and also replenish branches that provide same-day availability to customers. Grainger’s North American distribution network supplies inventory planning and management, transportation and distribution services to all Grainger businesses in the North American region. Branches serve the immediate needs of customers by allowing them to directly pick up items and leverage branch staff for their technical product expertise and search-and-select support.

MonotaRO fulfills customer orders through local DCs and third-party drop shipments.\nTrademarks and Service Marks\nGrainger conducts business under various trademarks and service marks. Approximately 20% of 2024 sales were private label MRO items bearing Grainger’s registered trademarks, including DAYTON®, GRAINGER®, CONDOR®, WESTWARD®, TOUGH GUY®, SPEEDAIRE®, LUMAPRO®, and AIR HANDLER®. Grainger also provides a suite of inventory services to its customers under the KEEPSTOCK® brand, which is a registered service mark. Grainger has taken steps to protect these service marks and trademarks against infringement and believes they will remain available for future use in its business.\nGrainger sells products that may have seasonal demand fluctuations during the winter or summer seasons or during periods of natural disasters. However, historical seasonality impacts have not been material to Grainger’s operating results.\nGrainger faces competition from a variety of competitors, including manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, retailers and internet-based businesses. Also, competitors vary by size, from large broad line distributors and eCommerce retailers to small local and regional competitors. Grainger differentiates itself by providing local product availability, a broad product line, sales and service representatives and advanced electronic and eCommerce technology. Grainger also offers other services, such as inventory management and technical support.\nGovernment Regulations\nGrainger’s business is subject to a wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where Grainger operates. In addition to Grainger’s U.S. based operations, which in 2024 generated approximately 82% of its consolidated net sales, Grainger operates its business principally through wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico and the U.K., and through its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan. Compliance with these laws, regulations and standards requires the dedication of time and effort of team members as well as financial resources. In 2024, compliance with the applicable laws, regulations and standards did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors\na discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact Grainger.\nThe Company strongly believes that its corporate culture must be aligned with its business strategy and aspiration to create value. To that end, Grainger's Board of Directors (the Board) and senior management are actively involved in cultivating Grainger’s culture. The Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees the Company's human capital management programs and policies and routinely provides updates to the Board.\nGrainger believes that a purpose-driven culture is an asset that creates a sustainable, competitive advantage for the Company. Building on its strong foundation while evolving a framework to address the future is critical to Grainger’s continued success. Grainger has been consistently recognized for its commitment to its culture, an inclusive workplace and team member engagement.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Gr\nainger had more than 26,000 team members worldwide, of whom approximately 23,500 were full-time and 3,000 were part-time or temporary. Approximately 85% of these team members are located in North America, 9% in Asia and 6% in Europe.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company's strategic framework, The Grainger Edge, outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors expected from Grainger’s team members in working with each other and the Company's customers, suppliers and communities. This framework helps the Company execute its strategy and create value for shareholders.\nThe Grainger Edge principles work as a system and guide the Company’s actions supporting health and safety, an inclusive workplace, and team member experience, including talent acquisition, retention, development and compensation and benefits. The Grainger Edge principles are:\nStart with the Customer\nInvest in our Success\nCompete with Urgency\nGrainger’s purpose-driven culture and p",

For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or in the associated text.\nW.W. Grainger, Inc. is a broad line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with operations primarily in North America, Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.). Grainger uses its high-touch solutions and endless assortment businesses to serve customers worldwide, who rely on Grainger for products and services that enable them to run safe, sustainable and productive operations.\nStrategic Priorities\nThe Company’s continued strategic aspiration for 2025 is to relentlessly expand Grainger’s leadership position by being the go-to partner for people who build and run safe, sustainable, and productive operations. To achieve this, each Grainger business has a set of strategic growth drivers to drive top-line revenue and MRO market outgrowth. The High-Touch Solutions North America (High-Touch Solutions N.A.) segment is focused on three areas: advantaged MRO solutions, differentiated sales and services, and unparalleled customer service. In the Endless Assortment segment, the business is focused on product assortment expansion and innovative customer acquisition and retention capabilities. Additionally, all Grainger businesses are focused on continuously enhancing our operational processes to improve service and cost through customer experience, technology and supply chain infrastructure which ultimately delivers long-term returns for shareholders.\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nThe global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty including to the commodity, labor and transportation markets, arising from a combination of geopolitical conditions and events, and various economic and financial factors. These conditions have affected the Company's operations and may continue to affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company continues to monitor economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, and the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including repercussions from changes in interest rates, currency exchange fluctuations, changing inflationary environment, and a potential recession on the Company’s business, customers, suppliers and other third parties. The Company has implemented strategies designed to mitigate certain adverse effects from the impact of the changing inflationary environment while remaining market price competitive. Historically, the Company’s broad and diverse customer base and the nondiscretionary nature of the Company’s products to its customers has helped to insulate it from the effects of recessionary periods in the industrial MRO market. The full extent and impact of these conditions are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\nResults of Operations\nIn this section, Grainger utilizes non-GAAP (as defined below) measures where it believes it will assist users of its financial statements in understanding its business. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures, see \"Non-GAAP Measures\nThe following table is included as an aid to understanding the changes in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the twelve months ended\n(in millions of dollars).\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nIncome tax provision\nLess noncontrolling interest\nNet earnings attributable to W.W.

For further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see \"Non-GAAP Measures\nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A.\nThe following table shows reported segment results (in millions of dollars):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nNet sales of $13,720 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $453 million, or 3% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to volume.\nGross profit of $5,741 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $195 million, or 4%, and gross profit margin of 41.8% was flat compared to the same period in 2023.\nSG&A of $3,356 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $144 million, or 5%, and adjusted SG&A of $3,341 million increased $155 million, or 5% compared to the same period in 2023.

The increase was due to sales growth of 12%, driven by customer acquisition for the segment and enterprise customer growth at MonotaRO. Sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange of 5% due to changes in the exchange rate between U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.\nGross profit of $923 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $59 million, or 7%, and gross profit margin of 29.5% decreased 10 basis points compared to the same period in 2023.\nSG&A of $663 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $32 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2023.

Non-GAAP measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results and other one-time items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. The Company adjusts its reported net sales when there are differences in the number of U.S. selling days relative to the prior year period and also excludes the impact on reported net sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and results of certain divested businesses. Adjusted results including adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS exclude certain non-recurring items, including restructuring charges, asset impairments, gains and losses associated with business divestitures and other non-recurring, infrequent or unusual gains and losses from the Company’s most directly comparable reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) results. The Company believes its non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Grainger’s non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nRestructuring Actions\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded restructuring charges in SG&A of $15 million in the High-Touch Solutions N.A. segment and $1 million in Grainger's Other businesses. The charges consisted primarily of team member severance and benefit costs. The Company does not expect these actions to have a material effect on its future results of operations.\nBusiness Divestitures\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Grainger divested E & R Industrial Sales, Inc. (E&R) and recorded a one-time pre-tax loss on the divestiture of $26 million in SG&A. The Company does not expect this business exit to have a material effect on its future results of operations.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of reported net sales growth from the prior year period in accordance with GAAP to the Company's non-GAAP measures daily net sales and daily, organic constant currency net sales\nfor the twelve months end\n(in millions of dollars):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nHigh-Touch Solutions N.A.\n\nThe following table shows the Company's cash flow activity for the periods presented (in millions of dollars):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\nInvesting activities\nFinancing activities\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\nIncrease in cash and cash equivalents\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2,111 million and $2,031 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by continued growth in net earnings.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $520 million and $422 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase reflects the continued investment in U.S. supply chain capacity expansion throughout 2024.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,180 million and $1,278 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was due to the issuance of long-term debt, which includes $500 million in unsecured senior notes partially offset by higher treasury stock repurchases in 2024.\nTotal debt as a percent of total capitalization was 42.9% and 40.1%, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nGrainger receives ratings from two independent credit ratings agencies: Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).
