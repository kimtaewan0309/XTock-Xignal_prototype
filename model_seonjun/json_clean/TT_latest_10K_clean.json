Due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served, we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services. They include well-established regional or specialized competitors, as well as larger U.S. and non-U.S. corporations or divisions of larger companies.\nThe principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price, quality, delivery, service and support, technology and innovation. We are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of HVAC systems and services and transport temperature control products and services.\nOur products are distributed by a number of methods, which we believe are appropriate to the type of product. U.S. sales are made through branch sales offices, distributors and dealers across the country. Non-U.S. sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world.\nOperations by Geographic Area\nApproximately 26% of our net revenues in 2024 were derived outside the U.S. and we sold products in approximately 100 countries. Therefore, the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country, such as currency devaluation, nationalization and establishment of common markets, may have an adverse impact on our non-U.S. operations.\nWe have no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenues in 2024, 2023 or 2022. No material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers; therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.\nWe both manufacture and procure many of the components included in our products. For components we manufacture, we are required to source a wide variety of commodities such as steel, copper, and aluminum. These principal commodities are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world, primarily within the region where the products are manufactured. We believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future.\nFor many components we procure, we have an effective supply chain resiliency plan and multiple capable sources to ensure sufficient supply, however there are certain categories of components that could occasionally see limited availability or shortages.\nDemand for certain products and services is influenced by weather conditions. For instance, sales in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses historically tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents spring and summer in the U.S. and other northern hemisphere markets, which are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services. Therefore, results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could positively or negatively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products, enhance existing product effectiveness, improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate. In 2024, we spent $309.6 million on research and development, focused on product and system sustainability improvements such as increasing energy efficiency, developing products that allow for use of lower global warming potential refrigerants, reducing material content in products, and designing products for circularity. New product development (NPD) programs complete a Design for Sustainability module within our NPD process to ensure that programs consider environmental impact.\nWe also have a strong focus on sustaining activities, which include costs incurred to reduce production costs, improve existing products, create custom solutions for customers and provide support to our manufacturing facilities. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development and sustaining activities to maintain and improve our competitive position.\nPatents and Licenses\nOur intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, proprietary technology, technical data, business processes, and other confidential information. Although in aggregate the Company's intellectual property is important to its operations, the Company does not consider any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, proprietary technology, technical data, business process or any other confidential information (or any related group of any such items) to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time the Company engages in litigation to protect its intellectual property rights. For a discussion of risks related to the Company's intellectual property, refer to \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nOur backlog of orders, believed to be firm, at December 31, was as follows:\nEMEA\nThese backlog figures are based on orders received and only include amounts associated with our equipment and contracting and installation performance obligations. A major portion of our residential products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock. We expect to ship a majority of the December 31, 2024 backlog during 2025. However, orders for specialized equipment or specific customer applications are submitted with extended lead times and are subject to revision and deferral, and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination. To the extent projects are delayed or there are resource constraints, the timing of our revenue could be affected.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources, reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our manufacturing processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities.\nIt is our policy to establish environmental reserves for investigation and remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. Estimated liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations due to unknown environmental conditions, changes in government laws and regulations, and changes in cleanup technologies. The environmental reserves are updated on a routine basis as remediation efforts progress and new information becomes available.\nWe are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state and international authorities. We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. In most instances at multi-party sites, our share of the liability is not material.\nIn estimating our liability at multi-party sites, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on our understanding of the parties' financial condition and probable contributions on a site-by-site basis.\nFor a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities, see Note 20 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAsbestos-Related Matters\nWe are involved in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings. In June 2020, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries Aldrich Pump LLC (Aldrich) and Murray Boiler LLC (Murray) each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte (the Bankruptcy Court). As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to the imposition of a statutory automatic stay applicable in Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases. Only Aldrich and Murray have filed for Chapter 11 relief. Neither Aldrich's wholly-owned subsidiary, 200 Park, Inc. (200 Park), Murray's wholly-owned subsidiary, ClimateLabs LLC (ClimateLabs), Trane Technologies plc nor its other subsidiaries (the Trane Companies) are part of the Chapter 11 filings. In addition, at the request of Aldrich and Murray, the Bankruptcy Court has entered an order temporarily staying all asbestos-related claims against the Trane Companies that relate to claims against Aldrich or Murray (except for asbestos-related claims for which the exclusive remedy is provided under workers' compensation statutes or similar laws).\nThe goal of these Chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos-related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants, Aldrich and Murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestos-related claims against Aldrich and Murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures.\nFor detailed information on the bankruptcy cases of Aldrich and Murray, see:\nPart I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Litigation,\"\nPart I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings,\"\nPart II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Significant Matters,\" and\nPart II, Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 20, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nHuman Capital Management\nOur people and culture are critical to achieving our operational, financial and strategic success.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 45,000 people in 61 countries including over 16,000 employees outside of the United States. Our Trane Technologies EEO-1 Report published on our website outlines additional details on our U.S. workforce composition.\nOur continued focus on building an uplifting culture, where our employees can be at their best, has positively contributed to retaining employees at strong levels. The 2024 retention rate of our key talent, those with the highest potential rating, was 97.6%, excluding retirements. Our company‑wide (all employees) voluntary retention rate excluding retirements was 91.9%.\nIn 2024, we continued to drive our purpose to boldly challenge what's possible for a sustainable world with a sharp focus on our strategic priorities and 2030 Sustainability Commitments. As part of our commitment to people and culture, we strive to create a work environment where our people uplift each other, make a positive impact on the planet and thrive at work and at home. We do that through embedding our leadership principles across our people practices such as onboarding, learning and performance management. We also focus on ongoing manager development and the important role people leaders play in our up",

Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nOur public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debt-to-total capital covenant of 65%. As of December 31, 2024, our debt-to-total capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual cash obligations include required payments of long-term debt principal and interest, purchase obligations and expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we have required payments of operating leases, income taxes and expected obligations under the Funding agreement, environmental and product liability matters. For additional information regarding leases, income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits, and contingent liabilities, see Note 10 \"Leases,\" Note 16 \"Income Taxes\" and Note 20 \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding aggregate long-term debt principal payments of $4,802.2 million, with $452.2 million payable within 12 months. The amount payable within 12 months includes $295.0 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder. The scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028. Future interest payments on long-term debt total $2,348.6 million, with $220.5 million payable within 12 months. See Note 7, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations include commitments under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders. At December 31, 2024, we had purchase obligations of $1,161.2 million, which are primarily payable within 12 months.\nIt is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. We currently expect that we will contribute approximately $30 million to our enterprise plans worldwide in 2025. The timing and amounts of future contributions are dependent upon the funding status of the plans, which is expected to vary as a result of changes in interest rates, returns on underlying assets, and other factors. See Note 11, \"Pensions and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding pensions.\nPostretirement Benefits Other than Pensions\nWe fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations. Benefit payments, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidy, are expected to be approximately $29 million in 2025. See Note 11, \"Pensions and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding postretirement benefits other than pensions.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nTrane Technologies plc (Plc or Parent Company) and certain of its 100% directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries provide guarantees of public debt issued by other 100% directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries of Plc.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from these estimates. If updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known.\nThe following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets – We have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. These assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset. In addition, an interim impairment test is completed upon a triggering event or when there is a reorganization of reporting structure or disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit.\nThe determination of estimated fair value requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Test\nImpairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. The test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the\nreporting unit is not impaired. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.\nAs quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the calculation of their estimated fair value is determined using three valuation techniques: a discounted cash flow model (an income approach), a market-adjusted multiple of earnings or revenues (a market approach), and a similar transactions method (also a market approach). The discounted cash flow approach relies on our estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing, revenue growth rates, and margins, with due consideration given to forecasting risk. The market-adjusted multiple of earnings or revenues approach reflects the market's expectations for future growth and risk, with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units. The similar transactions method considers prices paid in transactions that have recently occurred in our industry or in related industries. These valuation techniques are weighted 50%, 40% and 10%, respectively.\nUnder the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five to ten years with discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 15.5% and a terminal growth rate of 3.5% to 4.0%. Under the guideline public company method, we used multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) for most reporting units exceeded 400%. The estimated fair value of one reporting unit formed upon the acquisition of Nuvolo in November 2023 was approximately equal to its carrying value. As of December 31, 2024, this reporting unit had $313.0 million of goodwill. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of this reporting unit.\nOther Indefinite-lived intangible assets\nOther intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis. The fair value of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach) which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e., royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value would be recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess.\nIn testing our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 14.0%, terminal growth rates of 3.5%, and royalty rates ranging from 1.0% to 4.5%. For significant indefinite-lived intangible assets, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) exceeded 400%. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames.\nBusiness combinations - Acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. We include the operating results of acquired entities from their respective dates of acquisition. We recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration relating to potential earnout provisions and any non-controlling interest as of the acquisition date fair value. The valuation of intangible assets is determined using an income approach methodology. We use assumptions to value the intangible assets including projected cash flows, including revenue growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, tax rates and discount rates. The excess, if any, of total consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest is recognized as goodwill. Costs incurred as a result of a business combination other than costs related to the issuance of debt or equity securities are recorded in the period the costs are incurred.\nContingent consideration\nWe assess any contingent consideration included in the consideration paid of a business combination. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections on revenue under various potential scenarios, in which a Monte Carlo simulation model runs many iterations based on comparable companies' revenue growth rates and their implied revenue volatilities. These cash flow projections are discounted with a risk adjusted rate. Each quarter until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is evaluated at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment, specifically revenue growth rates, implied revenue volatilities and discount rates.\nRevenue recognition – Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service promised in a contract (i.e., performance obligation) is transferred to a customer. Control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service. A majority of our revenues are recognized at a point-in-time as control is transferred at a distinct point in time per the terms of a contract. However, a portion of our revenues are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract. For these arrangements, the cost-to-cost input method is used as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs.\nThe transaction price allocated to performance obligations reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from a customer. To determine the transaction price, variable and non-cash consideration are assessed as well as whether a significant financing component exists. We include variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We consider historical data in determining our best estimates of variable consideration, and the related accruals are recorded using the expected value method.\nWe enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple goods and services.
