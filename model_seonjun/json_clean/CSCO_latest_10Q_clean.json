Both provisions are a component of cost of sales.\nOur total provisions for inventory and the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were $63 million and $201 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements, then we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. For further discussion around the supply chain impacts and risks, see “—Results of Operations—Gross Margin—Supply Chain Impacts and Risks” and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Inventory Supply Chain.”\nWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required.\nThird parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nValuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\nOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in each of the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025.\nPurchased Intangible Assets\nThe accounting for acquisitions requires significant estimates and judgments in the valuation of purchased intangible assets. Critical estimates used in the valuation of purchased intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, useful lives and discount rates. While our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, these assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset group is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business\n\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nThree Months Ended October 25, 2025 Compared with Three Months Ended October 26, 2024\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we delivered strong revenue growth across all geographies and solid margins as we saw a positive demand environment. Total revenue increased by 8% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by revenue from Networking, particularly within our AI Infrastructure and Campus Networking solutions. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 10% and services revenue increased by 2%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, total software revenue was $5.7 billion across all product areas and services, an increase of 3%. Total subscription revenue increased 2%.\nTotal gross margin decreased by 0.4 percentage points. Product gross margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points, primarily driven by negative impacts from product mix and pricing, partially offset by productivity improvements and lower amortization of purchased intangible assets. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 1.8 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 5.6 percentage points primarily driven by lower restructuring and other charges and revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Diluted earnings per share increased 6%, driven by the revenue growth and operating margin improvement, partially offset by the income tax benefit of $720 million we had in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nIn terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased by $0.7 billion, EMEA revenue increased by $0.2 billion and APJC revenue increased by $0.1 billion. From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue growth across all of our customer markets. From a product category perspective, the product revenue increase of 10% was driven by growth in Networking of 15% and Observability of 6%, partially offset by declines in Collaboration of 3% and Security of 2%.\nWe continue to operate in a highly competitive environment, and one that is complex especially with respect to tariffs and trade policy. We plan to continue to invest in key priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. We remain focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing on their digital transformations and on accelerating innovation across our portfolio. We believe that we are making progress on our strategic priorities.\nStrategy and Priorities\n\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nThree Months Ended October 25, 2025 Compared with Three Months Ended October 26, 2024\nProduct gross margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points primarily driven by negative impacts from product mix and pricing, partially offset by productivity improvements and lower amortization of purchased intangible assets.\nSupply Chain Impacts and Risks\nWe regularly enter into purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and in recent periods have increased such commitments related to manufacturing Cisco Silicon One and other products to meet demand from hyperscalers and other customers. We expect to continue entering into these additional purchase commitments in fiscal 2026. These purchase commitments have in turn significantly increased our supply chain exposure. This exposure includes potential material excess and obsolete or other charges if product demand significantly decreases for a sustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products, or we are otherwise unable to mitigate this exposure. Additionally, while we are exposed to new and proposed tariffs and other trade policies, the extent of such exposure is uncertain but could be significant if the exposure remains and we are unable to mitigate it.\nServices Gross Margin\nThree Months Ended October 25, 2025 Compared with Three Months Ended October 26, 2024\nOur services gross margin percentage increased by 0.4 percentage points primarily due to cost efficiencies.\nOur services gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in "
