See Note 6, Investments, to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily due to the change in earnings mix, including lower amortization expense from the fair value step-up of inventory acquired from Horizon. The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was primarily due to the change in earnings mix, including the net unrealized gains on equity investments in the first nine months of 2025 compared to those in the prior-year period (see Note 6, Investments) and partially offset by the year-to-date Otezla impairment charges and related tax impacts (see Note 8, Goodwill and other intangible assets).\nAs previously reported, the OECD reached an agreement to align countries on a minimum corporate tax rate and an expansion of the taxing rights of market countries. Effective January 1, 2024, select individual countries, including the United Kingdom and EU member countries, have enacted the global minimum tax agreement. Additional countries, including Singapore, enacted the minimum tax agreement, effective January 1, 2025. Singapore’s enactment of the agreement applies irrespective of the Company’s incentive grant. Due to the currently enacted scope of the agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries are now subject to a 15% minimum tax rate on adjusted financial statement income. In June 2025, the United States and the other six countries that make up the G7 nations jointly announced that U.S. companies would be exempted from certain minimum taxes related to the OECD agreement. However, significant details regarding the G7 announcement remain uncertain and individual countries that have enacted the OECD agreement, including countries not within the G7, must amend their local legislation for the G7 announcement to become effective. The continued response of other countries, including the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico to the OECD agreement and the G7 announcement remains highly uncertain. The continued enactment of the OECD agreement, either by all OECD participants or unilaterally by individual countries, could result in tax increases or double taxation in the United States or foreign jurisdictions.\nOn July 4, 2025, OB3 was enacted in the United States. OB3 has various provisions, including the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and modifications to the international tax framework. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2026 and beyond. The impact of these changes on our deferred tax assets and liabilities was recorded in the third quarter of 2025 and did not have a material effect on our effective tax rate or on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010–2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for the years 2010–2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2010–2012 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion, plus interest. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2010–2012 would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued and paid on our foreign earnings.\nIn 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013–2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010–2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013–2015 that we previously reported receiving in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013–2015 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $5.1 billion, plus interest. In addition, the Notice asserts penalties of approximately $2.0 billion. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2013–2015 would be reduced by up to approximately $2.2 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued and paid on our foreign earnings.\nWe firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010–2012 and 2013–2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010–2012 and 2013–2015 Notices through the judicial process. The two cases were consolidated in the U.S. Tax Court on December 19, 2022. The trial began on November 4, 2024 and concluded on January 17, 2025. The parties filed opening post-trial briefs on June 13, 2025, and the Court held oral argument on July 16, 2025. The parties filed post-trial reply briefs on October 10, 2025. The Company expects a decision from the U.S. Tax Court no earlier than the second half of 2026.\nWe are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016–2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. We expect that the IRS will begin its audit of 2019–2022 in 2025 or early 2026, and we believe that it may seek to continue to audit similar issues related to the allocation of income between the United States and our foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we are under examination by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.\nFinal resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We continue to believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities, including from an adverse outcome in our ongoing tax dispute with the IRS and other tax examinations, enactment of the OECD minimum corporate tax rate agreement and the adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation including the OBBBA. Such tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations,\nFinancial condition, liquidity and capital resources\nSelected financial data were as follows (in millions):\nCash and cash equivalents\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\nStockholders’ equity\nCash and cash equivalents\nOur balance of cash and cash equivalents was $9.4 billion as of September 30, 2025. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.\nConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we deploy our accumulated cash balances in a strategic manner and consider a number of alternatives, including investments in innovation both internally and externally (including\ninvestments that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest), capital expenditures, repayment of debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases.\nWe intend to continue investing in our business while reducing our debt and returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. This reflects our desire to optimize our cost of capital and our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, debt levels and debt service requirements, our credit rating, availability of financing on acceptable terms, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company’s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by our overall level of cash, stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include block purchases, tender offers, accelerated share repurchases and market transactions.\nIn August 2025, March 2025 and December 2024, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $2.38 per share of common stock, which were paid in September 2025, June 2025 and March 2025, respectively, an increase of 6% over the quarterly cash dividends paid each quarter in 2024. In October 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of"
