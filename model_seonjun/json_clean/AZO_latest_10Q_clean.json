Each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consists of 16 or 17 weeks. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 has 16 weeks, and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 had 17 weeks. Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales generally occurring during the months of February through September, and the lowest sales generally occurring in the months of December and January.\nNet sales increased to $4.5 billion, a 5.4% increase over the comparable prior year quarter. Operating profit decreased 3.8% to $866.2 million, net income decreased 6.6% to $608.4 million and diluted earnings per share decreased 3.6% to $35.36 for the quarter. The third quarter was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates which had an overall impact to net sales of $89.3 million. Operating profit comparison was negatively impacted $27.1 million due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and $8.0 million net due to an unfavorable non-cash LIFO impact.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2025, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 86% of total sales, whereas they represented approximately 85% of total sales in the comparable prior year period. Failure related categories continue to be the largest portion of our sales mix.\nWe did not experience any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to the previous year. Our sales mix can be impacted by weather over a short-term period. Over the long-term, we believe the impact of weather on our sales mix is not significant.\nOur business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumers and our industry, including but not limited to inflation, interest rates, levels of consumer debt, fuel and energy costs, prevailing wage rates, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, tariffs, trade policies and other geopolitical factors, hiring and other economic conditions. Given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future.\nThe two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long-term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. For the twelve-month period ended March 2025, miles driven in the U.S. increased 1.0% compared to the same period in the prior year, based on the latest information available from the U.S. Department of Transportation. According to S&P Global Mobility, as of 2025 the average age of light vehicles on the road in the U.S. was 12.8 years.\nTwelve Weeks Ended May 10, 2025\nCompared with Twelve Weeks Ended May 4, 2024\nNet sales for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, increased $228.9 million to $4.5 billion, or 5.4% over net sales of $4.2 billion for the comparable prior year period. This growth was driven by an increase in total company same store sales of 5.4% on a constant currency basis and net sales of $97.2 million from new domestic and international stores, partially offset by a $89.3 million impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Domestic commercial sales increased $123.2 million to $1.3 billion, or 10.7% over the comparable prior year.\n\nItem 2.

We began operations in 1979 and at May 10, 2025, operated 6,537 stores in the U.S., 838 stores in Mexico and 141 stores in Brazil.

Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 52.7% for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, compared to 53.5% for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was negatively impacted by\nhigher inventory shrink, higher commercial mix, new distribution center startup costs and an unfavorable 21-basis point ($8 million net) non-cash LIFO impact\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, were $1.5 billion compared with $1.4 billion during the comparable prior year period. As a percentage of sales, these expenses were 33.3% compared with 32.2% during the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in our self-insurance expense and investments to support our growth initiatives.\nNet interest expense was $111.3 million and $104.4 million for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, respectively. Average borrowings were $9.2 billion and $8.8 billion, and weighted average borrowing rates were 4.48% and 4.43% for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, respectively.\nOur effective income tax rate was 19.4% and 18.1% of pretax income for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, respectively. The benefit from stock options exercised was $22.7 million and $38.1 million for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025 and the comparable prior year period, respectively.\nNet income for the twelve weeks ended May 10, 2025, decreased by $43.3 million from the comparable prior year period to $608.4 million due to the factors set forth above, and diluted earnings per share decreased by 3.6% to $35.36 from $36.69. The impact on current quarter diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases since the end of the comparable prior year period was an increase of $0.26 per share.\nThirty-six Weeks Ended May 10, 2025\nCompared with Thirty-six Weeks Ended May 4, 2024\nNet sales for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, increased $411.1 million to $12.7 billion, or 3.3% over net sales of $12.3 billion for the comparable prior year period. This growth was driven by an increase in total company same store sales of 3.4% on a constant currency basis and net sales of $233.5 million from new domestic and international stores, partially offset by a $238.4 million impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Domestic commercial sales increased $230.2 million to $3.5 billion, or 7.1% over the comparable prior year period.\n\nFor the thirty-six week periods ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, our net cash flows from operating activities provided $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Cash flows from operations increased over last year primarily due to favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nOur net cash flows used in investing activities for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, were $917.3 million as compared with $916.3 million in the comparable prior year period. Capital expenditures for the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, were $885.6 million compared to $725.9 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily driven by our growth initiatives, including\nnew stores and hub and mega hub store expansion projects\n. During the thirty-six week periods ended May 10, 2025, and May 4, 2024, we opened 163 and 96 net new stores, respectively. Investing cash flows were impacted by our wholly-owned captive, which purchased $54.3 million and $17.6 million, and sold $54.8 million and $21.2 million in marketable debt securities during the thirty-six weeks ended May 10, 2025, and the comparable prior year period, respect"
