  "item1_clean": "The velocity of spectrum development is expected to remain dynamic as carriers continue to deploy new bands and optimize bands that are currently in service, both of which activities we expect will require carriers to install equipment at new sites and add new equipment at existing sites. For example, past and future spectrum auctions, such as Auction 108 and Auction 110 in the U.S. are expected to continue to contribute to growth in the upcoming years. In addition, the continued deployment of 5G wireless technologies is expected to increase equipment installation at existing sites and may increase the need for new sites.\nConsumers list network quality as a key contributor when terminating or changing service. To remain competitive and to decrease subscriber churn rates, wireless carriers have made substantial capital investments into their wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage. We expect wireless carriers to continue to expend capital to differentiate their product offerings.\nWe believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably well-capitalized, highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services; therefore, we expect that we will see a multi-year trend of additional demand for tower space from our customers, which we believe will translate into steady leasing growth for us.\nSite Leasing Services\nOur primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the United States, South America, Central America, Canada, and Africa. We derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants. Wireless service providers enter into (1) individual tenant site leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site or (2) master lease agreements with us, which provide for the material terms and conditions that will apply to multiple sites; although, in most cases, each individual site under a master lease agreement is also governed by its own site leasing agreement which sets forth pricing and other site specific terms. Our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit, representing 96.2% or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three fiscal years. Our site leasing business is classified into two reportable segments, domestic site leasing and international site leasing.\nDomestic Site Leasing\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned 17,464 sites in the United States and its territories. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated 73.7% of our total site leasing revenue from these sites. We derive domestic site leasing revenues primarily from T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon Wireless. In the United States, our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to ten years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific annual rent escalators, including renewal option periods. Our ground leases and other property interests in the United States are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods, which are at our option, and provide for specific annual rent escalators. As of December 31, 2024, no U.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total tower portfolio by tower count, and no U.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nInternational Site Leasing\nWe currently own and operate towers in 13 international markets throughout South America, Central America, Canada, and Africa. As of December 31, 2024, we owned 22,285 sites in our international markets, of which approximately 30% of our total towers are located in Brazil and no other international markets (each country is considered a market) represented more than 5% of our total towers. Our operations in our international markets are primarily in the site leasing business, and we continue to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towers and organic growth.\nWe derive international site leasing revenues from all the major carriers in each of the 13 countries in which we operate. Our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to fifteen years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant. Our tenant leases typically either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators, (2) escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index, or (3) escalate using a combination of fixed and inflation adjusted escalators. In addition, our international site leases may include pass-through charges, such as rent related to ground leases and other property interests, utilities, and fuel.\nIn our international markets, ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods, which are at our option. Our ground leases typically either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators or (2) escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index.\n\nOn January 10, 2025, we sold all our towers and ended our operations in the Philippines and on February 20, 2025, we entered into an agreement to sell all of our towers and related assets held in Colombia. Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed 98.4% of our total segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2024. In our site leasing business, we (1) lease space to wireless service providers and other customers on assets that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, we owned 39,749 towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.\nOur primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business through organic growth and expansion of our tower portfolio to create shareholder value. We believe that the long-term and repetitive nature of our site leasing business will permit us to maintain a stable, recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending which arises in our site development business. We believe that our tower operations are highly scalable. Consequently, we believe that we are able to materially increase our domestic and international tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling, general, and administrative expenses. Key elements of our strategy include:\nMaximizing our Tower Capacity.\nWe generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures. Most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas, and we believe that increased use of our towers’ structural capacity can generate additional lease revenue and be achieved at a low incremental cost. We measure the available capacity of our existing sites to support additional tenants by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, wind loading, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. We actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force. As of December 31, 2024, we had an average of 1.9 tenants per site.\nCapitalizing on our Scale and Management Experience.\nWe are a large owner, operator and developer of towers, with substantial capital, human, and operating resources. We have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the U.S. since 1989 and have owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997. We believe our size, experience, capabilities, and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the U.S. and internationally. Our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development, with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries. We believe that our industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will permit us to continue to organically grow our site leasing and site development services.\nSystematic Tower Portfolio Growth.\nWe intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures. We believe that one of the best uses of our liquidity, including cash from operating activities and borrowings, is to acquire and/or build new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our long-term target leverage ratios.\nDisciplined Domestic and International Tower Acquisitions.\nIn our tower acquisition program, we pursue towers from third parties that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns. For each acquisition, we prepare various analyses that include projections of several different investment return metrics, review of available capacity, future lease up projections, and a summary of current and future tenant/technology mix. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we entered into a purchase agreement with Millicom International Cellular S.A. (“Millicom”) for over 7,000 sites throughout Central America. This transaction supports our desire to secure our position as a leader in our international markets and align ourselves with the leading carriers in such markets.\nStrategic New Builds.\nWe believe strategic new builds can contribute to profitable growth, particularly in our international markets. In our new build program, we construct tower structures (1) under build-to-suit arrangements or (2) in locations that are strategically chosen by us. Under build-to-suit arrangements, we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified. Under these arrangements, we retain ownership of the tower structure and\n\nDomestic Site Leasing\n– In the U.S., our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are (1) large independent tower companies including American Tower Corporation and Crown Castle International; (2) a number of regional independent tower owners; (3) wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers; (4) owners and operators of alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, billboards, utility poles, and electric transmission towers; and (5) owners and operators of alternative wireless technology systems and architectures.\nInternational Site Leasing\n– Internationally, our competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks, large multinational, national, and regional independent tower companies, and alternative facilities such as rooftop, outdoor and indoor networks, billboards, utility poles, and electric transmission towers.\nWe believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market, and price historically have been, and will continue to be, the most significant competitive factors affecting the domestic and international site leasing business.\n– The site development business is competitive and price sensitive. We believe that the majority of our competitors in the U.S. site development business operate within local region and market areas, while some firms offer their services nationally. The market includes participa",
  "item7_clean": "Domestic site leasing asset impairment and decommission costs decreased $88.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This change was primarily as a result of a decrease in impairment charges resulting from our regular analysis of whether the future cash flows from certain towers are adequate to recover the carrying value of the investment in those towers and a decrease in tower and equipment related decommission costs. The prior year included increased impairment charges resulting from the planned abandonment of identified sites with minimal expectations of future economic benefit (primarily from Sprint churn).\nInternational site leasing asset impairment and decommission costs increased $28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, international site leasing asset impairment and decommission costs increased $32.7 million. These changes were primarily as a result of an increase in impairment charges resulting from our regular analysis of whether the future cash flows from certain towers are adequate to recover the carrying value of the investment in those towers and an increase in tower decommission costs.\nDepreciation, Accretion, and Amortization Expenses:\n\nDomestic site leasing operating income increased $400.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in depreciation, accretion, and amortization expense and asset impairment and decommission costs and higher segment operating profit, partially offset by increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses and acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses.\nInternational site leasing operating income increased $113.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, international site leasing operating income increased $126.9 million. These changes were\nprimarily due to a decrease in depreciation, accretion, and amortization expense and higher segment operating profit, partially offset by an increase in asset impairment and decommission costs.\nSite development operating income decreased $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower segment operating profit driven by less carrier activity, partially offset by a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nOther operating expense decreased $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in selling, general, and administrative expenses and asset impairment and decommission costs.\nOther Income (Expense):\n\nDomestic site leasing segment operating profit increased $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher domestic site leasing revenue as noted above, partially offset by the incremental costs associated with towers acquired and built since January 1, 2023.\nInternational site leasing segment operating profit increased $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, international site leasing segment operating profit increased $31.8 million. These changes were primarily due to higher international site leasing revenues as noted above, partially offset by the incremental costs associated with towers acquired and built since January 1, 2023.\nSite development segment operating profit decreased $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, as a result of decreased carrier activity.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses:\n\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was\nprimarily due to an increase in cash outflows associated with working capital changes related to the timing of customer payments and increases in cash selling, general, and administrative expenses and cash asset impairment and decommission costs as well as a decrease in site development segment operating profit, partially offset by increases in site leasing segment operating profit and interest income.\nInvesting Activities\nA detail of our cash capital expenditures is as follows:\n\nlease agreements (“MLA”) with us, which provide for the material terms and conditions that will apply to multiple sites; although, in most cases, each individual site under a MLA is also governed by its own site leasing agreement which sets forth pricing and other site specific terms. Our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to fifteen years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant. Our tenant leases typically either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators, (2) escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index, or (3) escalate using a combination of fixed and inflation adjusted escalators. In addition, our international site leases may include pass-through charges, such as rent related to ground leases and other property interests, utilities, property taxes, and fuel.\nCost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:\nCash and non-cash rental expense on ground leases, right-of-use, and other underlying property interests;\nSite maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);\nFuel (in those international markets that do not have an available electric grid at our tower sites); and\nLease initial direct cost amortization.\nGround leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods, which are at our option. Our ground leases either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators, or (2) escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 72% of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. For any given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The amount of property taxes varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. The ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.\nIn Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our activities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Specifically, most of our ground leases and other property interests, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are paid in U.S. dollars. In most of our Central American markets, our local currency obligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. In Brazil, Canada, Chile, and South Africa, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency. In Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, and Tanzania, our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and U.S. dollars.\nAs indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.\n\nWe believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins, and low customer churn (which refers to a lease that is non-renewed, cancelled, or discounted prior to the end of its term) other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of specific technology.\nWe believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion, and network coverage requirements.\nDuring 2025, we expect core leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to increase over 2024 levels, on a currency neutral basis, due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum, the full year impact of towers acquired and built during 2024, and the revenues from towers expected to be acquired and built during 2025. We believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs, and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures.\nDue to the nature and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal.\nConsequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment. Furthermore, because our towers\n\nare strategically positioned, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology.\nOur site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end-to-end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis, through regional, market, and project offices. The market offices are responsible for all site development operations.\nFor information regarding our operating segments, see Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report.\nCapital Allocation Strategy\nOur capital allocation strategy is aimed at increasing shareholder value through investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria, stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value, and by returning cash generated by our operations in the form of cash dividends. In addition, in a high interest rate environment and when we believe interest rates may stay higher for longer, we believe that debt repayments, especially of our variable rate debt, may be an accretive use of our excess capital. While the addition of cash dividends and debt repayments have provided us with additional tools to return value to our shareholders, we continue to believe that our priority is to make investments focused on increasing Adjusted Funds From Operations per share. Key elements of our capital allocation strategy include:\nWe intend to continue to grow our asset portfolio, domestically and internationally, primarily through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers that meet our internal return on invested capital criteria.\nStock Repurchase Program.\nWe currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below its intrinsic value. We believe that share repurchases, when purchased at the right price, will facilitate our goal of increasing our Adjusted Funds From Operations per share.\nCash dividends are an additional component of our strategy of returning value to shareholders. We do not expect our dividend to require any changes in our leverage and believe that, due to our low dividend payout ratio, we can continue to focus on building and buying quality assets and opportunistically buying back our stock. While the timing and amount of future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board of Directors, we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to grow our cash dividend in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for management’s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we completed our assessment on the remaining estimated useful lives of our towers and intangible assets. We concluded through our assessment that, for U.S. GAAP purposes, we should modify our current estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience and the findings obtained by our independent consultant. We previously depreciated our towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the (i) term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or (ii) estimated useful life of a tower, which we had historically estimated to be 15 years. Based on our assessment, we revised the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets (which are amortized on a similar basis to our tower assets, as their useful lives correlate to the useful life of the towers) from 15 years to 30 years, effective January 1, 2024. We accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate under ASC 250 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” The impact of the change in estimate was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2024, resultin",
