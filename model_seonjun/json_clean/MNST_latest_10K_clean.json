  "item1_clean": "Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors (“bottlers/distributors”). In some cases, we sell ready-to-drink packaged drinks directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience and gas chains, drug stores, foodservice customers, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military.\nOur Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling “concentrates” and/or “beverage bases” to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold by such bottlers to other bottlers/distributors and to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience and gas chains, foodservice customers, drug stores, value stores, e-commerce retailers and the military. To a lesser extent, our Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling certain ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers/distributors.\nGenerally, the Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates higher per case net operating revenues, but lower per case gross profit margin percentages than the Strategic Brands segment.\nThe Company’s Alcohol Brands segment primarily generates operating revenues by selling kegged and ready-to-drink canned beers, FMBs and hard seltzers, primarily to beer distributors in the United States.\nGenerally, the Alcohol Brands segment has lower gross profit margin percentages than the Monster Energy® Drinks segment.\nFor certain risks with respect to our beverages see “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” below.\nIn the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his sons started a business selling fresh non-pasteurized juices in Los Angeles, California. In 1977, Tim Hansen, one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen, perceived a demand for shelf stable pasteurized natural juices and juice blends and formed Hansen Foods, Inc. (“HFI”). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include Hansen’s Natural Soda® brand sodas. In 1990, California Co-Packers Corporation (d/b/a Hansen Beverage Company) (“CCC”) acquired certain assets of HFI, including the right to market the Hansen’s® brand name. In 1992, Hansen Natural Corporation acquired the Hansen’s® brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC. Under our ownership, the Hansen’s® beverage business significantly expanded to include a wide range of beverages within the growing “alternative” beverage category including, in particular, energy drinks. In 2012, we changed our name from Hansen Natural Corporation to Monster Beverage Corporation. In 2015, we acquired various energy brands from TCCC and disposed of our non-energy drink business. In 2016, we completed our acquisition of flavor supplier and long-time business partner AFF. In 2022, we completed our acquisition of Monster Brewing Company, which facilitated our entry into the alcohol beverage sector. In 2023, we completed our acquisition of the Bang Energy® drink business.\nOn May 1, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to execute a modified “Dutch auction” tender offer to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock. On May 8, 2024, the Company commenced the tender offer, with such offer expiring on June 5, 2024. On June 10, 2024, the Company accepted for purchase a total of approximately 56.6 million shares of common stock at a purchase price of $53.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.0 billion. The repurchase was funded with approximately $2.25 billion of cash on hand and approximately $750 million in borrowings. The cost of these shares and the fees relating to the tender offer are included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024.\n2024 Product Introductions\nDuring 2024, we continued to expand our existing energy drink portfolio by adding additional products to our portfolio in a number of countries and further developed our distribution markets. During 2024, we sold the following new products to our customers:\nBang Energy® Sour Ropes\nJava Monster® Irish Crème\n\nLimits on Caffeine Content.\nLegislation has been proposed to limit the amount of caffeine that may be contained in beverages, including energy drinks. Some jurisdictions where we do business have prescribed limits on caffeine content for beverages. For example, in Canada, the maximum amount of caffeine in a caffeinated energy drink cannot exceed 180mg per single-serving container or per serving (500 ml) in the case of a multi-serving container. We adjusted the caffeine levels in certain of our Monster Energy® products that are sold in Canada as caffeinated energy drinks to address these regulations, although the majority of our products were unaffected. In Europe, examples of caffeine restrictions include the Netherlands where there is a limit of 35mg/100ml, and Norway introduced, as of January 1, 2020, a limit of 32mg/100ml. Caffeine limit restrictions or restrictions on combining caffeine with other ingredients or in particular product sectors (such as performance beverages/sport drinks) have also been implemented or proposed in other jurisdictions, including Turkey, India, Pakistan’s Punjab region, Egypt, Colombia, Iraq, and the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Such restrictions could require reformulations of certain of our products. However, we may not be able to satisfactorily reformulate our products in all jurisdictions that adopt similar legislation.\nLimitations on Container Size.\nWe package our products in a variety of different package types and sizes including, for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, aluminum cans larger than 16 fluid ounces. Certain jurisdictions, such as Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, and the Dominican Republic, have considered container size limitations on energy drinks and other beverages. If adopted, such limitations may require us to change the container size of our products sold in certain countries.\nCompliance with Alcohol-Related Regulation and Laws.\nOur Alcohol Brands segment is regulated by federal, state and local governments in both the U.S. and abroad whose laws and regulations govern the production, distribution and sale of alcohol beverages, including licensing, permitting, advertising and marketing. To operate our breweries, manufacturing facilities and other alcohol-related facilities, as well as to sell our alcohol products, we must obtain and maintain numerous approvals, licenses and permits from governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), the FDA, state and local alcohol regulatory agencies and state and federal environmental agencies. Our breweries, in particular, are subject to audits and inspections by TTB and applicable state alcohol regulatory agencies at any time.\nOur alcohol beverages are also subject to various taxes, license fees, and the like levied by governmental entities as well as bonds that such entities may deem necessary to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. One such tax that we must comply with is the U.S. federal excise tax. Beginning in January 2018, the federal excise taxes imposed on domestic brewers that produce less than 2 million barrels annually were reduced from $7.00 to $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels shipped annually. State and local excise taxes, on the other hand, vary based on the alcohol content and type of beverage. Federal, state, or local governments may increase such excise taxes in the future.\nCompliance with Environmental Laws.\nOur facilities and those of our co-packers in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, water discharges, the use of water resources, waste disposal, and recycling. Our operations in other countries are subject to similar federal, state, local and supranational laws and regulations that may be applicable in such countries. Changes in environmental compliance mandates, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance and future growth. In addition, continuing concern over environmental matters, including climate change, is expected to continue to result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in and outside of the United States), including to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, or to expand mandatory reporting of certain environmental, social and governance metrics. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.\nVarious municipalities, states and foreign countries require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary by jurisdiction. Other deposit, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship proposals have been, and may in the future be, introduced and enacted at the federal, state, and local levels, and in foreign countries.\nIn California, we are required to collect redemption values from our customers and to remit such redemption values to the State of California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. In certain other states and countries where our products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states.\n\nPlay® and Power Play® (stylized)\nBPM®\nBU®\nWe also develop, market, sell and distribute craft beers, flavored malt beverages (“FMBs”) and hard seltzers under a number of brands, including Jai Alai® IPA, Florida Man® IPA, Dale’s Pale Ale®, Wild Basin® Hard Seltzers, Dallas Blonde®, Deep Ellum\nTM\nIPA, Perrin Brewing Company® Black Ale, Hop Rising® Double IPA, Wasatch® Apricot Hefeweizen, The Beast\nTM\n, Nasty Beast® Hard Tea and a host of other brands.\nWe also develop, market, sell and distribute still and sparkling waters under the Monster Tour Water® brand name.\nThe “alternative” beverage category combines non-carbonated, ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, single-serve juices and fruit beverages, ready-to-drink dairy and coffee drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks and single-serve still waters (flavored, unflavored and enhanced) with “new age” beverages, including sodas that are considered natural, sparkling juices and flavored sparkling beverages. According to Beverage Marketing Corporation, domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2024 for the “alternative” beverage category of the market are estimated at approximately $74.2 billion, representing an increase of approximately 1.1% over estimated domestic U.S. wholesale sales in 2023 of approximately $73.4 billion.\nWe have four operating and reportable segments: (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment (“Monster Energy® Drinks”), which is primarily comprised of our Monster Energy® drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel® high performance energy drinks, Reign Storm® total wellness energy drinks and Bang Energy® drinks, (ii) Strategic Brands segment (“Strategic Brands”), which is primarily comprised of the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (“TCCC”) in 2015 as well as our affordable energy brands, Predator® and Fury®, (iii",
  "item7_clean": "We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors.\nValue Drivers of our Business\nWe believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following:\nInternational Growth\n– The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our brands internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. One or more of our products are distributed in approximately 159 countries and territories worldwide.\n– We believe “functional” value-added beverage brands supported by marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We are focused on increasing the profit margins for our Monster Energy® Drinks segment, our Strategic Brands segment and our Alcohol Brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth.\n– The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on mitigating increases and/or reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales.\nEfficient Capital Structure\n– Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of days outstanding for accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus.\nWe believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) reducing our expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations.\nNet sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2025 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations”).\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had working capital of $2.54 billion compared to $4.43 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments related to treasury stock repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.93 billion as compared to $1.72 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Principal uses of cash flows in 2024 were purchases of treasury stock and purchases of real property, property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).\nOpportunities, Challenges and Risks\nLooking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant stockholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”\n\nNet sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment were $6.86 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $309.5 million, or 4.7% higher than net sales of $6.56 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand as well as due to the Pricing Actions. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $210.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nNet sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $432.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $55.6 million, or 14.8% higher than net sales of $376.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Burn®, Predator®, NOS® and Fury® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $37.1 million for the Strategic Brands segment for the year ended December 31, 2024. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 24.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024. Net sales of concentrates within the Strategic Brands segment tend to have more pronounced fluctuations from period to period as compared to net sales of our finished goods within the Monster Energy® Drinks segment primarily as a result of bottler production schedules.\nNet sales for the Alcohol Brands segment were $172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of approximately $12.5 million, or 6.8% lower than net sales of $184.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to decreased sales by volume of craft beers.\nNet sales for the Other segment were $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 0.3% higher than net sales of $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCase sales for our energy drink products, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 846.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately 77.4 million cases or 10.1% higher than case sales of 769.2 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2023. The overall average net sales per case for our energy drink products (excluding net sales of Alcohol Brands and Other segments) decreased to $8.62 for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was 4.4% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.01 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in overall average net sales per case for our energy drink products for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales as well as geographical/product sales mix.\nCase sales for our craft beers, FMBs and hard seltzers in 192-ounce equivalents, were 12.5 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of approximately 0.7 million cases or 5.0% lower than case sales of 13.1 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2023. Barrel sales for our craft beers, FMBs and hard seltzers in 31 U.S. gallon equivalents, were 0.60 million barrels for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of approximately 0.03 million barrels or 5.0% lower than barrel sales of 0.64 million barrels for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGross profit was $4.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $254.7 million, or 6.7% higher than the gross profit of $3.79 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the increase in net sales.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 53.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily the result of the Pricing Actions, decreased freight-in costs and decreased aluminum can costs\n, partially offset by production inefficiencies\nTotal operating expenses were $2.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $277.7 million, or 15.1% higher than total operating expenses of $1.84 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nthe Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities;\nthe Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers;\nincentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals;\ndiscounted or free products;\ncontractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and\ncommissions paid to TCCC based on our sales to certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of TCCC and/or to certain companies accounted for under the equity method by TCCC.\nThe Company’s promotional allowance programs for its energy drink products with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances for its energy drink products are calculated based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.\nPromotional and other allowances for the Alcohol Brands segment primarily include price promotions where permitted.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this report may constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things. All statements containing a projection of revenues, income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items, a statement of management’s plans and objectives for future operations, or a statement of future economic performance contained in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, including statements related to new products, volume growth and statements encompassing general optimism about future operating results and non-historical information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Exchange Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “thinks,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “estimates” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\n\nManagement cautions that these statements are qualified by their terms and/or important factors, many of which are outside our control and involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made including, but not limited to, the following:\nLack of anticipated demand for our products in domestic and/or international markets;\nOur ability to sustain the current level of sales of and/or achieve growth for our Monster Energy®, Reign Total Body Fuel®, Reign Storm®, Bang Energy® and NOS® brand energy drinks and/or our other products, including our Strategic Brands and Alcohol Brands;\nDecreased demand for our products resulting from changes in consumer preferences, including, but not limited to: changes in demand for different packages, sizes and configurations; changes due to perceived health concerns such as obesity, ingredients in our products or packaging, and alcohol abuse; changes due to product safety concerns; and/or changes due to decreased consumer discretionary spending power;\nThe impact on our business of competitive products and pricing pressures and our ability to increase or maintain our market share as a result of actions by competitors, including unsubstantiated and/or misleading claims, false advertising claims and tortious interference, as well as competitors selling misbranded products;\nOur ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of the Bang Energy® business;\nOur ability to rationalize brands acquired from Monster Brewing Company;\nOur ability to achieve profitability within our Alcohol Brands segment;\nOur ability to absorb, mitigate or pass on cost increases to our bottlers/distributors and/or customers and/or consumers;\nThe impact of rising costs, interest rates, and inflation on the discretionary income of our consumers;\nChanges in U.S. trade policies as a result of any legislation proposed by the recently inaugurated U.S. presidential administration or U.S. Congress, which include tariffs on aluminum;\nThe impact of military conflicts, including supply chain disruptions, volatility in commodity and energy prices, increased economic uncertainty and escalating geopolitical tensions;\nFluctuations in growth and/or growth rates (positive or negative) of the domestic and international energy drink categories generally, including in the convenience and gas channel (which is our largest channel) and the impact on demand for our products resulting from deteriorating economic conditions and/or financial uncertainties, including a slowdown in consumer spending generally or reduced demand for consumer goods;\nThe impact of temporary or permanent facility closures, production slowdowns and disruptions in operations experienced by our manufacturing facilities, our suppliers, bottlers/distributors, co-packers, and/or breweries, including any material disruptions on the production and distribution of our products;\nDisruption to our and/or our co-packers’ manufacturing facilities and operations due to severe weather, natural disasters, climate change, labor-related issues, production difficulties, capacity limitations, cybersecurity incidents or other causes, which could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results;\nOur ability to modify our manufacturing facilities to comply with safety, health, environmental, and other regulations;\nThe consolidation of co-packers leading us to inc",
