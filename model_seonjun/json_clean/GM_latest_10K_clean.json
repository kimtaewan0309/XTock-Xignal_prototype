  "item1_clean": "General Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, General Motors or GM) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our segments. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. Forward-looking statements in this Business section are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and AVs, software-enabled services and subscriptions and new business opportunities, while strengthening our market position in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).\nWe are offering customers choice with our diverse EV lineup. A key element in our EV strategy is our dedicated EV propulsion architecture. Our current-generation, flexible EV platform is being deployed across multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, leveraging our technology to expand our EV portfolio over a wide and growing variety of segments and price points. With our next-generation battery technology, we intend to expand to multiple chemistries, multiple form factors and multiple cell suppliers as we continue to deliver even more EV choices for our customers.\nTo support our expanding portfolio of EVs, we have made significant investments in our plants across North America. GM’s Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center is a fully dedicated EV facility which produces a variety of vehicles, including the GMC HUMMER EV Pickup and SUV, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the recently launched Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, with globally sourced parts. GM's CAMI Assembly is Canada's first full-scale EV manufacturing facility. We plan to convert Orion Assembly in Orion Township, Michigan to build electric pickups, with the plant slated to begin production in 2026. GM is also investing in our propulsion, stamping and components plants to support EV production. We are mass-producing battery cells for these and other future EVs through Ultium Cells Holdings LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution) in plants in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee, with plans to expand our battery cell manufacturing footprint, including in Indiana through a joint venture with Samsung SDI.\nGM's all-electric future is guided by customer choice and focused on delivering a world-class portfolio of EVs and an ecosystem to support them, while maintaining a compelling lineup of gas-powered vehicles. GM EV drivers have access to more than 231,000 chargers across North America. This includes access to more than 20,000 Tesla Superchargers with the use of a GM-approved North American Charging Standard adapter. In 2024, GM also announced that it will enhance its collaboration with EVgo to build 2,850 DC fast charging stalls, including 400 fast chargers at flagship destinations in major metropolitan areas across the U.S. GM is also a founding member of IONNA, a joint venture with seven other automakers aiming to create a high-powered charging network with a targeted installation of at least 30,000 chargers in urban and highway locations throughout North America. The joint venture broke ground on its first charging station in October 2024.\nSoftware-Enabled Services and Subscriptions\n\nOur vehicles are equipped with a suite of software-enabled services, including OnStar services, Super Cruise and others. With nearly three decades of experience, OnStar is a global leader in enabling automotive services. OnStar is currently available in 20 markets globally and growing. As GM introduces more software-defined vehicles, OnStar is playing a key role as an enabler of active safety, infotainment, connectivity and driver assistance features. OnStar provides one ecosystem for retail and fleet customers to use, engage and shop through a broader set of service offerings available at and after vehicle purchase. Our end-to-end software platform provides customers with\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nsoftware-defined features, apps and services over-the-air and will empower customers to update their ownership experiences with desirable features, software services, vehicle performance and Super Cruise. Super Cruise enables drivers of properly equipped vehicles to travel hands-free on more than 530,000 miles of compatible roads, and soon to be approximately 750,000 miles, in the U.S. and Canada. Additional software-enabled features are expected to be available in the near future including security features, climate and comfort options, personal themes and EV ownership experience elements. Many of GM's latest electric and internal combustion vehicles are employing this software platform as it rolls out across most products in the coming years.\nGM Cruise Holdings LLC (Cruise Holdings), our majority-owned subsidiary, has been pursuing the development and commercialization of AV technology for deployment in a robotaxi application. In December 2024, we announced plans to refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles and that we would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work. We are pursuing the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Cruise, and as of December 31, 2024, we owned approximately 97% of Cruise. Following the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests and subject to approval of the Cruise Board of Directors, we expect to work with the Cruise leadership team to restructure Cruise's operations and combine the GM and Cruise technical efforts to build on the success of Super Cruise and prioritize the development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) on a path to fully autonomous personal vehicles. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of the risks associated with our AV strategy.\nOver the last year, we have engaged and actively cooperated with certain federal and state agencies who opened investigations or made inquiries to us and Cruise in connection with an accident involving a Cruise robotaxi in October 2023. We and Cruise have resolved the investigations and inquiries by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the U.S. Department of Justice and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). Specifically, in July 2024, Cruise entered into a settlement agreement with the CPUC that imposed a $112,500 fine on Cruise and various reporting obligations. In September 2024, Cruise and NHTSA executed a Consent Order, which imposed a $1.5 million fine on Cruise and requires enhanced reporting and engagement with NHTSA for two years (with an optional third year at NHTSA's discretion). In November 2024, Cruise entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California relating to the October 2023 accident. Under the terms of the DPA, Cruise admitted to one count of submitting a false report to a federal agency and paid a $500,000 monetary penalty. The government will not pursue an indictment or prosecution so long as Cruise complies with the terms of the DPA over the next three years by undertaking certain remedial measures, maintaining a safety compliance program and submitting reports to the government no less than annually. GM is neither a party nor a signatory to these agreements.\nCompetitive Position and Vehicle Sales\n\nThe principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy or range and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.\nWe present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and market share. Wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors, as well as sales to the U.S. government, and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2024, 27.9% of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\nGMNA\nGMI\nTotal vehicle sales data represents: (1) retail sales (i.e., sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or distributors); (2) fleet sales (i.e., sales to large and small businesses, governments and daily rental car companies); and (3) sales of courtesy transportation vehicles (i.e., vehicles previously used by dealers that were sold to the end consumer). Total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures, which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China. While total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during a particular period, we believe it is indicative\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nof the underlying demand for our vehicles. Total vehicle sales data represents management's good faith estimate based on sales reported by our dealers, distributors and joint ventures; commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data; and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is not available.\nThe following table summarizes industry and GM total vehicle sales and our related competitive position by geographic region (vehicles in thousands):\n\nWe market vehicles and automotive parts primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets. Our customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties. The number of authorized dealerships and other agents performing similar functions were 4,588 in GMNA and 6,594 in GMI at December 31, 2024.\nWe, and our joint ventures, enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the d",
  "item7_clean": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes. Forward-looking statements in this MD&A are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our\nis incorporated by reference into this MD&A.\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. We will adapt to customer preferences while executing our growth-focused strategy to invest in EVs, hybrids, personal AV technology, software-enabled services and other new business opportunities. To support strong margins and cash flow during this transition, we are strengthening our market position in profitable ICE vehicles, such as trucks and SUVs. We plan to execute our strategy\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nwith a steadfast commitment to good corporate citizenship through more sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.\nOur financial performance in 2024 was driven by the strength of our vehicle portfolio including high margin full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, strong consumer demand for our products and the execution of our core business strategy. We remain focused on maintaining an efficient cost structure and pricing discipline. We are monitoring industry pricing pressures, changing interest rates, inflation, warranty claims, consumer demand trends and potential changes in the regulatory environment. We continue to prioritize driving down costs and building scale in our EV portfolio to improve profitability.\nAs we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results. Refer to the \"Consolidated Results\" and regional sections of this MD&A for additional information.\nWe face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other factors, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emission standards, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these challenges.\nFor the year ending December 31, 2025, we expect earnings per share (EPS)-diluted and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $11.00 and $12.00, Net income attributable to stockholders of between $11.2 billion and $12.5 billion and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted of between $13.7 billion and $15.7 billion. These expected financial results do not include the potential impact of future adjustments related to special items. Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section of this MD&A for additional information.\nThe following table reconciles expected Net income attributable to stockholders under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to expected EBIT-adjusted (dollars in billions):\nYear Ending December 31, 2025\nNet income attributable to stockholders\nAutomotive interest income, net\nWe do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results.\nGMNA\nIndustry sales in North America were 20.3 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of 3.5% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. U.S. industry sales were 16.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of 2.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.7 million units for a market share of 16.5% in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2025 on the continuing strength of our product portfolio, improving EV margins and continuing cost discipline, partially offset by pricing moderation with increased incentives and higher depreciation expense. While we expect EV margins to improve in 2025, we may continue to recognize losses to adjust inventory to net realizable value. Our outlook is dependent on continued supply chain availability, EV-related cost reduction and the resiliency of the U.S. economy and overall economic conditions, including the potential imposition of tariffs or other trade restrictions by the U.S. or its trading partners.\nGMI\nIndustry sales in China were 26.6 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of 6.4% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our total vehicle sales in China were 1.8 million units resulting in a market share of 6.9% in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 1.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Intense price competition with significant excess capacity from both new market entrants and established competitors offering vehicles at lower prices and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEVs continue to negatively impact the profitability of our operations in China. Additionally,\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nwe believe independent, Chinese automakers are expanding market share and prioritizing production volumes over profitability, with the ability to produce vehicles at costs well below foreign automakers, including our Automotive China JVs. These factors are impacting our China JVs’ ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JVs. We are in the late stages of finalizing details with our JV partners on an agreement regarding certain restructuring actions, which include plant closures and portfolio optimization to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions, and updated business forecasts.\nBased on the updated forecast, we determined that the material loss in value of our equity interests in SAIC General Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), SAIC GM (Shenyang) Norsom Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM Norsom), SAIC GM Dong Yue Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM DY) and SAIC GM Dong Yue Powertrain Co., Ltd. (SGM DYPT) was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024 which is included in equity income (loss). Our Automotive China JVs' equity losses also includes non-cash charges of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of the restructuring plan. We expect additional restructuring charges are likely to be incurred in 2025. Going forward, we will continue to assess our strategy in the Chinese market to maintain presence while prioritizing profitability. In addition, GM Financial also concluded that a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC) existed. Refer to the \"Automotive Financing – GM Financial Summary and Outlook” section of this MD&A for discussion of GM Financial’s other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC.\nOutside of China, industry sales were 25.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.9 million units for a market share of 3.7% in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\nCruise Holdings, our majority-owned subsidiary, has been pursuing the development and commercialization of AV technology for deployment in a robotaxi application. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed development work on the Cruise Origin and recorded restructuring charges of $0.6 billion primarily related to non-cash write-offs of Origin assets. In December 2024, we announced plans to refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles and that we would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work. Refer to Part I, Item 1. Business for a further discussion on Cruise. In conjunction with our announcement to no longer fund Cruise’s robotaxi development work and our plans to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges of $0.5 billion. These charges primarily relate to anticipated headcount reductions and impairments of real estate lease assets and certain intangible assets.\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook\nWe believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 39% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 42% in the corresponding period in 2023. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing programs available and competing third-party financing products in the market. GM Financial's prime loan originations as a percentage of total loan originations in North America was 81% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 82% in the corresponding period in 2023. In the year ended December 31, 2024, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 46%, retail finance charge income of 40% and commercial finance charge income of 8%.\nGM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion were included in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in gains is primarily due to fewer terminated leases in 2024 compared to 2023. The following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on GM Financial's most recent\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nestimates and the number of units included in GM Financial Equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands):\nAs a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions in China, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value. Refer to the \"Overview – GMI\" section of this MD&A for discussion of the China market and associated restructuring actions being taken.\nConsolidated Results\nWe review changes in our results of operations under five categories: Volume, Mix, Price, Cost and Other. Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price and various sales allowances. Cost primarily includes: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. Other primarily includes foreign exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information.\nTotal Net Sales and Revenue\n\nIncludes $6.4 billion, $3.0 billion and $5.0 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 for purchases of, and collections on, wholesale finance receivables from GM which are eliminated within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIncludes $1.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and $1.7 billion in the year ended December 31, 2022 for dividends to GM which are eliminated within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to an increase in interest paid, a net decrease in cash provided by counterparty derivative collateral posting activities and an increase in acquisition costs related to vehicle protection contracts, partially offset by an increase in finance charge income.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.\nProduct Warranty and Recall Campaigns\nThe estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.\nWe accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nexperience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.4 billion.\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities i",
