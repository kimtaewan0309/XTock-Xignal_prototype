You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based only on information available to us at the time this statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nWe are a designer, developer, and operator of integrated resorts featuring luxury hotel rooms, high-end retail space, an array of dining and entertainment options, meeting and convention facilities, and gaming, all supported by an unparalleled focus on our guests, our people, and our community. Through our approximately 72% ownership of Wynn Macau, Limited (\"WML\"), our concessionaire Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A. (\"Wynn Macau SA\") operates two integrated resorts in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (\"Macau\"), Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau (collectively, our \"Macau Operations\"). In Las Vegas, Nevada, we operate and, with the exception of certain retail space, own 100% of Wynn Las Vegas. We are a 50.1% owner and managing member of a joint venture that owns and leases certain retail space at Wynn Las Vegas (the \"Retail Joint Venture\"). We refer to Wynn Las Vegas, Encore, an expansion at Wynn Las Vegas, and the Retail Joint Venture as our Las Vegas Operations. In Everett, Massachusetts, we operate Encore Boston Harbor, an integrated resort.\nThe Company has a 40% equity interest in Island 3 AMI FZ-LLC (\"Island 3\"), an unconsolidated affiliate, which is constructing an integrated resort property (\"Wynn Al Marjan Island\") in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates.\nKey Operating Measures\nCertain key operating measures specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations are presented. These key operating measures are presented as supplemental disclosures because management and/or certain investors use these measures to better understand period-over-period fluctuations in our casino and hotel operating revenues. These key operating measures are defined below:\nTable drop in mass market for our Macau Operations is the amount of cash that is deposited in a gaming table's drop box plus cash chips purchased at the casino cage.\nTable drop for our Las Vegas Operations is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.\nTable drop for Encore Boston Harbor is the amount of cash and gross markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.\nRolling chips are non-negotiable identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives within our Macau Operations' VIP program.\nTurnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our Macau Operations' VIP program.\nTable games win is the amount of table drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenues. Table games win is before discounts, commissions and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis. Table games win does not include poker rake.\nSlot machine win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenues. Slot machine win is after adjustment for progressive accruals and free play, but before discounts and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.\nPoker rake is the portion of cash wagered by patrons in our poker rooms that is retained by the casino as a service fee, after adjustment for progressive accruals, but before the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis. Poker tables are not included in our measure of average number of table games.\nAverage daily rate (\"ADR\") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms occupied.\nRevenue per available room (\"REVPAR\") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms available.\nOccupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available.\nBelow is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentages at our resorts.\nIn our mass market operations in Macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage. The measurements from our VIP and mass market operations are not comparable as the measurement method used in our mass market operations tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table and at the casino cage, while the measurement method from our VIP operations tracks the sum of all losing wagers. Accordingly, the base measurement from the VIP operations is much larger than the base measurement from the mass market operations. As a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is lower in the VIP operations when compared to the mass market operations.\nIn our VIP operations in Macau, customers primarily purchase rolling chips from the casino cage and can only use them to make wagers. Winning wagers are paid in cash chips. The loss of the rolling chips in the VIP operations is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating VIP win percentage. It is customary in Macau to measure VIP play using this rolling chip method. We typically expect our win as a percentage of turnover from these operations to be within the range of 3.1% to 3.4%.\nIn Las Vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables in exchange for cash and markers. Customers may then redeem markers at the gaming tables or at the casino cage. The cash and markers, net of redemptions, used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage. Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. Our expected table games win percentage is 22% to 26%.\nAt Encore Boston Harbor, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables in exchange for cash and markers. Customers may then redeem markers only at the casino cage. The cash and gross markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage. Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. Our expected table games win percentage is 18% to 2"
