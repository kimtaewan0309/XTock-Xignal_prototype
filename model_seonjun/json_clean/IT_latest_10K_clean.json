Through custom analysis and on-the-ground support we enable optimized technology investments and stronger performance on our clients’ mission critical priorities.\nMARKET OVERVIEW\nEnterprise leaders face enormous pressure to stay ahead and grow profitably amidst constant change. Whether it is a digital transformation, cybersecurity risk mitigation, supply chain disruptions, large-scale regulatory changes, or other unique challenges, business leaders today are facing significant disruptive changes. We believe that enterprises cannot be operationally effective unless they incorporate the right strategy, management and technology decisions into every part of their business. This requirement affects all executives in every major function, enterprise size, geography, industry and market sector. Executives and their teams turn to Gartner for actionable, objective insight that drives smarter decisions and stronger performance on their mission-critical priorities.\nOUR SOLUTION\nWe believe our combination of expert-led, practitioner-sourced and data-driven research steers clients toward the right decisions and actions on the issues that matter most. Organizations are overrun with data and information. Gartner helps eliminate this information chaos and provides clarity with actionable, objective insight. We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our differentiated intellectual capital. The foundation of our business model is our ability to create and distribute our proprietary research content as broadly as possible via published reports, interactive tools, facilitated peer networking, briefings and direct communications with executives and their teams; our conferences, including the Gartner Symposium/Xpo series; and consulting and advisory services.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nOur diversified business model provides multiple entry points and sources of value for our clients that lead to increased client spending on our research and advisory services, conferences and consulting services. A critical part of our long-term strategy is to increase business volume and penetration with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and insight. We also seek to extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client relationships, augment our sales capacity and expand into new markets around the world. These initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more effective packaging, campaigning and cross-\nselling of our products and services. In addition, we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of our products and services.\nOur principal products and services are delivered through our three business segments, as described below.\nRESEARCH.\nGartner delivers independent, objective insight to leaders across an enterprise through subscription services that include on-demand access to published research content, data and benchmarks, and direct access to a network of more than 2,500 research experts located around the globe. Gartner research is the fundamental building block for all Gartner products and services. We combine our proprietary research methodologies with extensive industry and academic relationships to create Gartner products and services that address each role across an enterprise. Within the Research segment, Global Technology Sales (“GTS”) sells products and services to users and providers of technology, while Global Business Sales (“GBS”) sells products and services to all other functional leaders, such as human resources, supply chain, finance, and marketing.\nOur research agenda is defined by clients’ needs, focusing on the critical issues, opportunities and challenges they face every day. We are in steady contact with close to 14,000 distinct client enterprises worldwide. We publish tens of thousands of pages of original research annually, and our research experts had more than 505,000 direct client interactions in 2024. Our size and scale enable us to commit vast resources toward broader and deeper research coverage and to deliver insight to our clients based on what they need and where they are. The ongoing interaction of our research experts with our clients enables us to identify the most pertinent topics to them and develop relevant product and service enhancements to meet the evolving needs of users of our research. Our proprietary research content, presented in the form of reports, briefings, updates and related tools, is delivered directly to the client’s computer or mobile device via our website and/or product-specific portals.\nClients normally sign subscription contracts that provide access to our research content and advisory services for individual users over a defined period. We typically have a minimum contract period of twelve months for our research and advisory subscription contracts and, at December 31, 2024, nearly 75% of our contracts were multi-year.\nCONFERENCES.\nGartner conferences are designed for information technology (\nIT”) and business executives as well as other decision makers looking to adapt and evolve their organizations through disruption and uncertainty, navigate risks and prioritize investments. Attendees experience sessions led by Gartner research experts, and the sessions include cutting-edge technology solutions, peer exchange workshops, one-on-one analyst and advisor meetings, consulting diagnostic workshops, keynotes and more. Our conferences also provide attendees with an opportunity to interact with IT and business executives from the world’s leading companies. In addition to role-specific summits and workshop-style seminars, Gartner hosts the Gartner Symposium/Xpo series, including its unique, flagship IT Symposium/Xpo\n, which is held at several locations worldwide annually. During 2024, Gartner successfully held 51 in-person conferences with more than 86,000 attendees, including nine Symposiums/Xpos. In addition, during 2024 we hosted 200+ peer networking meetings and 400+ exclusive local C-level meetings with more than 200 in-person.\nCONSULTING.\nThrough its experienced consultants, Gartner Consulting serves chief information officers and other senior executives who are driving technology-related strategic initiatives to optimize technology investments and drive business impact. Gartner Consulting combines the power of Gartner’s market-leading research with custom analysis and on-the-ground support to help clients to turn insight and advice into action and impact.\nConsulting solutions capitalize on Gartner assets that are invaluable to IT decision-making, including: (1) our extensive research, which ensures that our consulting analyses and advice are based on a deep understanding of the IT environment and the business of IT; (2) our market independence, which keeps our consultants focused on our clients’ success; and (3) our market-leading benchmarking capabilities, which provide relevant comparisons and best practices to assess and improve performance. Additionally, we provide actionable solutions for a range of IT-related priorities, including IT cost optimization, digital transformation and IT sourcing optimization.\nCOMPETITION\nWe believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are as follows:\nSuperior research content - We believe that we create the broadest, highest-quality and most relevant research coverage across all major functional roles in an enterprise. Our independent operating model and research analysis generates\nunbiased insight that we believe is timely, thought-provoking and comprehensive, and that is known for its high quality, independence and objectivity.\nOur leading brand name - We have provided critical, trusted insight under the Gartner name for more than 40 years.\nOur global footprint and established customer base - We have a global presence with clients in approximately 90 countries and territories on six continents. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the United States.\nInsight that creates connections - Our global community of experts, analysts and peers help provide the deep relationships that help clients stay ahead of the curve.\nExperienced management team - Our management team is comprised of research veterans and experienced industry executives with long tenure at Gartner.\nSubstantial operating leverage in our business model - We can distribute our intellectual property and expertise across multiple platforms, including research and advisory subscription and membership programs, conferences and consulting engagements, to derive incremental revenue and profitability.\nVast network of research experts and consultants - As of December 31, 2024, we had more than 2,500 research experts and 960 experienced consultants located around the world. Our research experts are located in more than 30 countries and territories, enabling us to cover vast aspects of business and technology on a global basis.\nNotwithstanding these differentiating factors, we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services. We compete indirectly with consulting firms and other data and information providers, including electronic and print media companies. These indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the internet. We anticipate encountering more competition with increased adoption of AI services in the markets in which we compete. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services. While we believe the breadth and depth of our research positions us well versus our competition, increased competition could result in loss of market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing, and increased sales and marketing expenditures.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. We have policies related to confidentiality, ownership, quote permission, and the use and protection of Gartner’s intellectual property. We also ente",

During 2024, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $0.7 billion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 — Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and, as such, they may ultimately differ materially from actual results. Ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.\n— Our revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:\nResearch revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products. The related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs are recognized when the leads are provided to vendors.\nConferences revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related conference or meeting.\nConsulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee or time and materials engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized as we work to satisfy our performance obligations. Revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization engagements are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment.\nThe majority of our Research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. Research contracts are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. Generally, it is our policy to record the amount of a subscription contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue because the contract represents a legally enforceable claim.\nNote 1 — Business and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9 — Revenue and Related Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information regarding our revenues.\nAccounting for income taxes\n— We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense or benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this assessment, we consider the availability of loss carryforwards, projected reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. Recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit with greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized. We use estimates in determining the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax law and measuring the benefits likely to be realized. Uncertain tax positions are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about their ultimate realization becomes available. In December 2024, we completed an intercompany transfer of certain intellectual property (IP). As a result, we recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $163.2 million, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The deferred tax asset represents the value of future tax deductions for amortization of the assets in the acquiring jurisdiction. The fair value of the intellectual property was determined using an income approach based on unobservable inputs and involves significant judgments such as, but not limited to, future cash flows and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nAccounting for stock-based compensation\n— We account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 and No. 110. We recognize stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period. Note 10 — Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding stock-based compensation. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards requires the use of certain subjective assumptions, including the expected life of a stock-based compensation award and our common stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate periodic stock-based compensation expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stock-based compensation awards and the related periodic expense represent management’s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if circumstances change and we deem it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions we made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of our stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock-based compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period.\nA change in any of the terms or conditions of stock-based compensation awards is accounted for as a modification of the award. Incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the awards at the modification date. For vested awards, we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. For unvested awards, we recognize any incremental compensation expense at the modification date or ratably over the requisite remaining service period, as appropriate. If the fair value of the modified award is lower than the fair value of the original award immediately before modification, the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results\nThe table below presents an analysis of selected line items and year-over-year changes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years indicated (in thousands).\n\nCost of services and product development\nSelling, general and administrative\nAmortization of intangibles\nAcquisition and integration charges\nGain from sale of divested operation\nInterest expense, net\nGain on event cancellation insurance claims\nLess: Provision for income taxes\nTotal revenues for 2024 were $6.3 billion, an increase of $360.5 million compared to 2023, or 6% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. The tables below present (i) revenues by geographic region (based on where the sale is fulfilled) and (ii) revenues by segment for the years indicated (in thousands).\nPrimary Geographic Market\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nUnited States and Canada\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nRefer to the section of this MD&A below entitled “Segment Results” for a discussion of revenues and results by segment.\nCost of services and product development was $2.0 billion in 2024, an increase of $119.8 million compared to 2023, or 6% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. The increase in Cost of services and product development was primarily due to a $82.8 million increase in personnel expenses associated with headcount and merit increases as well a $37.0 million increase in conference expenses due to an increase in the number of conferences. Cost of services and product development as a percent of revenues was 32% for both 2024 and 2023.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense was $2.9 billion in 2024, an increase of $183.3 million compared to 2023, or 7% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. The increase in SG&A during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of a $165.4 million increase in personnel expenses due to increased headcount and merit increases.\nThe number of quota-bearing sales associates in Global Technology Sales increased by 4% to 3,804 and in Global Business Sales increased by 9% to 1,298, compared to December 31, 2023. On a combined basis, the total number of quota-bearing sales associates increased by 6% when compared to December 31, 2023. SG&A expense as a percent of revenues was 46% during both 2024 and 2023.\nDepreciation increased by 14% during 2024 compared to 2023. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to increased software additions during the last twelve months.\nAmortization of intangibles decreased by 2% during 2024 compared to 2023.\nAcquisition and integration charges decreased by $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.\nGain from sale of divested operation during the prior year was attributable to the sale of our TalentNeuron business in February 2023. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $135.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOperating income was $1.16 billion and $1.24 billion during 2024 and 2023, respectively.\ndecrease in operating income\nwas primarily due to the gain from sale of divested operation recognized during the prior year period, and increases in cost of services and product development and selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased revenue.\nInterest expense, net decreased by $24.8 million during 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease in interest expense, net was due to increased interest income, primarily as a result of higher cash balances than the prior year.\nGain on event cancellation insurance claims of $300.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 reflected proceeds from a settlement agreement to resolve litigation concerning the Company's event cancellation insurance for 2020 and 2021. The settlement resolved all remaining 2020 and 2021 event cancellation insurance claims. Gain on event cancellation insurance claims of $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 reflected proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellation insurance claims.\nOther income, net for the years presented herein included the net impact of foreign currency gains and losses from our hedging activities, as well as sales of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives. During both 2024 and 2023, Other income, net included a $3.9 million gain on de-designated interest rate swaps.\nProvision for income taxes was $133.7 million and $264.7 million during 2024 and 2023, respectively, with an effective income tax rate of 9.6% and 23.1% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2024 was primarily the result of net tax benefits of approximately $161.9 million recognized as a result of an intercompany transfer of certain intellectual property in December 2024. Note 12 — Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding the Company’s income taxes.\nNet income was $1.3 billion and $882.5 million during 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, our diluted net income per share increased by $4.92 in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in net income during 2024 was primarily due to the gain on event cancellation insurance claims, as well as an increase in revenue and lower provision for income taxes and interest expense, net, partially offset by the gain from sale of divested operation recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 and increased operating expenses.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nWe evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin.
