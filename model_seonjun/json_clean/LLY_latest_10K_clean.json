We adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs and comply with local regulations.\nU.S.\nWe educate healthcare providers about our products in various ways, including promoting in online channels, distributing literature and samples of certain products to physicians, and exhibiting at medical meetings. In addition, we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the U.S., and we maintain websites and other media channels (e.g., social media) with information about our major products. Promotion of our major products in the U.S. includes engagement by employee or contracted sales representatives with physicians and other healthcare professionals.\nOur account managers service wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, government and long-term care institutions, hospitals, and certain retail pharmacies. We enter into arrangements with these organizations to provide discounts or rebates on our products.\nIn the U.S., most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other healthcare professionals, and hospitals. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, three wholesale distributors in the U.S.—McKesson Corporation, Cencora, Inc., and Cardinal Health, Inc.—each accounted for a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these years. For additional information, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2: Revenue.\"\nWe recently launched LillyDirect, a direct-to-consumer digital health care platform designed to, among other things, provide patients in the U.S. living with obesity, migraine and diabetes with tools to help them access care from independent healthcare providers, as well as the option for home delivery of select prescribed Lilly medicines through third-party pharmacies. Programs to assist patients in adhering to treatment plans are also available for use. We have launched, and continue to explore, new partnerships and tools, including through LillyDirect, to expand access to our medicines. New initiatives may expose us to new risks or exacerbate existing risks. See, for examples, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Operations—Failure, inadequacy, breach of, or unauthorized access to, our IT systems or those of our third-party service providers, unauthorized access to our confidential information, or violations of data protection laws, could each result in material harm to our\nbusiness and reputation\" and \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Litigation and Government Regulation—Regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company.\"\nThe products we market and their distribution vary from country to country. Outside the U.S., we promote our products to healthcare providers through sales representatives and other channels. We maintain our own sales organizations in many countries. We also often utilize third parties for commercial sales operations, some of which are engaged through distribution and promotion arrangements.\nMarketing Collaborations\nCertain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. For example, we and Boehringer Ingelheim have a global agreement to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products, including Jardiance, Glyxambi, Synjardy, and Trijardy XR.\nFor additional information, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4: Collaborations and Other Arrangements.\"\nOur products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets.\nImportant competitive factors include effectiveness, safety, availability, ease of use, and overall patient experience; formulary placement, price, payer coverage and reimbursement rates, and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; regulatory approvals; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products, processes, modalities, indications, and uses. Early market entry and rapid patient access can also be important to achieve product acceptance and success. Barriers to reimbursable patient access in some cases include default payer coverage restrictions for our medicines. For example, in the U.S., anti-obesity medicines are often excluded from commercial benefit plans. Self-insured employers must opt in for coverage of these medicines. Medicare and payers in various international markets also have not covered anti-obesity medicines for weight loss. Our anti-obesity medicines comprise a significant portion of our revenues, and barriers to reimbursable patient access may impact our sales volumes, business, and results of operations.\nMost new products or uses that we introduce must compete with other branded, biosimilar, or generic products already on the market or that are later developed. When new products, uses, or delivery systems with therapeutic, conv",

There is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discovery and development. To bring a product from the discovery phase to market takes considerable time and entails significant cost. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies,\" for additional information.\nWe manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines and indications. A delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by pre-clinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.\nWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings.\nSee Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings currently pending regarding certain of our patents.\nSee Item 1, \"Business—Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights,\" for a discussion of the impacts of trends involving intellectual property on our business and results.\nTrends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access and Certain Other Regulatory Developments\nReforms, including those that may stem from political initiatives, periods of uneven economic growth or downturns, or as a result of inflation or deflation, the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts, or government budgeting priorities, are expected to continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.\nGlobal concern over access to, and affordability of, pharmaceutical products continues to drive regulatory and legislative debate and action, as well as cost containment efforts by governmental authorities. Such measures include the use of mandated discounts, price reporting requirements, mandated reference prices, restrictive formularies, changes to available intellectual property protections, as well as other efforts. In 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices apply beginning at nine years (for medicines approved under a New Drug Application) or thirteen years (for medicines approved under a Biologics License Application) following FDA approval or licensure for the molecule and are set at a price that generally represents a significant discount from existing prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. While the law specifies a maximum price that HHS can set, it does not set a minimum price. The Medicare price HHS determines may impact the product's best price determination under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, potentially leading to a negative impact on both Medicaid and 340B prices. In August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to government-set prices effective in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the government-set prices for these medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Given our product portfolio, we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to expiry of exclusivities. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\nOther IRA provisions require drug manufacturers to provide rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D medicines under certain circumstances. Also, on January 1, 2025, the Part D benefit redesign replaced the Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program with a new manufacturer discount program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant.\nThe IRA has, and will continue to, meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under a New Drug Application reduces the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The IRA can cause changes to development approach and timing and investments at-risk. The full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\nAdditional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by lawmakers, regulators, and other authorities in the U.S. and worldwide, could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example, the U.S. House of Representatives recently passed the BIOSECURE Act, which is under consideration in the U.S. Senate. This legislation, if passed, could affect elements of the pharmaceutical supply chain; although as currently drafted we do not anticipate the bill would have a material impact on our business.\nConsolidation and integration of private payers and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S. has also significantly impacted the market for pharmaceuticals by increasing payer leverage in negotiating manufacturer price or rebate concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates. Furthermore, restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory agencies, courts, or private payers may adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. We expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, we are engaged in litigation and investigations related to the 340B program, access to insulin, pricing, product safety, and other matters that, if resolved adversely to us, could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the overall potential adverse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide.\nIn addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, quality assurance, safety signals, evolving standards, and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, inability to realize the benefit of capital expenditures, or delays or denials in new product approvals, line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues, or other negative impacts, any of which result in reputational harm or adversely affect our business.\nSee Item 1, \"Business—Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access,\" Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAt various times during 2024, demand for our incretin medicines exceeded production. Supply and channel dynamics have also contributed to variability in quarter-over-quarter revenue growth rates for tirzepatide. Tirzepatide supply currently exceeds demand in the U.S. Demand in launched markets remains dynamic, and increases or changes in demand, by dose or overall, as well as the complex supply chain, may result in periodic unavailability of certain presentations and dose levels at certain locations even when total tirzepatide supply can meet demand. Supply considerations will continue to influence the timing and approach (including available presentations) of tirzepatide launches in new markets. We continue to expand manufacturing capacity and progress efforts to bring tirzepatide to patients via different delivery presentations, such as single-use vials and multi-use pens. Production increases will continue, and additional capacity is expected to be operational over the next several years.\nWe have seen an increase in the production, marketing, and sale of counterfeit, misbranded, adulterated, and compounded incretins. These practices may impact patient safety and undermine regulatory drug approval processes. Lilly will continue to consider all options, including filing lawsuits where appropriate, to address unlawful practices and the patient safety risks of unapproved, untested, and manipulated drugs.\nSee Item 1, \"Business—Government Regulation of Our Operations and Products” and Item 1A, \"Risk —Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We and our products face intense competition, including from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business,\" for additional information.\nWe are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore, changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows. The U.S. and countries around the world are actively proposing and enacting tax law changes. Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate. Tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are expected to",
