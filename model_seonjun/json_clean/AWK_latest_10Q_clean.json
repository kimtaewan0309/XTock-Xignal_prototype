Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 27, 2024, and became effective January 1, 2025.\nVirginia passed Senate Bill 850, which would permit a water or wastewater utility to petition the VSCC for the approval of an eligible infrastructure replacement and enhancement plan and accompanying recovery mechanism that allows for recovery of eligible infrastructure costs outside of a base rate case. Legislation was signed by the Governor on March 24, 2025, and became effective on July 1, 2025.\nIndiana passed Senate Bill 426, which changes the timing of recovery to allow for deferred depreciation from in-service date and post in-service carrying costs and authorizes the IURC to approve mechanisms to allow utilities to invest in and earn on acquired utility assets. The language also provides critical protections from lawsuits when utilities are meeting applicable water quality standards. Legislation was signed by the Governor on April 3, 2025, and became effective on July 1, 2025.\nMissouri passed Senate Bill 4, which provides that beginning July 1, 2026, water, sewer, and gas utilities may request the use of a future test year in a general rate case. This statute provides that at the end of the future test year, utilities must reconcile rate base and certain expenses, including annualized depreciation expense, income tax expense, payroll expense, employee benefits except for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and rate case expenses, within 45 days to the MoPSC. Legislation was signed by the Governor on April 9, 2025, and became effective on August 28, 2025.\nCondemnation and Eminent Domain\nAll or portions of the Regulated Businesses’ utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original certificate of public convenience and necessity (“CPCN”) was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its CPCN. The acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or the jurisdiction of the particular CPCN.\nAs such, the Regulated Businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, the Monterey system assets of Cal Am are the subject of a condemnation lawsuit filed by the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”) stemming from a November 2018 public ballot initiative. For more information on this matter, see Part II, Item 1—Legal Proceedings—Proposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets — Potential Condemnation and Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFurthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which the Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, for example, lawsuits have been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates, but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBB”) was signed into law. The OBBB includes several corporate tax-related provisions. Key changes include the permanent extension of certain provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, such as 100% bonus depreciation and Section 163(j) interest limitation exception for regulated utilities, as well as the immediate expensing of domestic research and development costs, and the introduction of a new charitable contribution floor for corporations. The OBBB has not had a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company will continue to monitor the implementation and any related guidance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are generally funded through cash flows from operations, public and private debt offerings, issuances of commercial paper and equity and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the revolving credit facility of American Water Capital Corp., the Company’s wholly owned finance subsidiary.\nThe Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows from operating activities, the Company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next five years through a combination of long-term debt and equity issuances, in addition to the remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS. The remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS include receipt of payments under a secured seller promissory note, plus interest, see Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures—Secured Seller Promissory Note from the Sale of Homeowner Services Group, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.\nIn August 2025, the Company entered into separate forward sale agreements (the “Forward Sale Agreements”) with several forward purchasers relating to an aggregate of 8,098,592 shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial forward price of $139.657 per share, which is equal to the price to public per share less an underwriting discount. Each Forward Sale Agreement will be physically settled unless the Company elects to settle such Forward Sale Agreement in cash or to net share settle such Forward Sale Agreement (which the Company has the right to do, subject to certain conditions, other than in the limited circumstances set forth in the Forward Sale Agreements). The Forward Sale Agreements provide for settlement on a settlement date or dates to be specified at the Company’s discretion on or prior to December 31, 2026. To the extent the Forward Sale Agreements are physically settled, the Company will issue common stock to the forward purchasers and receive cash proceeds based on the applicable forward sale price on the settlement date as defined in the Forward Sale Agreements.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of its common stock connected to the Forward Sale Agreements. The Company estimates that it will receive total net proceeds of approximately $1,131 million, before deducting estimated offering expenses, subject to the price adjustment and other provisions of the Forward Sale Agreements, in the event of full physical settlement of all of the Forward Sale Agreements. The Company intends to use any net cash proceeds that it may receive upon a settlement of the Forward Sale Agreements for general corporate purposes. The Forward Sale Agreements will be classified as equity transactions because they are indexed to the Company’s common stock and physical settlement is within the Company’s control.\nOn August 8, 2025, AWCC completed the sale of $900 millio"
