Our forward-looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events, including projections of earnings and other financial performance measures, statements of management’s expectations regarding our strategic, operational and capital allocation plans and objectives, management’s views on industry, economic, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions and other forecasts of trends and other matters. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this filing, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise such statements to reflect new circumstances or unanticipated events as they occur. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “will,” “outlook,” “project,” “may,” “can,” “plan,” “target,” “potential,” “should” and other words and expressions of similar meaning.\nOVERVIEW\nThird quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to the third quarter\n\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\nOur business is seasonal. In general, sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters, which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and irrigation and landscape installations and maintenance. Sales are lower during the first and fourth quarters. In 2024, we generated approximately 60% of our net sales and 73% of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year.\nWe typically experience a build-up of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season. Excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases, our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter, primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in April, May and June, while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in June, July and August.\nThe following table presents certain unaudited quarterly income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to illustrate seasonal fluctuations in these amounts. We believe this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data. The results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing future trends for a variety of reasons, including the seasonal nature of our business and the impact of new and acquired sales centers.\n\nTemperatures in the third quarter of 2025 were above average in several regions, including the Northwest, Midwest, South and Western regions. Localized flooding occurred early in the quarter, followed by drought conditions across the Central and Western regions. In the third quarter of 2024, temperatures were slightly warmer than the third quarter of 2025, and there were more variable weather conditions in the third quarter of 2024 with several notable weather events. Overall, weather conditions did not significantly impact our sales results for the third quarter of 2025.\nWeather conditions in the second quarter of 2025 were generally marked by above-average temperatures and higher-than-normal precipitation. Warm conditions generally supported seasonal trends, though localized disruptions occurred due to severe storms, flash flooding and tornado outbreaks, particularly in April and May. Around mid-June, we observed intense heat across many regions, further supporting demand in key markets. Overall, while weather patterns were variable, we believe that the net impact on our results was broadly neutral. In the second quarter of 2024, weather across the U.S. was mixed, with wetter conditions in the central regions and Texas, drier conditions in the West, and warmer-than-average temperatures, especially in June, supporting maintenance activities and leading to varied impacts across our markets.\nWeather conditions in the first quarter of 2025 were mixed across our key markets. Early January snowstorms and overall cooler temperatures through much of February negatively impacted early season sales activity. While March brought warmer and drier weather, these improvements provided only partial relief to our sales trends and were insufficient to offset the slower start to the quarter. During the first quarter of 2024, above-average temperatures in some regions, including California, contributed positively to economic activities. However, the adverse effects of cooler and wetter weather in Florida and the Southeast, and excessive precipitation in Texas and the Northeast, outweighed the positives, resulting in an overall unfavorable impact on net sales.\n\nInterest and Other Non-Operating Expenses, Net\nInterest and other non-operating expenses, net for the third quarter of 2025 decreased $0.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2024. Our weighted average effective interest rate decreased to 4.5% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 5.2% in the third quarter of 2024 on average outstanding debt of $1.1 billion and $946.1 million for the respective periods.\nOur effective income tax rate was 23.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 23.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded a $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, tax benefit from ASU 2016-09 in the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to a benefit of $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Without the benefit from ASU 2016-09 in both periods, our effective tax rate was 23.7% in both the third quarter of 2025 and the third quarter of 2024. Our third quarter effective income tax rate is historically lower compared to other quarters due to the annual expiration of statutes of limitations in the various jurisdictions where we have recorded uncertain tax positions.\n\nNet sales for the first nine months of 2025 remained consistent with net sales for the same period last year. Despite ongoing macroeconomic constraints in the first nine months of 2025, non-discretionary spending remained steady, while discretionary activities improved sequentially. In the first quarter of the year, discretionary projects remained pressured from macroeconomic conditions and unfavorable weather. In the second quarter of 2025, we saw sales expansion compared to the second quarter of 2024 and discretionary activities were less of a drag on overall sales. Net sales also increased in the third quarter of 2025 from the third quarter of 2024, supported by price, sustained demand for maintenance products and growth in sales of building materials products from the same period of the prior year.\nThe following factors impacted our sales in the first nine months of 2025 and are listed in order of estimated magnitude:\nstable maintenance product sales;\nlower sales volume of products used in pool construction and discretionary activities (see discussion below); and\na benefit of approximately 2% from inflationary product cost increases, net of price deflation on some items, compared to a 1% benefit in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nOur Credit Facility, as recently amended, provides for $1.3 billion in borrowing capacity consisting of an $800.0 million revolving credit facility and a $500.0 million term loan facility. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature permitting us to request one or more incremental term loans or revolving credit facility commitment increases up to $250.0 million and sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit. We pay interest on revolving and term loan borrowings under the Credit Facility at a variable rate based on the one-month Term SOFR, plus an applicable margin. The term loan requires quarterly amortization payments commencing on September 30, 2027, with all remaining principal due on September 30, 2029. We intend to continue to use the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, for future share repurchases and to fund future growth initiatives.\nAt September 30, 2025, there was $221.3 million of revolving borrowings outstanding, a $500.0 million term loan outstanding, $14.4 million of standby letters of credit outstanding and $564.3 million available for borrowing. The weighted average effective interest rate for the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2025 was approximately 3.8%, excluding commitment fees and including the impact of our interest rates swaps.\n\nFinancial covenants of the Credit Facility, Term Facility and Receivables Facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which are our most restrictive financial covenants. As of September 30, 2025, the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below:\nMaximum Average Total Leverage Ratio\n. On the last day of each fiscal quarter, our average total leverage ratio must be less than 3.25 to 1.00. Average Total Leverage Ratio is the ratio of the sum of (i) Total Non-Revolving Funded Indebtedness as of such date, (ii) the trailing twelve months (TTM) Average Total Revolving Funded Indebtedness and (iii) the TTM Average Accounts Securitization Proceeds divided by TTM EBITDA (as those terms are defined in the Credit Facility). As of September 30, 2025, our average total leverage ratio equaled 1.58 (compared to 1.47 as of June 30, 2025) and the TTM average total indebtedness amount used in this calculation was $1.0 billion.\nMinimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\n. On the last day of each fiscal quarter, our fixed charge ratio must be greater than or equal to 2.25 to 1.00. Fixed Charge Ratio is the ratio of the TTM EBITDAR divided by TTM Interest Expense paid or payable in cash plus TTM Rental Expense (as those terms are defined in the Credit Fac"
