  "item2_clean": "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc. is one of the world’s leading manufacturers, marketers and sellers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. We are a steward of over 20 luxury and prestige brands globally. Our products are sold in approximately 150 countries and territories. We operate as a wholesaler, with our products sold in brick-and-mortar locations and on various e-commerce platforms, including those operated by department stores, duty-free retailers, specialty-multi retailers, online pure players, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies, and top-tier salons and spas. Additionally, we operate a direct-to-consumer business across freestanding stores, our brands' websites and third-party online platforms.\nSelling, general and administrative\nRestructuring and other charges\nTalcum litigation settlement agreements\nTotal operating expenses\nOperating income (loss)\nInterest income and investment income, net\nOther components of net periodic benefit cost\nEarnings (loss) before income taxes\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nNot adjusted for differences caused by rounding\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nThe following table is a comparative summary of operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, for our product categories and geographic regions and reflects the basis of presentation described in\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNote 13 – Segment Data\n, for our product categories that meet the definition of reportable segments, for all periods presented. Royalty revenue from license arrangements, and products and services that do not fit within our definitions of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the “other” category.\nNET SALES\nBy Product Category:\nReturns associated with restructuring and other activities\nBy Geographic Region\nEurope, United Kingdom and Ireland and Emerging Markets (\"EUKEM\")\nReturns associated with restructuring and other activities\nOPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\nBy Product Category:\nCharges associated with restructuring and other activities\nOperating income (loss)\nBy Geographic Region\nEUKEM\nCharges associated with restructuring and other activities\nOperating income (loss)\nThe net sales and operating results from the Company’s travel retail business are included in the Asia/Pacific region.\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nPeriod-over-period changes in our net sales are generally attributable to the impacts from (i) pricing on our base portfolio, including changes in mix and those due to strategic pricing actions, (ii) volume, including changes driven by the impact of new product innovation, (iii) acquisitions and/or divestitures, and/or (iv) foreign currency translation. The percentages disclosed for these impacts are calculated on an individual basis.\nThe net sales impact from pricing consists of changes in list prices, due to strategic pricing actions, and mix shifts within and among product categories, geographic regions, brands and distribution channels. The prices at which we sell our products vary by brand, distribution channel (e.g., wholesale or direct-to-consumer) and may also vary by country. Our brands and products cover a broad array of pricing tiers. Prices of skin care and fragrance products are typically higher than makeup and hair care products.\nNew product innovation includes the introduction of new products, as well as changes related to existing products or where they are sold, including reformulations, regional expansion, repackaging and sets. A product is considered \"new innovation\" for the twelve-month period following the initial shipment date. Our innovation is launched at different price points than existing products and value derived from innovation may vary from year to year. We continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives. The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period. The introduction of new products often has some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. The impact of new product introductions, including timing compared to introductions in prior periods, also affects our results.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods. While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. See\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nbeginning on page 46 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nWe operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our results of operations. Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings (loss) per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant currency information by translating current-period results using prior-year monthly average foreign currency exchange rates and adjusting for the period-over-period impact of foreign currency cash flow hedging activities.\nWe have experienced challenges within our business and we expect volatility and uncertainty to continue. Although there are signs of stabilization in Mainland China, travel retail conversion continues to be weak and challenges persist in Western Europe, including subdued sentiment. Additionally, within the United States we continue to experience headwinds from challenges in department stores. These challenges are collectively expected to impact net sales and profitability, including impacts to our effective tax rate from changes to our geographical mix of earnings.\nWe are continuing to monitor and assess the potential effects of new and existing tariffs in the United States as well as in other markets in which we operate. These tariffs have led to significant volatility and uncertainty in global markets and difficulty in forecasting demand. We have implemented and are continuing to implement and consider additional mitigation measures. The impact was not material to fiscal 2026 first quarter profitability and cash flows, however, even if we can minimize some of these impacts, we anticipate higher tariff rates to have an adverse effect on fiscal 2026 profitability and cash flows, and depending on actual rates and countries imposing tariffs such adverse impacts could be material.\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nWe continue to believe that the best way to increase long-term stockholder value is to provide superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing shifts in consumers’ behaviors and shopping practices. Accordingly, our long-term strategy has numerous initiatives across product categories, brands, geographic regions, channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths, such as our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications, and make us more productive and profitable. With the transition of leadership in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2025, we have embarked on \"Beauty Reimagined,\" a strategic vision which focuses on accelerating best-in-class consumer coverage, creating transformative innovation, boosting consumer-facing investments, fueling sustainable growth through bold efficiencies and reimagining the way we work, including through the expansion of the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan (\"PRGP\"), as discussed below.\nWe continue to monitor the effects of the global macro environment, including the risk of recession; currency volatility; inflationary pressures; supply chain challenges; social and political issues; competitive pressures; legal and regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs and sanctions; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues. We are also mindful of inflationary pressures (including those caused by tariffs) on our cost base and are monitoring the impact on consumer preferences, the impact of changes being made in the organization, including those related to Beauty Reimagined and the PRGP, as well as the potential impact of changes expected to be made as part of the PRGP on suppliers, retailers and others, and challenges relating to successfully outsourcing select services. In our outlook, we have made assumptions relating to these and other internal and external factors and challenges. Declines in net sales and profitability have, and may continue to, adversely impact the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our brands, as well as long-lived assets, potentially resulting in impairments.\nIn December 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued \"Pillar Two\" Global Anti-Base Erosion model rules for countries to enact into domestic law that wo"
