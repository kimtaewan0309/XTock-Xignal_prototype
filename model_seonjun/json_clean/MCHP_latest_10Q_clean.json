overall business strategy to provide an overview of the goals and overall direction of our business. This is followed by a discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then discuss our Results of Operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial commitments in the section titled \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nBusiness and Macroeconomic Environment\nDuring most of fiscal 2025, our overall business was weak as we navigated through a large inventory correction. However, in the first half of fiscal 2026, we saw a significant improvement in our overall business compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nSix Months Ended September 30,\nThe decreases in net sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to many customers having high levels of inventory and delaying or reducing orders and, to a lesser extent, adverse economic conditions, including slow economic activity, business uncertainty, persistent inflation and high interest rates. Due to the size, complexity and diversity of our customer base, we are not able to quantify any material factor contributing to the changes in net sales. See "
