These changes do not impact our PBNA segment.\nInternationally, the foods businesses in LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC will be reorganized into three reportable segments: Latin America Foods, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Other International Foods. Other International Foods will include the foods businesses in APAC and India, currently part of AMESA.\nOur international franchise beverage businesses that were part of our LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC segments will be reported as International Beverages Franchise.\nThe company-owned bottling businesses operating internationally are all located within EMEA and will be reported in the newly created EMEA segment.\nOur historical segment reporting will be recast beginning first quarter 2025 to reflect the new organizational structure.\nOur Distribution Network\nOur products are primarily brought to market through DSD, customer warehouse and distributor networks and are also sold directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms and retailers. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.\nDirect-Store-Delivery\nWe, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages and convenient foods directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.\nSome of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party operated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover.\nDistributor Networks\nWe distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.\nOur products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.\nIngredients and Other Supplies\nThe principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are acesulfame potassium, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, juice concentrates, nuts, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential ",

These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and the effective net pricing.\nQFNA\nNet revenue decreased 14%, primarily driven by a decrease in organic volume, which was negatively impacted by the loss of sales from products included in the Quaker Recall.\nUnit volume declined 14%, primarily driven by double-digit declines in bars, oatmeal, pancake syrup and mix and ready-to-eat cereals. The unit volume decline in bars and ready-to-eat cereals was negatively impacted by the loss of sales from products included in the Quaker Recall.\nOperating profit decreased 38%, primarily reflecting the decrease in organic volume, certain operating cost increases and a 14-percentage-point impact of charges associated with the Quaker Recall, partially offset by productivity savings, a 12-percentage-point favorable impact of an insurance recovery related to the Quaker Recall, lower advertising and marketing expenses and effective net pricing.\nPBNA\nNet revenue increased 0.5%, primarily driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by an organic volume decline.\nUnit volume declined 3%, driven by a 4% decline in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume and a 2% decline in CSD volume. The NCB volume decline primarily reflected a mid-single-digit decline in our overall water portfolio, a low-single-digit decline in Gatorade sports drinks and a high-single-digit decline in our Lipton ready-to-drink tea portfolio.\nOperating profit decreased 11%, primarily driven by certain operating cost increases, the decline in organic volume, a 9-percentage-point impact of higher impairment and other charges associated with our TBG investment and Juice Transaction-related receivables, a 7-percentage-point impact of higher restructuring charges and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings.\nNet revenue increased 0.5%, reflecting effective net pricing, partially offset by a 3-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange translation and a net decline in organic volume.\nConvenient foods unit volume declined 2%, primarily reflecting double-digit declines in Peru and Argentina, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in Brazil.

These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and the unfavorable net pricing.\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nCost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, impairment of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/income, net interest expense and other, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates\nThese measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan (2019 Productivity Plan), charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, impairment and other charges/credits, product recall-related impact, indirect tax expense related to an international audit and the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share\ndiluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.\nOrganic revenue performance\nWe define organic revenue performance as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and every five or six years, the impact of the 53\nreporting week. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. We believe organic revenue performance provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.\nSee “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Performance” in “Results of Operations\nDivision Review” for further information.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.\nSee “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability\nWe define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.\nWe believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.\nSee “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.\nItems Affecting Comparability\n\nSee “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.\nOperating profit increased 8% and operating margin improved 0.9 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by effective net pricing, productivity savings and an 18-percentage-point impact of prior-year impairment charges related to the SodaStream business. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a decline in organic volume, an 8-percentage-point impact of higher impairment and other charges associated with our TBG investment and Juice Transaction-related receivables, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher restructuring charges and a 4-percentage-point unfavorable impact of an indirect tax reserve. Corporate unallocated expenses reflect a 3-percentage-point favorable impact driven primarily by a decrease in corporate expenses and prior-year contributions to The PepsiCo Foundation, Inc.\nOther Consolidated Results\n\nItem 7.
