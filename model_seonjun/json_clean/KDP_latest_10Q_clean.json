On August 25, 2025, Moody's placed KDP ratings under review for downgrade, and S&P has placed KDP on CreditWatch Negative.\nThese debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements. A downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations.\nPrincipal Uses of Capital Resources\nOur capital allocation priorities are investing to grow our business both organically and inorganically, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders through regular quarterly dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. We dynamically adjust our cash deployment plans based on the specific opportunities available in a given period, but over time we allocate capital to balance each of these priorities.\nRegular Quarterly Dividends\nWe have declared total dividends of $0.69 per share and $0.66 per share for the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nRepurchases of Common Stock\nOur Board authorized a four-year share repurchase program, ending December 31, 2025, of up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock. We did not repurchase any common stock during the first nine months of 2025. As of September 30, 2025, $1,810 million\nremained available for repurchase under the authorized share repurchase program.\nCapital Expenditures\nPurchases of property, plant, and equipment were $338 million and $398 million for the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nCapital expenditures, which includes both purchases of property, plant, and equipment and amounts included in accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily related to investments in manufacturing capabilities, both in the U.S. and internationally, for the first nine months of 2025 and 2024. Capital expenditures included in accounts payable and accrued expenses were $151 million and $164 million for the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively, which primarily related to these investments.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\nFrom time to time, we expect to invest in beverage startup companies or in brand ownership companies to grow our presence in certain product categories, or enter into various licensing and distribution agreements to expand our product portfolio. Our investments may involve acquiring a minority interest in equity securities of a company, in certain cases with a protected path to ownership at our future option.\nAcquisitions of Businesses and Purchases of Intangible Assets\nWe have invested in the expansion of our distribution network through transactions with strategic independent bottlers or third-party brand ownership companies to ensure competitive distribution scale. Additionally, from time to time, we acquire brand ownership companies to expand our portfolio. These transactions could be accounted for either as an acquisition of a business or as an asset acquisition, if the majority of the transaction price represents the acquisition of a single intangible asset. In the second quarter of 2025, we completed the Dyla acquisition. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Purchases of intangible assets were $16 million and $49 million for the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nUncertainties and Trends Affecting Liquidity\nDisruptions in financial and credit markets, including those caused by inflation, global economic uncertainty or economic downturns, fluctuations in interest rates, or the imposition of new tariffs or changes to existing tariffs, trade wars, barriers or restrictions, or threats of such actions, and related uncertainty, may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors, and may also impact our ability to access liquidity through financial markets in a timely and cost-effective manner. These disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials.\nCustomer and consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by the risk factors discussed under \"Risk Factors\" in Part 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report, as well as subsequent filings with the SEC, that could have a material effect on production, delivery, and consumption of our products, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume.\nRefer to \"Risk Factors\" in Part II, Item 1A below for additional risks and uncertainties related to the JDE Peet's Acquisition.\nSUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries (the \"Guarantors\"), as defined in the indentures governing the Notes. The Guarantors are 100% owned either directly or indirectly by us and jointly and severally guarantee, subject to the release provisions described below, our obligations under the Notes. None of our subsidiaries organized outside of the U.S., any of the subsidiaries held by Maple Parent Holdings Corp. prior to the DPS Merger, or any of the subsidiaries acquired after the DPS Merger (collectively, the \"Non-Guarantors\") guarantee the Notes. The subsidiary guarantees with respect to the Notes are subject to release upon the occurrence of certain events, including the sale of all or substantially all of a subsidiary's assets, the release of the subsidiary's guarantee of our other indebtedness, our exercise of the legal defeasance option with respect to the Notes, and the discharge of our obligations under the applicable indenture.\nThe following schedules present the summarized financial information for Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (the \"Parent\") and the Guarantors on a combined basis after intercompany eliminations; the Parent and the Guarantors' amounts due from and amounts due to Non-Guarantors are disclosed separately. The consolidating schedules are provided in accordance with the reporting requirements of Rule 13-01 under SEC Regulation S-X for the issuer and guarantor subsidiaries.\nSummarized financial information for the Parent and Guarantors follows:\nFirst Nine Months of 2025\n\nItem 2.
