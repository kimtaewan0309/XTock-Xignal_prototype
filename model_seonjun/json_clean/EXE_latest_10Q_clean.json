Additionally, in March 2025, we redeemed the remaining $47 million aggregate principal of the 2026 Notes with cash on hand. During the Current Period, we redeemed approximately $103 million of our 6.750% Senior Notes due 2029, approximately $60 million of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2029 and approximately $62 million of our 5.375% Senior Notes due 2029 through open market repurchases using cash on hand. See\nof the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion.\nRepurchase Program and Enhanced Returns Framework\nIn October 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $1.0 billion, in aggregate, of the Company’s common stock and/or warrants. Additionally, we announced our enhanced capital returns framework which is designed to more effectively return cash to shareholders and reduce net debt. Our enhanced capital returns framework prioritizes paying the base dividend of $2.30 per share and $1.0 billion of annual net debt reduction in 2025, with 75% of any remaining free cash flow distributed, as market conditions warrant, through share repurchases and additional dividend payments. During the Current Period, we repurchased 0.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $100 million.\nEconomic and Market Conditions\nGeopolitical risk and policy uncertainty continue to drive volatility in natural gas, oil and NGL prices, while macroeconomic headwinds in key consuming countries could impact global growth prospects, potentially affecting supply and demand for energy commodities. Domestically, the natural gas market balance continued to loosen modestly during the third quarter as robust production, reduced demand, and seasonal consumption patterns offset increasing structural demand gains from LNG and industrials, putting downward pressure on near-term pricing. Our future estimated cash flow is partially protected from commodity price volatility due to our current hedge positions that provide a floor price on approximately half of our projected gas volumes through the end of 2026 with significant upside participation via costless collars. For the foreseeable future, we believe our operational flexibility, cost structure and liquidity position will enable us to successfully navigate continued price volatility.\nWe continue to monitor factors impacting commodity supply and demand situations, including tariffs on steel, and assess their impact on our business, including business partners and customers. As part of the Southwestern Merger, we assumed Southwestern’s oilfield service business that will allow for some vertical integration of our exploration and production operations, which may help to control costs and secure inputs for our operations. For additional discussion regarding risk associated with price volatility and economic uncertainty, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of capital resources and liquidity are internally generated cash flows from operations and borrowings under our 2025 Credit Facility, and our primary uses of cash are for the development of our natural gas and oil properties, acquisitions of additional natural gas and oil properties, repayments of debt and return of value to stockholders through dividends and equity repurchases. We believe our cash flow from operations, cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity under the 2025 Credit Facility, as discussed below, will provide sufficient liquidity during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2025, we had $4.1 billion of liquidity available, including $0.6 billion of cash on hand and $3.5 billion of aggregate unused borrowing capacity available under the 2025 Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2025 Credit Facility.\nFurther, we may from time to time seek to retire, refinance or amend some or all of our outstanding debt or debt agreements through exchanges, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, and the terms thereof, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved in such financing transactions may be material. See\nof the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion of our debt obligations, including principal and carrying amounts of our senior notes.\nOn October 28, 2025, we declared a base quarterly dividend payable of $0.575 per share, which will be paid on December 4, 2025 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 13, 2025.\nThe declaration and payment of any future dividend, whether fixed or variable, will remain at the full discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company’s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other relevant factors. The Company’s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders is restricted by (i) Oklahoma corporate law, (ii) its Certificate of Incorporation, (iii) the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement governing the 2025 Credit Facility and (iv) the terms and provisions of the indentures governing its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2029, 6.750% Senior Notes due 2029 and 5.70% Senior Notes due 2035 as well as the senior notes assumed from Southwestern, including the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2029, 5.375% Senior Notes due 2030 and 4.750% Senior Notes due 2032.\nDerivative and Hedging Activities\nOur results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas, oil and NGL. We enter into various derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of our exposure to commodity price declines, but these transactions may also limit our cash flows in periods of rising commodity prices. Our natural gas, oil and NGL derivative activities, when combined with our sales of natural gas, oil and NGL, allow us to better predict the total revenue we expect to receive. See\n\nITEM 2.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with management’s perspective on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The following discussion should be read together with the condensed consolidated financial statements included in\nof this report and the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our\nOn October 1, 2024, we completed the Southwestern Merger, creating a premier energy company that we believe is underpinned by a leading natural gas portfolio adjacent to the highest demand markets, premium inventory, a resilient financial foundation and an investment grade balance sheet. We believe that this new company is uniquely positioned to deliver affordable, lower-carbon energy to meet growing domestic and international demand while creating sustainable value for stakeholders. In conjunction with the closing of the Southwestern Merger, Chesapeake Energy Corporation changed its name to Expand Energy Corporation.\nExpand Energy is the largest independent natural gas producer in the U.S., based on net daily production, and is focused on responsibly developing an abundant supply of natural gas, oil and NGL to expand energy access for all. Our operations are located in Louisiana in the Haynesville and Bossier Shales (“Haynesville”), in Pennsylvania in the Marcellus Shale (“Northeast Appalachia”) and in West Virginia and Ohio in the Marcellus and Utica Shales (“Southwest Appalachia”).\nOur strategy is to create shareholder value through the responsible development of our significant resource plays while continuing to be a leading provider of natural gas to markets in need. We continue to focus on improving margins through operating efficiencies and financial discipline and improving our ESG performance. To accomplish these goals, we intend to allocate our human resources and capital expenditures to projects we believe offer the highest cash return on capital invested, to deploy leading drilling and completion technology throughout our portfolio, and to take advantage of acquisition and divestiture opportunities to strengthen our portfolio. We also intend to continue to dedicate capital to projects designed to reduce the environmental impact of our production activities.\nAdditionally, we aim to be conscientious in our efforts and how they will shape our approach to sustainability for the future and have established the following goals:\nNet zero (Scope 1 and 2) greenhouse gas emissions by 2035.\nMaintain 100% responsibly sourced gas (RSG) certification across our portfolio.\n\nOn October 1, 2024, we completed the Southwestern Merger and issued approximately 95.7 million shares of our common stock to Southwestern’s shareholders in connection with the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, each share of Southwestern common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.0867 of a share of the Company’s common stock. Based on the closing price of our common stock, the total value of such shares of our common stock issued to Southwestern’s shareholders was approximately $7.9 billion. See\nof the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion.\nInvestment Grade Rating\nOn October 1, 2024, we received an investment grade rating from S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”). S&P assigned an issuer-level rating of ‘BBB-’ on our unsecured debt and raised our issuer credit rating to ‘BBB-’, with a s"
