MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBaker Hughes Company (\"Baker Hughes,\" \"the Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We conduct business in more than 120 countries and employ approximately 57,000 employees. We operate through our two business segments: Oilfield Services & Equipment (\"OFSE\") and Industrial & Energy Technology (\"IET\"). We sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream and downstream segments, as well as broader industrial and new energy markets.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIn the third quarter of 2025, we saw continued slowing of activity across global oil markets, primarily due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, uncertainty around international trade policy, and operator concerns about the accelerated return of idled supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (\"OPEC+\").\nAs we look to the fourth quarter of 2025 and into 2026, we remain positive on the global natural gas outlook, while we anticipate ongoing volatility in oil markets. We expect that softer demand combined with increased OPEC+ production will contribute to rising oil inventories, which may lead to continued fluctuations in oil prices through 2026. Our forecast for global upstream spending in 2025 remains unchanged, with spending anticipated to be lower than in 2024 and restrained until the market absorbs potential oversupply. Over the longer term, we maintain our expectation for producers to shift spending towards the optimization of producing fields.\nWe remain optimistic on the global natural gas outlook, supported by a continued shift toward natural gas development and liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\"). We believe the positive fundamentals for global natural gas are less affected by near-term macro uncertainty. This optimism is underpinned by strong demand growth, favorable LNG contracting trends, and continuing positive momentum from other structural growth drivers, including rising power consumption and an ongoing commitment to lowering emissions throughout the energy ecosystem.\nWe will continue to monitor market conditions and assess potential risks, including uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment, trade policy and tariffs, the pace of OPEC+ restarted idled oil production, oil price volatility, changes in regulations and tax or other incentives for new energy solutions.\nFinancial Results and Key Company Initiatives\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the Company generated revenues of $7.0 billion, an increase of $0.1 billion, or 1%, compared to the third quarter of 2024. IET revenue increased $0.4 billion, or 15%, driven by strong growth in Gas Technology Equipment (\"GTE\") and Gas Technology Services (\"GTS\"). OFSE revenue decreased $0.3 billion, or 8%, led by a decline in international revenue. Net income was $0.6 billion, a decrease of $0.2 billion, or 20%, compared to the third quarter of 2024, with a decline in the market-to-market adjustment of certain equity securities, decreased volume, lower cost productivity, and transaction costs, partially offset by structural cost out initiatives, price, and favorable FX. We continue to progress in our efforts to improve efficiencies and modernize how the business operates, and those benefits have resulted in improved profitability.\nAs a part of our anticipated acquisition of Chart Industries, Inc. (\"Chart\"), Chart shareholders approved the acquisition of Chart by the Company (the \"Chart acquisition\") on October 6, 2025. We are currently working with various regulatory agencies to achieve the customary approvals and continue to expect the Chart acquisition to close in mid-2026. On portfolio management actions, we closed the acquisition of Continental Disc Corporation (\"CDC\") on August 7, 2025. The sale of Precision Sensors & Instrumentation to Crane Company and the creation of the Surface Pressure Control joint venture with Cactus, Inc. are progressing as expected, with both transactions anticipated to close in early 2026.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, we returned $227 million to shareholders through dividends.\nOur business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current macroeconomic uncertainty and continued volatile conditions in the industry. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today and are subject to changing conditions in the industry.\nOFSE outlook: We expect continued soft operator activity through the remainder of 2025, and global upstream spending will remain constrained until the potential excess oil supply is absorbed.\nIET outlook: We see continued strength in LNG and gas infrastructure, as well as increasing opportunities to leverage our versatile portfolio to enhance IET's position across industrial and distributed power markets, with a growing emphasis on data centers.\nWe also expect to see continued growth in new energy solutions specifically focused around reducing carbon emissions for the energy and broader industrial sectors. These include hydrogen; geothermal; carbon capture, utilization and storage; energy storage; clean power; and emissions abatement solutions.\nOverall, we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver integrated, high-impact solutions for our customers. Over time, we believe global energy demand will continue to rise, supported by durable, secular macroeconomic trends, with hydrocarbons continuing to play a fundamental role in meeting the world's energy needs. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, lower-emission, and cost-effective solutions that drive meaningful improvements in operational and financial performance for our customers.\nWe believe we have an important role to play in society as an industry leader and partner. We view the area of sustainability as a lever to transform the performance of our Company. In 2019, we made a commitment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from our operations by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. We continue to make progress on emissions reductions and reported in our 2024 Corporate Sustainability Report a 29.3% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions as compared to our 2019 base year.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity position as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nOur revenue is predominantly generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations, and their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOutside North America, customer spending is influenced by Brent oil prices. In North America, customer spending is influenced by WTI oil prices and natural gas prices are measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price.\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nBrent oil prices ($/Bbl)\nWTI oil prices ($/Bbl)\nNatural gas prices ($/mmBtu)\nEnergy Information Administration (\"EIA\") Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel\nEIA Cushing, OK West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") spot price\nEIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit\nRig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active or operating they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Therefore, rig counts may act as a leading indicator of market activity and reflect the relative strength of energy prices; however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nRig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated based on our published rig counts in our website at www.bakerhughes.com.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar.
