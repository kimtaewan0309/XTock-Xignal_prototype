The collateral of the Revolving Loan Facility was also modified.\nSee Note 7 – “Long-Term Debt” for more information.\nThe Company continues to experience healthy consumer demand across its portfolio of three brands for the balance of 2025 and into 2026, with strong demand for its Caribbean sailings. As a result, the Company remains well positioned within its optimal range for its forward 12-month booked position.\nStrategic Destination Investment\nWe announced a second phase of expansion plans for Great Stirrup Cay, the Company’s private island destination in the Bahamas, including a nearly six-acre Great Tides Waterpark expected to open in the summer of 2026. The addition of the nearly six-acre, 19-slide, Great Tides Waterpark which includes a 800-foot dynamic river and a 9,000-square-foot kids’ splash zone, along with other new amenities, will further enhance the guest experience at one of our most popular destinations. This is in addition to the previously announced two-ship pier, pool, family splash pad, welcome center and tram, which are expected to open by the end of 2025.\nStrategic Cost Optimization and Macroeconomic Trends\nOur strategic cost optimization efforts are driving a disciplined, company-wide focus on identifying efficiencies and optimizing costs across the organization.

Beyond the financial impact, this effort represents an evolution in our culture, embedding cost awareness, accountability, and continuous improvement into the way we operate.\nWe believe the increasing focus on climate change, including the Company’s targets for greenhouse gas (“GHG”) reductions, and evolving regulatory requirements will materially impact our future capital expenditures and results of operations.

We expect to incur significant expenses related to these regulatory requirements and commitments, which have and will include expenses related to GHG emissions reduction initiatives, including modifications to our ships, and have and will include the purchase of emissions allowances and alternative fuels, among other things. We have changed and may continue to be required to change certain operating procedures, for example slowing the speed of our ships, to meet regulatory requirements, which could adversely impact our operations. We are also evaluating the effects of global climate change-related requirements, which are still evolving, including our ability to mitigate certain future expenses through initiati"
