We allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory rates. We anticipate reporting an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% to 26.5% in the brokerage segment and 25.0% to 27.0% in the risk management segment for the foreseeable future. Reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied.\nIn the discussion that follows regarding our results of operations, we also provide the following ratios with respect to our operating results: pretax profit margin, compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio. Pretax profit margin represents pretax earnings divided by total revenues. The compensation expense ratio is compensation expense divided by total revenues. The operating expense ratio is operating expense divided by total revenues.\nOverview and Third Quarter 2025 Highlights\nWe are engaged in providing insurance brokerage, reinsurance brokerage, consulting services, and third-party property/casualty claims settlement and administration services to entities and individuals around the world. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, we generated approximately 67% of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically and 33% internationally, primarily in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. We have three reportable segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate. The brokerage and risk management segments contributed approximately 87% and 13%, respectively, to revenues during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025. The corporate segment did not generate any significant revenues in the nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2025. Our major sources of operating revenues are commissions, fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations. Interest income is earned on cash, cash equivalents and fiduciary cash and revenues are generated from premium financing.\nWe use the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers (which we refer to as CIAB) insurance pricing quarterly survey as an indicator of the insurance rate environment. The CIAB represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers, who write approximately 85% of the commercial property/casualty premiums in the U.S. The third quarter 2025 survey had not been published as of the filing date of this report. The second quarter 2025 survey indicated that commercial property/casualty rates increased by 3.7% on average and we expect a similar trend to be noted when the CIAB's third quarter 2025 survey report is issued, which would indicate overall continued price firming.\nWe believe increases in property/casualty rates will continue for the remainder of 2025 due to rising loss costs, increased frequency of natural catastrophe and weather related losses, prior year reserve volatility and social inflation. We estimate global insured natural catastrophe losses were approximately $105 billion during the first nine months of 2025\nThere has been no significant hurricane related losses in 2025; however, further global natural catastrophe loss activity during the remainder of the year may cause insurance and/or reinsurance carriers to increase property pricing upon renewal. Additionally, elevated loss trends and continued profitability concerns within casualty coverages, could lead to a more difficult rate and conditions environment in certain lines. Based on our experience, insurance and reinsurance carriers are providing adequate capacity in the market for nearly all lines of coverage and appear to be making rational pricing decisions. Accordingly, we are seeing more carrier competition across property, and continued caution within casualty lines.\nThe combination of economic growth and inflation is increasing insurable values, while a resilient labor market with low unemployment is likely contributing to increases in client insured exposures. Additionally, we have yet to see any meaningful changes in our customers’ business activity from the prospect of tariffs.\nWe expect that our history of strong new business generation, solid retentions and enhanced value‑added services for our carrier partners should result in further organic growth opportunities around the world. Overall, we believe that in a positive renewal premium change environment, both rate and exposure, our professionals can demonstrate their expertise and high‑quality, value-added capabilities by strengthening our clients’ insurance portfolios and delivering insurance and risk management solutions within our clients’ budgets.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (which we refer to as OBBBA) was enacted in the U.S. The OBBBA includes significant provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027. The application of the OBBBA is not currently expected to have a material impact on our financial statements for 2025.\nSummary of Financial Results - Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nSee the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures on page\n(In millions, except per share data)\nGAAP\nGAAP\nGAAP\nAdjusted EBITDAC margin\nDiluted net earnings per share\nRisk Management Segment\nRevenues before reimbursements\nNet earnings margin (before reimbursements)\nAdjusted EBITDAC margin (before reimbursements)\nDiluted net earnings per share\nDiluted net loss per share\nDiluted net earnings per share\nTotal Brokerage and Risk Management Segment\nDiluted net earnings per share\nSummary of Financial Results - Nine-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nSee the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures on page\n(In millions, except per share data)\nGAAP\nGAAP\nGAAP\nAdjusted EBITDAC margin\nDiluted net earnings per share\nRisk Management Segment\nRevenues before reimbursements\nNet earnings margin (before reimbursements)\nAdjusted EBITDAC margin (before reimbursements)\nDiluted net earnings per share\nDiluted net loss per share\nDiluted net earnings per share\nTotal Brokerage and Risk Management Segment\nDiluted net earnings per share\nThe following provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing revenues before reimbursements, net earnings, EBITDAC and diluted net earnings per share for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 with the same periods in 2024.
