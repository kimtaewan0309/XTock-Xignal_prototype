International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investment and taxation. Periodically, governments consider changes to tariffs, impose trade restrictions and accords. Currently, the United States Government has undertaken a substantial global trade rebalancing effort resulting in significantly higher tariffs on imports. Increased tariffs on certain sectors for Canada, China, and Mexico took effect in the first quarter of 2025. Additionally, reciprocal tariffs on certain countries were expected to take effect in April 2025, and were later postponed to July and August 2025, while trade negotiations by country were taking place. In the third quarter additional tariffs were imposed on imports from most countries including India, Brazil, and Japan. The United States has also imposed significantly higher tariffs on goods made in China. Additionally, sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum and their derivative products, as well as investigations were launched on other commodities since the second quarter of 2025. These measures have led to threatened or actual retaliatory tariffs and trade actions from several countries, including China and Canada. The \"de minimis\" exemption, which exempted goods made in China and Hong Kong of less than $800 in commercial value from tariffs and entry submission, was terminated on May 2, 2025, and expanded to all countries on August 29, 2025. The potential for further tariff changes and trade restrictions remains high, creating an unpredictable environment for international trade. Changes in import and export regulations may further impact the flow of trade and the global economy. We cannot predict how changes in tariffs and trade restrictions will affect our business. As governments impose import and export restrictions, shippers may adjust their sourcing patterns on a temporary or longer-term basis and potentially shift manufacturing to other countries over time. Additionally, the constant changes in trade regulations since the beginning of 2025 are adding complexity to the customs declarations process, making compliance with regulations increasingly challenging.\n\nDoing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises. In addition to being influenced by governmental policies and inter-governmental disputes concerning international trade, our business may also be negatively affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the United States and other countries, as well as economic turbulence, political unrest and security concerns in the nations and on the trade shipping routes in which we conduct business. The future impact that these events may have on international trade, oil prices and security costs is uncertain. We do not have employees, assets, or operations in Russia, Ukraine, Israel, the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. While limited, any shipment activity is conducted with independent agents in those countries in compliance with all applicable trade sanctions, laws and regulations. We have a branch and employees in Lebanon but no significant assets.\nOur ability to provide services to our customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities, including airlines, ocean carrier lines and ground transportation providers, as well as governmental agencies. We select and engage with best-in-class, compliance-focused, efficiently run, growth-oriented partners, based upon defined value elements and are intentional in our relationship and performance management activity. We consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory. However, changes in the financial stability; operating capabilities, and the capacity of asset-based carriers; capacity allotments available from carriers; governmental regulation or deregulation efforts; modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage; and/or changes in governmental restrictions, quota restrictions or trade accords could affect our business in unpredictable ways. When the market experiences seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption, the carriers often increase their pricing suddenly. This carrier behavior creates pricing volatility that could impact Expeditors' ability to maintain historical unitary profitability.\nThe global economic and trade environments remain highly uncertain; including inflation remaining higher than historical levels, volatility in oil prices, high interest rates and the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. In the first quarter of 2025, we saw high demand on exports out of Asia and continued to see high demand on exports out of South Asia in the second quarter 2025, resulting in high average sell and buy sell rates where demand exceeded carrier capacity. However, softening demand and additional available capacity for ocean freight resulted in declines in ocean sell and buy rates starting in the second quarter. Additional ocean and air transportation capacity will become available if demand softens due to uncertainty in economic and trade regulations and safe passage through the Red Sea resumes. These conditions could result in declines in average sell and buy rates. We also expect that pricing volatility will continue as carriers adapt to changes in demand, changing fuel prices, available capacity, security risks and react to governmental trade policies and other regulations. Additionally, we cannot predict the direct or indirect impact that further changes in purchasing behavior, such as the evolution of international direct e-commerce platforms, could have on our business. Some customers are relocating manufacturing to other countries to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs on imports, reduce their supply chain risks, address disruptions caused by pandemics and geopolitical issues. These changes could negatively affect our business.\n\nNorth Asia ocean freight and ocean services revenues decreased 43% and 13%, respectively, and expenses decreased 46% and 16% driven by lower volumes and average rates. Containers shipped out of North Asia region decreased 12% and 3%, respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 while they increased for other regions. This was mainly due to customers relocating sourcing out of China to other regions and softening of the retail sector.\nSouth Asia ocean freight and ocean services revenues and expenses decreased 23% and 28%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, while they increased 10% and 7%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The decreases in the third quarter are due to declining average sell and buy rates compared to a strong first half of 2025 when customers front loaded shipments in anticipation of higher tariffs.\nOrder management revenues and expenses decreased 7%, and 9%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, while they both increased 7% respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024 due to loss of volumes in the third quarter, mainly in the North Asia region as customers slowed down ordering or shifted sourcing given the uncertainty of U.S. tariff changes.\n\nCurrency and Other Risk Factors\nThe nature of our worldwide operations necessitates transacting in a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. That exposes us to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference. Some of the countries where we maintain offices and/or have agency relationships maintain strict currency control regulations that influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. Historically, derivative financial instruments have not been used to manage foreign currency risk. In lieu of the use of foreign currency derivatives we instead try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices and agents. In the future, we may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency risk. There are also regulatory or commercial limitations on our ability to move money freely, which could be impacted by inter-governmental disputes or new trade restrictions. We had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, net foreign currency transactional losses were approximately $3 million compared to net foreign currency losses of approximately $11 million in the same period in 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net foreign currency transactional losses were approximately $20 million compared to net foreign currency transactional gains of less than $1 million in the same period in 2024.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $201 million and $723 million as compared with $90 million and $474 million for the same periods in 2024. The increases of $111 million and $249 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, were primarily due changes in working capital. At September 30, 2025, working capital was $1,627 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $1,190 million. Other than our recorded lease liabilities, we had no long-term obligations or debt at September 30, 2025. Management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital a"
