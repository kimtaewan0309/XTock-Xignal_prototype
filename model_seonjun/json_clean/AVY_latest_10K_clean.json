We are Making Possible\nTM\nproducts and solutions that help advance the industries we serve, providing branding and information solutions that optimize labor and supply chain efficiency, reduce waste, advance sustainability, circularity and transparency, and better connect brands and consumers. We design and develop labeling and functional materials, radio-frequency identification (\"RFID\") inlays and tags, software applications that connect the physical and digital, and offerings that enhance branded packaging and carry or display information that improves the customer experience. We serve an array of industries worldwide, including home and personal care, apparel, general retail, e-commerce, logistics, food and grocery, pharmaceuticals and automotive.\nWe believe that our exposure to diverse and growing markets, the size and scale of operations, our innovation capabilities, productivity culture, and brand strength across our businesses are the primary advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position.\nOur reportable segments for fiscal year 2024 were Materials Group and Solutions Group. In 2024, our Materials Group and Solutions Group reportable segments comprised approximately 69% and 31%, respectively, of our total net sales.\nIn 2024, international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business, representing approximately 70% of our net sales. As of December 28, 2024, we operated over 200 manufacturing and distribution facilities and had locations in more than 50 countries.\nOur Materials Group is a leading global provider to the pressure-sensitive label and graphics industries. Our innovative products include label materials, graphics and reflective materials and functional bonding materials, like tapes. Our label materials enhance brands' shelf appeal, inform shoppers, advance circularity, increase transparency, help reduce waste and improve operational supply chain efficiency. Our graphics portfolio offers highly engineered products ranging from vehicle wraps to architectural films. Our tapes portfolio includes bonding and functional materials for applications in various industry sectors such as automotive, building and construction and electronics. We leverage the group's materials science capabilities and process engineering expertise to develop and manufacture Intelligent Labels at scale and drive their further adoption through our converter channel access.\nOur Materials Group manufactures and sells Fasson\n-, JAC\n-, and Avery Dennison\n-brand pressure-sensitive label materials and performance tapes products, Avery Dennison\n-brand graphics, and Avery Dennison\n-brand reflective products. Materials Group’s business tends not to be seasonal, except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products.\nPressure-sensitive materials consist primarily of papers, plastic films and metal foils, which are coated with internally-developed and purchased adhesives, and then laminated with specially-coated backing papers and films. They are then sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings in a wide range of face materials, sizes, thicknesses and adhesive properties.\nA pressure-sensitive, or self-adhesive, material is one that adheres to a surface by press-on contact. It generally consists of four layers: a face material, which may be paper, metal foil or plastic film; an adhesive, which may be permanent or removable; a release coating; and a backing material to protect the adhesive from premature contact with other surfaces that can also serve as a carrier for supporting and dispensing individual labels. When the products are ready for use, the release coating and protective backing are removed, exposing the adhesive so that the label or other face material may be pressed or rolled into place. Because they are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation, self-adhesive materials can provide cost savings compared to other materials that require heat- or moisture-activated adhesives, while also offering aesthetic and other advantages over alternative technologies.\nLabel materials are sold worldwide to label converters for labeling, decorating and specialty applications in the food, home and personal care, beer and beverage, durables, pharmaceutical, wine and spirits and logistics market segments. When used in package decoration applications, the visual appeal of self-adhesive materials can help increase sales of the products on which the materials are applied. Self-adhesive materials are also used to convey variable information through\nvarious digital triggers, including bar codes, QR codes and RFID inlays, for applications such as shipping labels and weight and price information for packaged meats and other foods. Self-adhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials, which can be made into labels of varying sizes and shapes.\nOur graphics and reflective products include a variety of films and other products that are sold to the architectural, commercial sign, digital printing and other related market segments. We also sell durable cast and reflective films to the construction, automotive and fleet transportation market segments and reflective films for traffic and safety applications. We provide sign shops, commercial printers and designers a broad range of pressure-sensitive materials that allow them to create impactful and informative brand and decorative graphics. We offer a wide array of pressure-sensitive vinyl and specialty materials designed for digital imaging, screen printing and sign cutting applications.\nOur performance tapes products include a variety of Fasson\n-brand and Avery Dennison\n-brand tapes and other pressure-sensitive adhesive-based materials and converted products, mechanical fasteners and performance polymers. Our pressure-sensitive adhesive-based materials are available in roll form and in a wide range of face materials, sizes, thicknesses and adhesive properties. These materials and converted products are used in non-mechanical fastening, bonding and sealing systems for various automotive, electronics, building and construction, general industrial, personal care, and medical applications. The mechanical fasteners are primarily precision-extruded and injection-molded plastic devices used in various automotive, general industrial and retail applications.\nOur larger competitors in label materials include UPM Raflatac, a subsidiary of UPM Corporation; Fedrigoni Self-Adhesives; Lintec Corporation; Flexcon Corporation, Inc.; and an array of smaller regional and local companies. For graphics and reflective products, our largest competitors are 3M Company (“3M”) and the Orafol Group. For performance tapes products, our competitors include 3M; Tesa-SE, a subsidiary of Beiersdorf AG; Nitto Denko Corporation; and numerous regional and specialty suppliers. For fastener products, there are a variety of competitors supplying extruded and injection molded fasteners and fastener attaching equipment. We believe that entry of competitors into the field of pressure-sensitive adhesives and materials is limited by technical knowledge and capital requirements. We believe that our technical expertise, size and scale of operations, broad line of quality products, reliable service, product and process innovation, distribution capabilities and brand strength are the primary advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position.\nOur Solutions Group is a leading provider of information and branding solutions that cover worldwide marketplace needs ranging from digital identification and data management to branding and embellishment, productivity, pricing and retail media.

We funded the 2023 Acquisitions and the acquisitions we completed in 2022 using cash and commercial paper borrowings. We also made certain venture investments in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nRefer to Note 2, “Business Acquisitions,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nFinancing Activities\nNet increase (decrease) in borrowings with maturities of three months or less\nAdditional long-term borrowings\nRepayments of long-term debt and finance leases\nNet (tax withholding) proceeds related to stock-based compensation\nNet cash used in financing activities\nBorrowings and Repayment of Debt\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, our commercial paper borrowings funded various activities, including repayments of long-term debt, acquisitions, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.\nIn November 2024, we issued €500 million of senior notes, due November 4, 2034, which bear an interest rate of 3.750% per year, payable annually in arrears. Our net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately €495 million ($539 million), which we intend to use to repay our €500 million of senior notes maturing in March 2025 and for general corporate purposes.\nIn August 2024, we repaid our $300 million of senior notes at maturity using cash flows from operations and commercial paper borrowings.\nIn March 2023, we issued $400 million of senior notes, due March 15, 2033, which bear an interest rate of 5.750% per year, payable semiannually in arrears. Our net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $394.9 million, which we used to repay indebtedness under our commercial paper programs and our $250 million of senior notes that matured on April 15, 2023.\nRefer to Note 4, \"Debt\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nWe paid dividends per share of $3.45, $3.18 and $2.93 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In April 2024, we increased our quarterly dividend rate to $0.88 per share, representing an increase of approximately 9% from our previous quarterly dividend rate of $0.81 per share. In April 2023, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.81 per share, representing an increase of approximately 8% from our previous dividend rate of $0.75 per share.\nFrom time to time, our Board authorizes the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock. Repurchased shares may be reissued under our long-term incentive plan or used for other corporate purposes. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million, 0.8 million and 2.2 million shares of our common stock, respectively.\nIn April 2022, our Board authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to $750 million, excluding any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such purchases and in addition to any amount outstanding under our previous Board authorization. Shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $346.9 million remained authorized for repurchase under this Board authorization as of December 28, 2024. Board authorizations remain in effect until shares in the amount authorized thereunder have been repurchased.\nNet (Tax Withholding) Proceeds Related to Stock-Based Compensation\nApproximately 0.1 million stock options were exercised in 2024, resulting in proceeds of approximately $10 million. Refer to Note 12, “Long-Term Incentive Compensation,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAnalysis of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, decreased by approximately $39 million to $1.59 billion at year-end 2024, which primarily reflected depreciation expense and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nGoodwill decreased by approximately $37 million to $1.98 billion at year-end 2024, which primarily reflected the impact of foreign currency translation.\nOther intangibles resulting from business acquisitions, net, decreased by approximately $94 million to $755.3 million at year-end 2024, primarily reflecting current year amortization expense.\nRefer to Note 3, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles Resulting from Business Acquisitions,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOther assets increased by approximately $88 million to $897.3 million at year-end 2024, primarily reflecting higher capitalized implementation costs associated with our cloud computing arrangements and higher operating lease assets.\nLong-term Retirement Benefits and Other Liabilities\nOther long-term retirement benefits and other liabilities decreased by approximately $66 million to $434.6 million at year-end 2024, primarily reflecting the settlement payment for the Adasa legal matter.\nShareholders’ Equity Accounts\nThe balance of our shareholders’ equity increased by approximately $184 million to $2.31 billion at year-end 2024. Refer to Note 11, “Supplemental Equity and Comprehensive Income Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Translation\nIn 2024, international operations generated approximately 70% of our net sales. Our future results are subject to changes in geopolitical, social and economic conditions in the regions in which we operate and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily related to sales in China and Brazil, partially offset by the favorable impact of euro-denominated sales.\nEffect of Foreign Currency Transactions\nThe impact on net income from foreign currency transactions is largely mitigated because the costs of our products are generally denominated in the same currencies in which they are sold. In addition, to reduce our income and cash flow exposure to transactions in foreign currencies, we enter into foreign currency exchange forward, option and swap contracts where available and appropriate. Refer to Note 5, “Financial Instruments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nDuring 2024 and 2023, the Argentine peso devalued significantly compared to the U.S. dollar, resulting in remeasurement losses of approximately $16 million and $30 million, respectively, which was included in \"Other expense (income), net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The 2024 losses included Blue Chip Swap transactions that resulted in losses of approximately $10 million. Refer to Note 16, “Supplemental Financial Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAnalysis of Selected Financial Ratios\nWe utilize the financial ratios discussed below to assess our financial condition and operating performance. We believe this information assists our investors in understanding the factors impacting our cash flow other than net income and capital expenditures.\nOperational Working Capital Ratio\nOperational working capital, as a percentage of annualized current-quarter net sales, is reconciled to working capital below. Our objective is to minimize our investment in operational working capital, as a percentage of annualized current-quarter net sales, to maximize our cash flow and return on investment. Operational working capital, as a percentage of annualized current-quarter net sales, in 2024 was comparable with 2023. Further information regarding the components of operational working capital is provided below.\n(In millions, except percentages)\n(A)\nCash and cash equivalents\nOther current assets\nShort-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt and finance leases\nCurrent income taxes payable and other current accrued liabilities\n(B)\nOperational working capital\n(C)\nFourth-quarter net sales, annualized\nOperational working capital, as a percentage of annualized current-quarter net sales (B) ÷ (C)\nAccounts Receivable Ratio\nThe average number of days sales outstanding was 61 days in both 2024 and 2023, calculated using the accounts receivable balance at year-end divided by the average daily sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAverage inventory turnover was 6.4 in 2024 compared to 6.6 in 2023, calculated using the annualized fourth-quarter cost of products sold in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and divided by the inventory balance at the respective year-end. The decrease in average inventory turnover primarily reflected higher inventory balances, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.\nAccounts Payable Ratio\nThe average number of days payable outstanding was 77 days in both 2024 and 2023, calculated using the accounts payable balance at year-end divided by the annualized fourth-quarter cost of products sold in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCapital resources include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents and debt financing, including access to commercial paper borrowings supported by our revolving credit facility (the \"Revolver\"). We use these resources to fund our operational needs.\nAt year-end 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $329.1 million held in accounts at third-party financial institutions in numerous locations throughout the world. At year-end 2024, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries, primarily in the Asia Pacific region.\nTo meet our U.S. cash requirements, we have several cost-effective liquidity options available. These options include borrowing funds at reasonable rates, including borrowings from our foreign subsidiaries, and repatriating foreign earnings and profits. However, if we were to repatriate foreign earnings and profits, a portion would be subject to cash payments of withholding taxes imposed by foreign tax authorities. Additional U.S. taxes may also result from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to these earnings and profits.\nIn June 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") related to our Revolver to borrow up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion through its maturity date of June 26, 2029. The Revolver refinanced the prior revolving credit facility under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 13, 2020, as amended. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the commitments under the Revolver may be increased by up to $600 million, subject to lender approvals and customary requirements. Under certain circumstances, we may request that the commitments under the Revolver be extended for one-year periods in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. We use the Revolver as a back-up facility for our commercial paper program and for other corporate purposes.\nThe Revolver contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio (calculated as a ratio of consolidated debt minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50 million to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the agreement) of not more than 3.50 to 1.00; provided that, in the event of an acquisition by us that exceeds $250 million, the maximum leverage ratio increases to 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition occurs and the three fiscal quarters immediately following that fiscal quarter. As of December 28, 2024, our ratio was substantially below the maximum ratio allowed by the Revolver. As of December 30, 2023, our ratio was substantially below the maximum rate allowed by our previous revolving credit facility.\nIn addition to the Revolver, we have short-term lines of credit available in various countries of approximately $261 million in the aggregate at December 28, 2024. These lines may be cancelled at any time by us or the issuing banks. Borrowings under our short-term lines of credit were not material as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.\nWe are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates, and to possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.\nWe currently anticipate using the net proceeds from the €500 million of senior notes we issued in the fourth quarter of 2024, cash flows from operations and commercial paper borrowings to repay €500 million of senior notes, $25 million of medium-term notes and $5 million of medium-term notes maturing in the first, second and third quarters of 2025, respectively.\nThe carrying value of our total debt decreased by approximately $92 million to $3.15 billion at year-end 2024 from year-end 2023, primarily due to the repayment of our $300 million of senior notes that matured in August 2024, a net decrease in commercial paper borrowings and the revaluation of our euro-denominated senior notes, partially offset by our issuance of €500 million of senior notes in November 2024.\nCredit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise short- and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned to our company also impact the interest rates we pay and our access to commercial paper, c",
