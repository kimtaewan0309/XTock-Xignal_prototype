  "item1_clean": "Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Sweden, Iceland, and New Zealand. Costco operated 914, 890, and 861 warehouses worldwide at August 31, 2025, September 1, 2024, and September 3, 2023. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.”\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2025 and 2024 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 31, 2025, and September 1, 2024. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023.\nWe operate membership warehouses and e-commerce sites based on the concept that offering low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.\nWe buy most of our merchandise directly from suppliers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from suppliers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering\ncosts associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. Our e-commerce operations ship merchandise through our depots and logistics operations, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers.\nOur average warehouse space is approximately 147,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\nOur operating hours are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse club operation, we believe labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. In the U.S., we recently added exclusive shopping hours for our Executive members and our gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card).\nOur strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average from 9,000 to 10,000 SKUs online, some of which are available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.\nTo promote member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items and major appliances.\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\nCore Merchandise Categories:\n(including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, liquor, and tobacco)\n(including major appliances, small electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, lawn and garden, sporting goods, tires, toys and seasonal, automotive, stamps, tickets, apparel, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry)\n(including meat, produce, deli, and bakery)\n(includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation)\n(includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other)\nWarehouse ancillary operate primarily within, next to or near our warehouses, encouraging more frequent shopping. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country. We operated 747 gas stations at the end of 2025. Our gasoline business represented approximately 10% of total net sales in 2025.\nOur other businesses sell products and services that largely complement our warehouse operations. Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 7% of total net sales in 2025. Digitally-enabled sales,\nwhich represents sales delivered to members that are initiated through a digital device, whether fulfilled through a warehouse or distribution center, as well as Costco Travel, represented approximately 10% of total net sales in 2025. Our business centers carry items tailored for food services, convenience stores and offices and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco Travel offers vacation packages, car rentals, cruises and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered to varying degrees in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the U.K.).\nWe have direct relationships with many producers of brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. When sources of supply become unavailable, we seek alternative sources or items. For future product supply need, we pursue diversification in our supply-chain and seek to expand in-country production. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant.\nCertain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in\nto the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license or comparable document. Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $65 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $65. Executive memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,250 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses. The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.6% of worldwide net sales in 2025.\nMembership at the end of 2025, 2024, and 2023 was made up of the following (in thousands):\nBusiness, including affiliates\nExecutive members represented 38,700, 35,400, and 32,300 of total paid members in 2025, 2024, and 2023.\nThese membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have expired and not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. These expired memberships make up a small percentage of these membership counts, and many of them are subsequently renewed.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.3% in the U.S. and Canada and 89.8% worldwide at the end of 2025. That rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Memberships that have an expiration date in the six months prior to the end of our reporting period are excluded from this calculation, regardless of whether or not they have been renewed. Although most members renew prior to expiration, the vast majority of those who renew late do so within six months of expiration. The timing of\nrenewal after expiration is impacted by a variety of factors, such as warehouse openings and promotional activity.\n“Take Care of Our Employees,” is a key component of our code of ethics and is fundamental to our commitment to “Take Care of Our Members.” Compensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is carefully monitored.\nAt the end of 2025, we employed 341,000 employees worldwide. Approximately 95% are employed in our membership warehouses and distribution channels. Around 5% are represented by unions. We also utilize seasonal employees.\nThe total number of employees by segment was:\nGrowth and Engagement\nWe believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry, owing largely to the commitment and efficiency of our employees. We seek to provide them not merely with employment but careers. Many attributes of our business contribute to the objective. The more significant include: competitive compensation and benefits; a commitment to employee development and promoting from within; and a target ratio of at least 50% of our base being full-time employees. These attributes contribute to what we consider, especially for the industry, a high retention rate. In 2025, in the U.S. and Canada that rate was approximately 94% for employees who have been with us for at least one year.\nThe commitment to “Take Care of Our Employees” includes promoting an inclusive and respectful workplace. We strive for an environment where all employees feel that they belong, are accepted, included, respected and supported. We demonstrate leadership commitment to inclusion through consistent communication, employee development and education, support of diversity and inclusion initiatives within the organization, community involvement, and supplier inclusion. Listening to our employees is one of the ways Costco takes care of its workforce. In 2025, we hosted the Costco Connects meetings, its second annual Costco Connects campaign. These open listening sessions are an invitation for employees to talk about what is on their minds and what is impacting them both personally and professionally. This allows Costco leaders to engage with their employees on a deeper level and for employees to build connections with each other. This year we had approximately 200,000 employees participate globally. Costco continues its efforts to develop future leaders, including through our supervisor in training (SIT) programs in the U.S. and Canada. In 2025, approximately 7,500 hourly employe",
  "item7_clean": "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(amounts in millions, except per share, share, percentages and warehouse count data)\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other). E-commerce and business center sales are allocated to the appropriate merchandise categories in the Net Sales discussion. The 2% reward associated with Executive membership reduces net sales and is allocated to the category in which the reward is generated (core merchandise categories, warehouse ancillary, and other businesses). Comparable sales is defined as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce sites operating for more than one year. The measure is intended as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations) and inflation or deflation in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our net sales and gross margin are influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, sourcing in the countries and regions where items are sold, as well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of\nnet sales (gross margin percentage) in the near term. Our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, has a lower gross-margin percentage than our warehouse operations.\nGovernment actions in various countries relating to tariffs affect the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs are more likely to adversely impact rather than improve our results.\nWe believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses; it generally has a lower gross margin percentage and lower SG&A expense relative to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect.\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows and available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. Negative aspects of such growth include lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in many of our foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.\nThe membership format is integral to our business and profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive memberships, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our paid-membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our worldwide renewal rate is adversely impacted by membership growth in newer international markets and a higher penetration of memberships sold online, including through digital membership promotions, which renew at a slightly lower rate on average.\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.\nOur operating models are generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see\nto the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon. Results expressed excluding the impacts of foreign-exchange and gasoline prices are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net\nsales presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2025 and 2024 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 31, 2025, and September 1, 2024. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding.\nHighlights for 2025 include:\nWe opened 27 new warehouses, including three relocations, for a total of 24 net new warehouses: 15 in the U.S., two in our Canadian segment, and seven in our Other International segment, compared to 30 new warehouses, including one relocation, in 2024;\nNet sales increased 8% to $269,912, driven by an increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses;\nMembership fee revenue increased 10% to $5,323, driven by new member sign-ups and membership fee increases;\nGross margin percentage increased 20 basis points; 11 basis points excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales;\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 11 basis points; three basis points excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation;\nThe effective tax rate in 2025 was 25.1%, compared to 24.4% in 2024;\nNet income increased 10% to $8,099, or $18.21 per diluted share compared to $7,367, or $16.56 per diluted share in 2024. Foreign-exchange rates had a negative impact on net income of $97, $0.22 per diluted share; and\nIn April, the Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the quarterly cash dividend.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nChanges in net sales:\nU.S.\nChanges in comparable sales\nU.S.\nChanges in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-currency and gasoline prices\nU.S.\nComparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet sales increased $20,287 or 8% during 2025. The improvement was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable sales of $14,788 or 6%. Comparable sales were positively impacted by increases of 5% in shopping frequency and approximately 1% in average ticket. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by sales at the 24 net new warehouses opened since the end of 2024.\nSales increased $19,086 or 10% in core merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales in warehouse ancillary and other businesses increased $1,201, or 2%.\nLower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $2,329, or 93 basis points, with an 8% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 2%, positively impacting net sales by $440, or 18 basis points.\nChanges in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,943, or 78 basis points, attributable to our Other International and Canadian operations.\nMembership fee revenue increased 10% in 2025, driven by new member sign-ups and membership fee increases. At the end of 2025, our member renewal rates were 92.3% in the U.S. and Canada and 89.8% worldwide. Renewal rates were negatively impacted by a higher number of memberships sold online,\nincluding through digital promotions, entering the renewal rate calculation. These members renew at a slightly lower rate on average.\nAs previously reported, we increased our annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada, effective September 1, 2024. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. The fee income increase accounted for approximately 40% of membership income growth during 2025.\nLess merchandise costs\nGross margin percentage\nGross margin percentage increased 20 basis points. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 11.03%, an increase of 11 basis points. This increase was positively impacted by 19 basis points in our core merchandise categories, primarily due to fresh foods and our co-branded credit card program. Gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by seven basis points due to a LIFO charge in 2025 for higher merchandise costs and one basis point in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $224, attributable to our Other International and Canadian operations.\nThe gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 16 basis points. The increase was primarily due to fresh foods and foods and sundries, partially offset by non-foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margin from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.\nGross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage),\nincreased in our U.S. segment, which performed similarly to the consolidated results above. Our Canadian and Other International segments gross margin increased, primarily due to increases in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 11 basis points. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation was 9.17%, an increase of three basis points. The comparison to last year was negatively impacted by three basis points due to warehouse operations and other businesses. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased SG&A expenses by approximately $127, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nInterest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and financing leases. The decrease was primarily due to repayment of the 2.750% Senior Notes in May 2024. For more information on our debt arrangements, refer to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nInterest Income and Other, Net\nForeign-currency transaction gains, net\nInterest income and other, net\nThe decrease in interest income in 2025 was due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher cash balances. Foreign-currency transaction gains, net, include revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities, and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts. See Derivatives and Foreign-Currency sections in\nto the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nThe effective tax rate for 2025 was favorably impacted by discrete tax benefits of $100 related to stock compensation.\nThe effective tax rate for 2024 was favorably impacted by discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special cash dividend payable through our 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and $45 related to stock compensation.\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) introduced a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15% (referred to as Pillar 2) which was effective f",
