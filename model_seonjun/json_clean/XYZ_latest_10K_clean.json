  "item1_clean": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nAt Block, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, \"Block\" or \"we\"), we are building an ecosystem dedicated to economic empowerment and unlocking access to the financial system for people around the world. We do this by building the most relevant products and tools for the communities we serve including sellers, consumers, artists, fans and developers. Our brands work together cohesively, often positively reinforcing one another and creating resonant relationships with people who use our products to meet multiple needs across the different aspects of their lives. As we scale, we are focused on investing in building deeper connections between our ecosystems and increasing the resilience of our company.\nOn December 1, 2021, we changed our corporate name from Square, Inc. to Block, Inc. Block is the name for the company as a corporate entity. Since our start in 2009 with the Square business, we have added Cash App, and relatively nascent businesses with TIDAL and two bitcoin businesses, Bitkey and Proto.\nOur two reportable segments are Square, formerly referred to as Seller, and Cash App, which reflects our two primary ecosystems and the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") reviews and assesses performance.\nWe started Block with the Square ecosystem in February 2009 to enable businesses (\"sellers\") to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to many businesses. As our company grew, we recognized that sellers need a variety of solutions to thrive and saw how we could apply our strength in technology and innovation to help sellers. We have since expanded Square into a cohesive commerce ecosystem that provides more than 30 distinct products and services to help our sellers start, run, and grow their businesses. We combine software, hardware, and financial services to create products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant. These attributes differentiate Square in a fragmented industry that traditionally forced sellers to stitch together products and services from multiple vendors, and often rely on inefficient non-digital processes and tools. Our ability to add new sellers efficiently, help them grow their business, and cross-sell our products and services has historically contributed to our long-term growth.\nCash App provides an ecosystem of financial products and services to help consumers manage their money. Cash App’s goal is to redefine the world’s relationship with money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible. While Cash App started with the single ability to send and receive money, it now provides an ecosystem of financial services focused on helping consumers make their money go further by enabling customers to store, send, receive, spend, invest, buy now, pay later (\"BNPL\"), borrow or save their money with Cash App. Similar to our Square ecosystem, we believe the aggregation of these products into one app differentiates Cash App from competitors and provides greater utility for customers, allowing Cash App to build retentive relationships with its customers. Over time, with its bank partners, Cash App is aiming to become one of the top providers of banking services to households in the United States that earn up to $150,000 per year.\nTIDAL expands our purpose of economic empowerment to artists. TIDAL is a global platform for musicians and their fans that uses unique content, experiences, and features to bring fans closer to artists and to provide artists with tools to succeed as entrepreneurs. TIDAL offers an extensive catalog of more than 162 million songs and 927,000 high-quality videos. TIDAL has a global presence with listeners in more than 60 countries and relationships with more than 300 labels and distributors.\nOur bitcoin ecosystem includes our bitcoin hardware projects, which include Bitkey, a self-custody bitcoin wallet, Proto, a bitcoin mining system, as well as Spiral, an independent team focused on contributing to bitcoin open source work. We believe our bitcoin ecosystem can help address inefficiencies in the current financial system, especially with respect to identity and trust. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced our decision to wind down TBD, which was an open developer platform for decentralized finance.\nSquare sellers represent a diverse range of industries (including services, food-related, and retail businesses) and sizes, ranging from sole proprietors to multinational businesses. Square sellers span geographies, including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, and Spain. We believe the diversity of our sellers underscores the accessibility and flexibility of our offerings. We have also increasingly served mid-market sellers, which we define as sellers that generate more than $500,000 in annualized Square Gross Payment Volume (“Square GPV”), due to our ability to offer more flexible and complex solutions than traditional alternatives, as well as a growing product suite. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, none of our customers accounted for greater than 5% of Square GPV. We define Square GPV as the total dollar amount of all card and bank payments processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, more than 4 million sellers used the Square ecosystem to make 5.2 billion individual sales transactions totaling $228 billion of Square GPV. These sales transactions originated from more than 800 million payment cards, across more than 300 million buyer profiles.\nThe charts below show the percentage mix of our Square GPV by seller industry and seller size for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nOur Cash App Customers\nAs of December 2024, Cash App had 57 million monthly transacting actives across the United States. In 2024, Cash App was the number one finance app on Google Play and number two finance app on iOS based on downloads in the United States. Cash App has a diverse mix of customers and, in the United States, had monthly transacting actives in each of the 50 states and nearly every county as of December 2024.\nIn 2024, Cash App transacting actives brought $283 billion in inflows into Cash App. Customers can fund their Cash App accounts with inflows in a variety of ways, including by receiving money from another Cash App customer through the app’s core peer-to-peer transfer service, transferring money from a bank account, depositing mobile checks, adding physical cash at participating retailers, and receiving a recurring paycheck by direct deposit. In the fourth quarter of 2024, our Cash App monthly transacting actives brought in an average of $1,255 of inflows during the quarter. A transacting active is a Cash App account that has at least one financial transaction using any product or service within Cash App during the specified period. Examples of transactions include sending or receiving a peer-to-peer payment, transferring money into or out of Cash App, making a purchase using Cash App Card, earning a dividend on a stock investment, and paying back a loan, among others. Certain of these accounts may share an alias identifier with one or more other transacting active accounts. This could represent, among other things, one customer with multiple accounts or multiple customers sharing one alias identifier (for example, families).\nOur Products and Services\nOur Square ecosystem consists of more than 30 distinct software, hardware, and financial services products. Our products are designed to be self-serve and intuitive to make initial setup and new employee training fast and easy, although we also offer full-service setup and support. Our products are also flexible enough to serve the needs of both small, single location and large, complex multi-location sellers. Our products are integrated to create a seamless experience and enable a holistic view of sales, customers, employees, and finances. We believe the breadth and depth of our products and services provide us unique advantages in best serving the needs of our sellers through a holistic view of their businesses. We supplement these first party capabilities with our open developer platform that enables integrations with third-party applications. We monetize these products through a combination of transaction, subscription, and service fees.\nStrategic Priorities\nOur focus for Square is on four priorities: maintaining our secure, and flexible multi-product platform, providing a “local” experience to sellers of all sizes, growing with artificial intelligence (“AI”), and further developing our banking offering.\nIt is critical that we have a strong foundation to build upon to serve external customers through our developer platform and partner ecosystem, and our internal team's first party products. This includes increasing reliability of our platform and also introducing products and features that are most important to our customers.\nOur go-to-market strategy is focused on verticals with a local approach, specifically restaurants and services-based businesses. Growing upmarket has shown us that even larger sellers want to feel authentic to their buyers. We can enable this type of robust offering through our technology and by improving the onboarding process through sales and account management.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI):\nWe are focused on enabling growth by leveraging AI to increase productivity and outcomes for our sales and marketing, customer service, and engineering efforts, in addition to building features that help sellers grow their businesses.\nOur robust banking offering primarily helps our sellers manage cash flow and grow their business through our lending capabilities. We will continue to drive trust with our sellers, and build products and features that help with sellers accessing funds securely and timely.\nSquare's commerce products help sellers make sales and track orders, inventory, and fulfillment across in-person and online channels, as well as first-party and third-party channels. Most of our Square commerce products have a free tier (without a subscription fee), which we monetize only through transaction fees on card payments. Some commerce products also have premium tiers with additional functionality, which we monetize through subscription fees in addition to transaction fees on payments.\nSquare Point of Sale\nis our primary commerce application for sellers, and provides an easy-to-use, customizable point-of-sale solution that adapts across business types and stages. Over the past year, we have modernized and simplified our Point of Sale applications, combining our vertical software solutions into one Square Point of Sale app, which now includes:\nA vertical solution tailored for both quick-service and full-service restaurants. It includes table, order, and course management; a kitchen display system; and revenue and cost reporting.\nA vertical solution tailored for appointment-based businesses that need a point-of-sale application with integrated booking capabilities. Our features include a free online booking site so buyers can easily schedule appointments and select their preferred time, service, and staff member. It is also integrated with Square Assistant, an AI-enabled automated messaging tool designed to respond to buyers efficiently and professionally, saving sellers' time and helping prevent missed appointments.\nA vertical solution tailored for sellers in the retail industry. It includes advanced inventory management, cost of goods sold reporting, purchase orders, vendor management, and barcode scanning.\nA customizable digital invoicing solution with integrated and secure online payment acceptance. This eliminates the need to print and mail statements to customers and wait for checks to arrive. Sellers use Square Invoices for upcoming, recurring, or previously delivered goods and services, such as catering orders, contracto",
  "item7_clean": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe launched the Square ecosystem in February 2009 to enable businesses (\"sellers\") to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to many businesses. We have expanded to provide sellers additional products and services and to give them access to a cohesive ecosystem of tools to help them manage and grow their businesses. Similarly, with Cash App, we have built an ecosystem of financial products and services to help individuals manage their money. In January 2022, we completed the acquisition of Afterpay, a buy now, pay later (\"BNPL\") platform that facilitates commerce between retail merchants and consumers by allowing retail merchant clients to offer their customers the ability to buy goods and services on a BNPL basis. In addition, our nascent businesses include TIDAL and two bitcoin businesses, Bitkey and Proto.\nWe delivered strong growth across our primary ecosystems in 2024, with gross profit of $8.9 billion, up 18% year over year. Cash App generated gross profit of $5.2 billion in 2024, up 21% year over year. Performance was driven by growth in inflows per active as we execute on our Bank Our Base strategy, which prioritizes engaging customers with more products across our ecosystem and increasing paycheck deposit actives. Square generated gross profit of $3.6 billion in 2024, up 15% year over year, as we continued to increase product velocity and optimize our go-to-market strategies.\nIn 2024, operating income was $892.3 million and Adjusted Operating Income was $1.6 billion, compared to an operating loss of $278.8 million and Adjusted Operating Income of $351.4 million in 2023. For the same period, net income attributable to common stockholders was $2.9 billion compared to $9.8 million, and Adjusted EBITDA was $3.0 billion, an increase of 69% year over year. Net income for 2024 and 2023 included a gain of $420.9 million and $207.1 million, respectively, from the remeasurement of our bitcoin investment. Additionally, as a result of our improved profitability in the United States, we released our valuation allowance associated with certain federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as recognized deferred tax assets as part of internal legal entity restructuring efforts, which resulted in one-time benefits to net income for 2024 of $1.9 billion. These one-time tax benefits had a corresponding impact of $3.10 and $3.00 per share on our basic and diluted net income per share, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nKey Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nsection below for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") equivalents.\nStarting in 2023, we sharpened our focus on our organizational structure and expenditures with a view to identifying areas where we can be more cost efficient as we focus on disciplined growth and pursuing cost efficiencies. In 2023, we also announced we would implement an absolute cap of 12,000 on the number of employees we have at our company, which we have achieved in 2024, and we plan to continue to operate below this cap through a combination of performance management, centralization of teams and functions to reduce duplication, and prioritization of our scope. In 2024, we continued to make progress on cost efficiency goals and we expect to continue these efforts, including implementing greater expense discipline and reassessing certain contractual vendor arrangements. We may continue to incur expenses, including restructuring costs, in the short term to implement these initiatives. We continue to realize benefits related to our focus on disciplined growth and cost efficiencies and we expect to continue to benefit from these actions in future periods.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we issued $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2032 (\"2032 Senior Notes\"). We ended 2024 with $10.7 billion in available liquidity, with $9.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments in marketable debt securities, as well as an undrawn amount of $775.0 million available under our revolving credit facility. This represents an increase of $3.0 billion from the end of 2023.\nOn October 26, 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the Company’s Class A common stock. On July 25, 2024, our board of directors authorized an increase to this share repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional $3 billion of our Class A common stock, for a total overall authorization of $4 billion. The goal of the program is to return capital to shareholders. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other factors. As of December 31, 2024, we have repurchased $1.3 billion of our Class A common stock under the program, of which $1.2 billion was purchased in 2024.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nTransaction-based Revenue\nWe charge our sellers a transaction fee that is generally calculated based on a percentage of the total transaction amount processed. We also selectively offer custom pricing for certain larger sellers. Transaction-based revenue also includes amounts we charge our Cash App customers for peer-to-peer transactions to business accounts and payments sent from a credit card.\nSubscription and Services-based Revenue\nSubscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of revenue we generate from Cash App, Square Loans (formerly known as Square Capital), our BNPL platform, TIDAL, and various other software as a service (“SaaS”) products that we offer through Square. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from Cash App Instant Deposit, Cash App Card, bitcoin withdrawal fees, and other Cash App financial services offerings. Our other SaaS products include subscription fees on our vertical software solutions (including Square for Restaurants, Square Appointments, and Square for Retail), Customer Engagement products (including Square Loyalty, Square Marketing, Square Gift Cards), staff management products (including Square Team Management and Square Payroll), website hosting and domain name registration services, and other products.\nInstant Deposit is a functionality within the Cash App and our managed payment solutions that enables customers, including individuals and sellers, to instantly deposit funds into their bank accounts.\nCash App Card offers Cash App customers the ability to use their stored funds via a Visa prepaid card that is linked to the balance the customer stores in Cash App. We charge the customer a per transaction fee when they instantly deposit funds to their bank account or withdraw funds from an ATM. We also earn interchange fees when a Cash App Card is used to make a purchase. These transaction and interchange fees are treated as revenue when charged.\nSquare Loans originates loans to sellers that are generally repaid through withholding a percentage of the collections of the seller's receivables processed by us or a specified monthly amount. In April 2021, we began originating loans in the U.S. through our wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Square Financial Services. We also originate loans to the customers of certain sellers, which are generally repaid via ACH. For some of the loans, it is our intention to sell the rights, title, and interest to third-party investors for an upfront fee. We are retained by the third-party investors to service the loans and earn a servicing fee for facilitating the repayment of these loans through our payments solutions. Certain loans, for which we have the intention and ability to hold through maturity, are not immediately sold to third-party investors, in which case, interest and fees earned are recognized as revenue using the effective interest method.\nCash App Borrow, the first credit product for Cash App customers, allows customers to access short-term loans for a small fee. The loans are repaid at the end of the loan term and customers may elect to prepay all or a part of the outstanding balance. If the outstanding balance is not paid when due, late fees in the form of interest may be charged. The short-term loans are facilitated through a partnership with an industrial bank. The loans are originated by the bank partner, from whom the Company purchases the loans obtaining all rights, title, and interest. Net amounts paid to the bank are recorded as the cost of the loans purchased, and amounts collected in excess of the carrying value are recognized as revenue over the life of the loans.\nRevenue from our BNPL platform includes fees generated from consumer receivables, late fees, and certain affiliate and advertising fees. Through the use of our BNPL platform, consumers can pay for their purchases over time by splitting their purchase price generally into three or four installments, typically due in two-week increments, without paying fees (if payments are made on time). For the majority of our BNPL products, we do not charge consumers interest or fees, other than late fees, which may be charged in certain regions as an incentive to encourage consumers to pay their outstanding balances as and when they fall due. We also offer the ability for consumers to pay for larger transaction sizes over a six- or twelve-month period using a monthly payment option, which includes no late fees and no compounding interest with a cap on total interest owed. For some of the loans, it is our intention to sell the rights, title, and interest to a third-party investor for an upfront fee. We are retained by the third-party investor to service the loans and earn a servicing fee for facilitating the repayment of these loans through our payments solutions.\nTIDAL primarily generates revenue from subscriptions to customers, and such subscriptions allow access to the song library, video library, and improved sound quality. Customers can subscribe to services directly from the TIDAL website or through the Apple store. For both subscription channels, we charge customers a monthly fee for those subscription services.\nHardware revenue includes revenue from sales of magstripe readers, contactless and chip readers, Square Stand, Square Register, Square Terminal, and third-party peripherals. Third-party peripherals include cash drawers, receipt printers, scales, and barcode scanners, all of which can be integrated with Square Stand, Square Register, or Square Terminal to provide a comprehensive point-of-sale solution.\nOur Cash App customers have the ability to purchase bitcoin, a cryptocurrency. We recognize revenue when customers purchase bitcoin and it is transferred to the customer's account. We purchase bitcoin from private broker dealers or from Cash App customers and apply a small margin before selling it to our customers. The sale amounts received from our customers are recorded as revenue on a gross basis and the associated bitcoin cost as cost of revenues, as we are the principal in the bitcoin sale transaction. Bitcoin revenue may fluctuate as a result of changes in customer demand or the market price of bitcoin.\nTransaction-based Costs\nTransaction-based costs consist primarily of interchange and assessment fees, processing fees, and bank settlement fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial institutions.\nSubscription and Services-based Costs\nSubscription and services-based costs consist primarily of processing and partnership fees related to Cash App including Instant Deposit and Cash App Card, and our BNPL platform, as well as costs associated with TIDAL.\nHardware costs consist primarily of product costs associated with magstripe readers, contactless and chip readers, Square Stand, Square Register, Square Terminal, and third-party peripherals. Product costs include manufacturing-related overhead and personnel-related costs, certain royalties, packaging, and fulfillment costs. Hardware is sold primarily as a means to grow our transaction-based revenue and, as a result, generating positive gross margins from hardware sales is not the primary goal of the hardware business.\nBitcoin costs consist of the amounts we pay to purchase bitcoin that is sold to customers. These costs fluctuate in line with bitcoin revenue.\nAmortization of Acquired Technology Assets\nAmortization of acquired technology assets is primarily comprised of amortization related to the acquired technology assets from the acquisition of Afterpay.\nOperating expenses consist of product development; sales and marketing; general and administrative expenses; transaction, loan, and consumer receivable losses; bitcoin impairment losses; and amortization of customer and other acquired intangible assets. For product development and general and administrative expenses, the largest single component is personnel-related expenses, including salaries, commissions and bonuses, employee benefit costs, and share-based compensation. In the case of sales and marketing expenses, a significant portion is related to the Cash App peer-to-peer transactions and Cash App Card issuance costs, in addition to paid advertising and personnel-related expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, human resources, and IT.\nProduct Development Expenses\nProduct development expenses currently represent the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of expenses related to our engineering, data science, and design personnel; fees and supply costs related to maintenance at third-party data center facilities; hardware related development and tooling costs; software and cloud computing infrastructure fees; and fees for software licenses, consulting, legal, and other services that are directly related to growing and maintaining our portfolio of products and services. Additionally, product development expenses include the depreciation of product-related infrastructure and tools, including data center equipment, internally developed software, and computer equipment. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and expanding our apps, and on enhancing the functionality and ease of use of our offerings. Our ability to realize returns on these investments is substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully address current and emerging requirements of sellers, buyers, and customers through the development and introduction of these new products and services.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses are aggregated into two main components. The first component consists of traditional advertising costs incurred such as direct sales expense, account management, local and product marketing, retail and e-commerce, partnerships, and communications personnel. The second component of sales and marketing expenses consists of costs incurred for services, incentives, and other costs that are not directly related to revenue generating transactions that we consider to be marketing costs to encourage the usage of Cash App. These expenses include, but are not limited to, Cash App peer-to-peer processing costs and transaction losses, card issuance costs, customer referral bonuses, and promotional giveaways that are expensed as incurred.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses related to our customer support, finance, legal, risk operations, human resources, and administrative personnel. General and administrative expenses also include costs related to fees paid for professional services, including legal, tax, and accounting services.\nTransaction, Loan, and Consumer Receivable Losses\nTransaction",
