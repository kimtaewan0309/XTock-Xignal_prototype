Furthermore, in June 2025, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion (expiration on June 24, 2026) which may be used for general corporate purposes including to support our commercial paper borrowings. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.\nAs of September 28, 2025, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $18.6 billion and had approximately $45.8 billion of notes payable and long-term debt for a net debt position of $27.2 billion as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter net debt position of $15.5 billion. In the fiscal first quarter of 2025, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for approximately $9.2 billion. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. acquisition for approximately $14.5 billion which closed on April 2, 2025, and for general corporate purposes. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company’s remaining balance of approximately $3.8 billion related to talc matters, $2.0 billion related to the current portion of Corporate bonds due and the remaining approximately $1.1 billion to settle opioid litigation (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.\nOn July 16, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.30 per share, payable on September 9, 2025, to shareholders of record as of August 26, 2025.\nOn October 14, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.30 per share, payable on December 9, 2025, to shareholders of record as of November 25, 2025. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends.\nNew accounting pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for new accounting pronouncements.\nEconomic and market factors\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the IRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains ongoing and while CMS has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs, implementation of the program is still in progress. In September 2025, a majority of the Third Circuit panel denied Janssen’s appeal of the district court’s decision.\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company operates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey and Egypt (beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nThe long-term implications of regional conflicts on the Company are difficult to predict. The financial impact of known existing conflicts in the fiscal third quarter of 2025 was not material.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company may be further impacted by the imposition of tariffs, trade protection measures or other policies adopted by any jurisdiction that favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors.\nThe Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.\nThe Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar manufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products prior to the expiration of the applicable patents. These challengers file Abbreviated New Drug Applications or abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company’s patents. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also risk that one or more competitors\n\nItem 2 — Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nResults of operations\nAnalysis of consolidated sales\nFor the fiscal nine months of 2025, worldwide sales were $69.6 billion, a total increase of 5.0%, including an operational* increase of 4.7% as compared to 2024 fiscal nine months sales of $66.3 billion.
