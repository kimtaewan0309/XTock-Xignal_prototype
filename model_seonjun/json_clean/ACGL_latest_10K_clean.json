The insurance group focuses on talent-intensive rather than labor-intensive business and seeks to operate profitably (on both a gross and net basis) across all of its product lines. To achieve these objectives, our insurance group’s operating principles are to:\nCapitalize on profitable underwriting opportunities\n. Our insurance group believes that its experienced management and underwriting teams are positioned to locate and identify business with attractive risk/reward characteristics. As profitable underwriting opportunities are identified, our insurance group will continue to grow its product portfolio in order to take advantage of market trends. This includes adding underwriting and other professionals with specific expertise in specialty lines of insurance.\nCentralize responsibility for underwriting\n. Our insurance group consists of a range of product lines. The underwriting executive in charge of each product line oversees all aspects of the underwriting product development process within such product line. Our insurance group believes that centralizing control of such product line with the respective underwriting executive allows for tight management of underwriting and creates clear accountability for results. Our U.S. insurance group has five regional offices, and the executive in charge of each region is primarily responsible for all aspects of the marketing and distribution of our insurance group’s products, including the management of broker and other producer relationships, in the executive’s respective region. In our non-U.S. offices, a similar philosophy is observed, with responsibility for the management of each product line residing with the senior underwriting executive in charge of the relevant product line.\nMaintain disciplined underwriting standards using our experience and strategic analytics to drive decisions\n. Our insurance group’s underwriting philosophy is to generate an underwriting profit through prudent risk selection and proper pricing. Our insurance group believes that the key to this approach is adherence to uniform underwriting standards across all types of business. Our insurance group’s senior management closely monitors the underwriting process. This strategy is underpinned by our belief in using data and strategic analytics to assess business through hard and soft underwriting conditions.\nFocus on providing superior claims management\n. Our insurance group believes that claims handling is an integral component of credibility in the market for insurance products. We believe our ability to handle claims expeditiously and satisfactorily is a key to our\nsuccess. Our insurance group employs experienced claims professionals and also utilizes experienced external claims managers (third party administrators) where appropriate.\nPromote and utilize an efficient distribution system\n. Our insurance group believes that promoting and utilizing a multi-channel distribution system provides efficient access to its broad customer base. We work with select international, national and regional retail and wholesale brokers and leading managing general agencies and program administrators, to distribute our insurance products.\nGrow strategic partnerships, acquire or build strategic businesses in niche areas or lines of business.\nOur insurance group aims to build more integrated long-term alignment with strategic partners offering superior access to niche opportunities, quality scalable businesses, or lines with reliable defensive qualities. We may grow existing partnerships or look to acquire businesses which further this strategy, such as our MCE Acquisition.\nCreate or acquire scalable and diversified underwriting platforms which can flex depending on the underwriting cycle.\nOur experience as cycle managers is complemented by scalable underwriting platforms enabling us to increase or decrease our business as market conditions demand. The MCE platform enhances our U.S. focus on middle market companies using our strategic analytics capabilities and continued focus on customer solutions. We continue to focus on specialty risks as we build out a diversified platform across the insurance segment. Outside of the U.S., we are focused on continued expansion in continental Europe and optimizing opportunities in the London Market.\nUnderwriting Philosophy.\nWe seek to generate an underwriting profit based on our careful analysis across each product line that focuses on the following:\n• desired attachment point;\n• limits and retention management;\n• due diligence, including financial condition, claims history, management, and product, class and territorial exposure;\n• underwriting authority and appropriate approvals; and\n• collaborative decision making.\nWe employ analytic capabilities to support this philosophy.\nOur insurance group’s products are marketed principally through a group of licensed independent retail and wholesale brokers. Clients (insureds) are referred to our insurance group through a large number of international,\nARCH CAPITAL\nnational and regional brokers and captive managers who receive from the insured or insurer a set fee or brokerage commission usually equal to a percentage of gross premiums. Our insurance group may enter into contingent commission arrangements with some brokers that provide for the payment of additional commissions based on volume or profitability of business. It is the practice for the brokers and producers to make the client aware of any contingent commission arrangements that may be in place with us. We have also entered into service agreements with select international brokers that provide access to their proprietary industry analytics. In general, our insurance group has no implied or explicit commitments to accept business from any particular broker and neither brokers nor any other third parties have the authority to bind our insurance group, except in the case where underwriting authority may be delegated contractually to select program administrators. Such administrators are subject to a financial and operational due diligence review prior to any such delegation of authority and ongoing reviews and audits are carried out as deemed necessary by our insurance group to assure the continuing integrity of underwriting and related business operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry, Business and Operations—We could be materially adversely affected to the extent that important third parties with whom we do business do not adequately or appropriately manage their risks, commit fraud or otherwise breach obligations owed to us.” For information on major brokers, see\nnote 18, “Commitments and Contingencies—Concentrations of Credit Risk,”\nto our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nRisk Management and Reinsurance.\nIn the normal course of business, our insurance group may cede a portion of its premium on a quota share or excess of loss basis through treaty or facultative reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance arrangements do not relieve our insurance group from its primary obligations to insureds. Reinsurance recoverables are recorded as assets, predicated on the reinsurers’ ability to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements. If the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under the agreements, our insurance subsidiaries would be liable for such defaulted amounts. Our principal insurance subsidiaries, with oversight by a group-wide reinsurance steering committee (“RSC”), are selective with regard to reinsurers, seeking to place reinsurance with only those reinsurers which meet and maintain specific standards of established criteria for financial strength. The RSC evaluates the financial viability of its reinsurers through financial analysis, research and review of rating agencies’ reports and also monitors reinsurance recoverables and collateral with unauthorized reinsurers. The financial analysis includes ongoing qualitative and quantitative assessments of reinsurers, including a review of the financial stability, appropriate licensing, reputation, claims paying ability and underwriting\nphilosophy of each reinsurer. See\nnote 8, “Reinsurance,”\nto our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nFor catastrophe-exposed insurance business, our insurance group seeks to limit the amount of exposure to catastrophic losses it assumes through a combination of managing aggregate limits, underwriting guidelines and reinsurance. For a discussion of our risk management policies, see\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Ceded Reinsurance”\nand “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry, Business and Operations—The failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.”\nOur insurance group’s claims management function is performed by claims professionals, as well as experienced external claims managers (third party administrators), where appropriate. In addition to investigating, evaluating and resolving claims, members of our insurance group’s claims departments work with underwriting professionals to develop products and services desired by the group’s clients.\nReinsurance Operations\nOur reinsurance operations are conducted on a worldwide basis through our reinsurance subsidiaries, Arch Re Bermuda, Arch Re U.S., our Lloyd’s Syndicates, and Arch Re Europe. Arch Re Bermuda is dual-licensed as a Class 4 general business insurer and Class C long-term insurer and is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda. Arch Re Bermuda has been approved as a “certified reinsurer,” which allows reduced collateral for reinsurance ceded to such reinsurers. Arch Re Bermuda has also been approved as a “reciprocal jurisdiction reinsurer,” which allows ceding companies to eliminate regulatory collateral requirements for reinsurance ceded to such reinsurers and still take credit for that reinsurance. In October 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Fiscal Services (“BFS”) recognized Arch Re Bermuda as an “Alien Reinsurer” (except on excess risks running to the U.S.), which allows T-Listed ceding companies to eliminate regulatory collateral requirements under the U.S. Treasury rules. Arch Re U.S. is licensed or is an accredited or otherwise approved reinsurer in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in Canada with its principal U.S. offices in Morristown, New Jersey. Treaty and facultative operations in Canada are conducted through the Canadian branch of Arch Re U.S. (“Arch Re Canada”). Arch Re U.S. is also an authorized insurer in Guam. Our property facultative reinsurance operations are conducted primarily through Arch Re U.S. The property facultative reinsurance operations have offices throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and the U.K. Arch Re Europe, licensed and authorized as a non-life\nARCH CAPITAL\nreinsurer and a life reinsurer, is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland with branch offices in France, Switzerland and the U.K. AMAL is the managing agent for the reinsurance operations of our Lloyd’s Syndicates.\nArch Group Reinsurance Ltd.
