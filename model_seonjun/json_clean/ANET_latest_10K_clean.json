We also sell in conjunction with various technology partners. To facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity, we have created a partner program, the Arista Partner Program, to engage partners who provide value-added services and extend our reach into the marketplace. Authorized training partners perform technical training of our channel partners and end customers. Our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us, and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders. Our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us.\nOur sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for pre-sales technical support and solutions engineering for our customers, systems integrators, OEMs, and channel partners. In general, the personnel in our sales organization are formed into teams, and each team is responsible for a geographical territory, has responsibility for a number of major direct end-customer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market. A pool of shared channel sales and marketing representatives also supports these teams.\nOur marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences, webinars, web marketing, trade shows, product demonstrations, seminars and events, public relations, analyst relations, demand generation and direct marketing to build our brand, increase end-customer awareness, communicate our product advantages and generate qualified leads for our",
  "item7_clean": "As the global supply chain has experienced some improvements and as customer lead times have been reduced from their peak, we have seen and expect to continue to see a commensurate reduction in visibility to customer demand and a gradual return to shorter demand-planning horizons. Given the timing and prioritization of customer orders and shipment patterns, as well as the timing and outcome of customer trials and contracts with acceptance periods, near term revenue trends may not be reflective of current demand levels, and as discussed above will also benefit from demand/deployment plans that have been previously committed. We expect that our inventory and purchase commitments will\nremain volatile as we ramp new product introductions. The magnitude of these balances, combined with a reduction in customer demand-planning horizons and shifting customer product priorities, has resulted in increased risk that we may not be able to sell all of this inventory, which in turn has resulted in additional excess and obsolete inventory and supplier liability charges. In addition, inflation pressure in our supply chain and scarcity of some materials needed to build our products have increased our cost of revenue and have impacted, and may continue to negatively impact our gross margin. These cost pressures may be increased if escalating tariff and non-tariff international trade measures continue to proliferate in or affect our supply chain. We also may not be able to pass on the full burden of the increase in trade-related costs to our customers, which could further negatively impact our gross margin. While we have seen improvements in our supply chain and manufacturing operations, any remaining or new supply chain and manufacturing related constraints could negatively impact our business in future periods.\nManagement continues to actively monitor the impact of macroeconomic factors on the Company's financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. The extent of the impact of these factors on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, the impact on our customers, partners, employees, contract manufacturers and supply chain, all of which continue to evolve and are unpredictable. In addition, any continued or renewed disruption in manufacturing and supply and new or enhanced tariffs imposed by the U.S. and other countries resulting from these factors could negatively\nimpact our business. Furthermore, any prolonged economic disruptions or further deterioration in the global economy could have a negative impact on demand from our customers in future periods, particularly in the enterprise market where we are continuing to expand our penetration. Accordingly, current results and financial conditions discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nRevenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin (in thousands, except percentages)\nYear Ended December 31,\nTotal cost of revenue\nRevenue by Geography (in thousands, except percentages)\nYear Ended December 31,\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\nProduct revenue primarily consists of sales of our switching and routing products, and related network applications. Service revenue is primarily derived from sales of PCS contracts, which are typically purchased in conjunction with our products, and subsequent renewals of those contracts. We expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing, size, and complexity of orders, especially with respect to our large customers.\nProduct revenue increased by $854.5 million, or 17.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. This\nincrease reflects healthy customer demand and higher shipments of our switching and routing platforms, with strong contributions across our customer base\n. In addition, service revenue increased by $288.5 million, or 34.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base has continued to expand. International revenu\nes as a percentage of our total revenues\n2023 to 18.2% in 2024, which was primarily driven by changes in the geographic mix of sales to our large global customers.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nCost of product revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs of our manufacturing operations, including freight, and other costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory and supply chain. Cost of service revenue primarily consists of\npersonnel and other costs associated with our global customer support and services organizations.\nCost of revenue increased by $282.0 million, or 12.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. These increases were driven by a corresponding increase in product and service revenues, partially offset by reductions of $180.4 million in net excess/obsolete inventory and supplier liability charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition, the mix of sales to large customers who generally receive lower pricing, the mix of products sold, manufacturing-related costs, including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities, merchant silicon costs, and excess/obsolete inventory and supplier liability charges. For example, in order to meet customer lead times, we have, and may continue to expedite the supply of components and make incremental investments in our supply chain to increase our capacity for manufacturing products, which increases our product costs and negatively impacts our gross margin. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above.\nGross margin increased from 61.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023 to 64.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024. These changes reflect an improvement in product margins of 60.9% in 2024 compared to 59.0% in 2023, driven by a reduction of $180.4 million in net excess/obsolete inventory-related charges. In addition, our gross margin benefited in 2024 from the leverage of relatively fixed manufacturing overhead costs on a higher revenue base of $7.0 billion in 2024 compared to $5.9 billion in 2023.\nOperating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages)\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel-related expenses.\n\nCash (used in) financing activities\nEffect of exchange rate changes\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities consist of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $3.7 billion, primarily from net income of $2.9 billion along with a net decrease in working capital requirements of $985.2 million, offset by net non-cash adjustments to net income of $129.0 million. Cash inflows consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $1.3 billion resulting from increased customer PCS contracts and an increase in product deferred revenue related to customer contracts with acceptance terms, and a $110.6 million decrease in inventory resulting from strong product shipments. These cash inflows were partially offset by a $234.2 million increase in other assets driven by increased deferred cost of sales associated with higher product revenue deferrals, an increase in accounts receivable of $106.1 million due to increased product and service billings and a $66.5 million increase in income tax payments due to timing. Net non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of an increase in deferred income taxes of $492.9 million primarily resulting from increased deferred tax assets associated with the increase in deferred revenue and capitalization of research and development costs under IRC Section 174, which were largely offset by $355.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was $2.0 billion, primarily from net income of $2.1 billion, offset by net non-cash adjustments to net income of $37.4 million, and a net change of $15.9 million in working capital requirements. Net non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of an increase in deferred income taxes of $370.8 million primarily resulting from increased deferred tax assets associated with the capitalization of research and development costs under IRC Section 174, which were largely offset by $296.8 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $70.6 million of depreciation, amortization and other expenses. The change in working capital requirements primarily consisted of a $655.5 million increase in inventory in response to a significant increase in business volume, a $101.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to the larger business volume and timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as a $66.4 million increase in other assets primarily driven by increased deferred cost of sales associated with higher product revenue deferrals. These cash outflows were largely offset by a $465.0 million increase in deferred revenue driven by a growth in PCS contracts and increased product deferred revenue related to customer contracts with acceptance terms, a $322.3 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities related to significant business volume, timing of payments, and increased supplier and contract manufacturer liability reserves and a $20.2 million increase in income taxes, net, due to timing of payments.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities primarily consist of our marketable securities investments, business combinations, and capital expenditures.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, cash used in investing activities was $2.5 billion, consisting of purchases of available-for-sale securities of $4.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds of $2.1 billion from maturities and sales of marketable securities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in investing activities was $687.5 million, consisting of purchases of available-for-sale securities of $2.6 billion, and purchases of property, equipment and intangible assets of $34.4 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1.9 billion from maturities of marketable securities, and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $67.3 million,\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur financing activities consist of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee equity incentive plans, offset by repurchases of our common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, cash used in financing activities was $421.8 million, consisting of payments for repurchases of our common stock from the open market of $423.6 million and employee taxes withheld and paid of $58.4 million upon vesting of restricted stock units, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans of $60.2 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in financing activities was $83.7 million, consisting primarily of common stock repurchases of $112.3 million and taxes paid of $33.6 million upon vesting of restricted stock units, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans of $62.1 million.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur material cash requirements will have an impact on our future liquidity. Our material cash requirements represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations not recorded on our balance sheet represent an estimate of all non-cancellable open purchase orders and contractual obligations, made either directly by Arista or by our contract manufacturers on our behalf, in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services. As of December 31, 2024, we had $3.1 billion of such purchase obligations, of which\n$2.8 billion are expected to be received within 12 months, and\nxpected to be received after one year. These open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, and while we may have some limited ability to reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services, this can only occur with the agreement of the related supplier.\nWe have operating lease arrangements for office space, data center, equipment and other corporate assets. As of December 31, 2024, we had lease payment obligations, net of immaterial sublease income, of $65.3 million, with $24.7 million payable within 12 months.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased land and the improvements thereon in Santa Clara, California to construct a building for office, lab and data center space. The estimated capital expenditures related to this project is expected to be approximately $235.0 million to $260.0 million for the next two years, with construction expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2026.\nAccrued Income Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have recorded long-term tax liabilities of $110.0 million related to uncertain tax positions; however, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments.\nIn connection with the TCJA, effective from January 1st, 2022, the TCJA eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 174. As of December 31, 2024, the incremental cash tax impact resulting from the regulation was approximately $210.2 million for the year, of which substantially all the liability has been paid. It is anticipated that IRC Section 174 will result in cash tax outlays exceeding our income tax expense over the next three years unless the current legislation is changed. There is no material change to our effective tax rate as a result of this regulation.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nhistorical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ ",
