  "item1_clean": "Financial Instruments\nForeign Currency Translation;\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products: elastomers, aluminum and plastic. Elastomers include both synthetic and natural materials. We currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers. We are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements. In addition, some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders, which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption.\nWe employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments, which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply. Due to regulatory control over our production processes, sole source availability, and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers, we rely on single-source suppliers for many critical raw materials. We generally purchase certain raw materials in the open market and therefore the results of our operations may be affected by price fluctuations. This strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production or distribution problem. These risks are managed, when and where possible, by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites, rigorous quality control systems, surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production or distribution. Heightened inflation may result in unfavorable conditions, inclusive of an increase in raw material cost. To date, we have been able to manage these conditions without significant disruption to our business.\nWhile we work closely with our suppliers, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful, and there may be events that cause supply interruption, reduction or termination that adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain products. See further discussion of the risks related to the supply chain and raw materials in Item 1A.\nIntellectual Property\nOur intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, know-how and trade secrets, is important to our business. We own or license intellectual property rights, including know-how and issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries, which relate to various aspects of our business. In 2024, more than 170 utility and design patents were issued to West across the globe. Certain key value-added and proprietary products and processes are exclusively licensed from Daikyo. We believe, however, that neither our business nor any business segment is wholly dependent on a single intellectual property asset, license, or technology, by itself.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business activities are global and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations to healthcare, environmental protection, occupational health and safety, anti-corruption, export control, product safety and efficacy, employment, privacy and other areas. The design, development, manufacturing, marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S., Europe and other countries, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the European Medicines Agency and the National Medical Products Administration (China). Regulatory authorities, including regulatory review and oversight, can impact the time and cost associated with the development and continued availability of our products, and they have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against West. Compliance with existing and forthcoming laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming, and may require changes to our information technologies, systems and practices.\nChanges in tax policy or trade regulations, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations did not require material capital expenditures in 2024 and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position in 2025 as compared to prior periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see \"Item 1A.\n\" There were no required material capital expenditures for adherence to our government-led regulatory standards in our facilities in 2024 outside the normal course of business, and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2025.\nWest is also subject to various federal and state laws, and laws outside the United States, concerning fraud and abuse, global anti-corruption, and export control. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement actions with respect to healthcare manufacturers in recent years. We remain committed as a company to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to our business.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various national, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There were no required material capital expenditures for environmental controls in our facilities in 2024 and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2025.\nOur Proprietary Products customers primarily include many of the major biologic, generic, and pharmaceutical drug companies in the world, which incorporate our components and other offerings into their injectable products for distribution to the point of care and ultimate end-user, the patient. Our Contract-Manufactured Products customers include many of the world’s largest pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device companies. Contract-Manufactured Products components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly. Our products and services are sold and distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network, with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors.\nOur ten largest customers accounted for 43.4% of our consolidated net sales in 2024, and one of these customers, individually accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales, at 12.3% or $356.4 million, contributing to net sales in both the Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing reporting segments. Please refer to Note 3,\n, for additional information on our consolidated net sales.\nWith our range of proprietary technologies, we compete with several companies across our Proprietary Products product lines. Competition for these components is based primarily on product design and performance, quality, regulatory compliance, and scientific expertise, along with total cost.\nIn addition, there are a number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical device components, including a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers who are also potential customers of our medical devices and components. We compete in this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management, as well as our knowledge of, and experience in, compliance with regulatory requirements.\nWe have specialized knowledge of container closure components, which is integral to developing delivery systems. With our range of proprietary technologies, we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices, including suppliers of prefillable syringes, auto-injectors, safety needles, and other proprietary systems.\nWe seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition by serving as a global supplier of integrated drug containment and delivery systems that can provide pre-approval primary packaging support and engineering development, analytical lab services and integrated solutions, regulatory expertise, and after-sale technical support. Customers also appreciate the global scope of our manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites.\nOur Contract-Manufactured Products business operates in very competitive markets for its products. The competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global assembly manufacturers. Given the cost pressures they face, many of our customers look to reduce costs by sourcing from low-cost locations. We seek to differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capabilities and reputation and by employing new technologies such as high-speed automated assembly, insert-molding, multi-shot precision molding, and expertise with multiple-piece closure systems.\nResearch and Development Activities\nWe maintain our own research-scale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development. Our quality control, regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components and drug delivery systems. Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in primary packaging, drug delivery and administration technologies.\nCommercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years. New products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices, and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products are subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period.\nWe continue to pursue strategic initiatives in drug containment components, integrated drug containment systems, novel drug delivery devices, novel therapeutic experiences and administration systems.\nWe also continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition, licensing, partnering or development of products, services and technologies.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 10,600 people, excluding contractors and temporary workers, in our operations throughout the world. During 2024\n, West hired approximately 1,800 new team members and experienced an attrition rate of approximately 17%. The following table presents the approximate\npercentage of our employees by region:\nAs of December 31, 2024, the following table presents the approximate percentage of our employees by business unit:\nDigital & Technology (D&T)\nResearch & Development\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had the following global gender demographics:\nWest Global Employees\nTraining, Compliance and Talent Development\nWe strongly encourage our team members to engage in continuous learning and provide development opportunities to strengthen individual skills and gain new experiences with the goal to build talent from within. We offer resources such as our tuition reimbursement program and our online learning catalog, with more than 46,000 courses available. We centrally manage and organize on-the-job training, instructor-led trainings and online trainings in many different languages and topics through our global Learning Management System.\nOur team members live our values (Passion for Customer, Leadership in Quality and One West Team) as they work together to support our mission to improve patients' lives. West’s Code of Conduct, available in multiple languages on westpharma.com, provides guidance to our team members on appropriate and ethical conduct. Every team member is required to ",
  "item7_clean": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nFor the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year-over-year results, we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic net sales exclude the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures and translate the current-period reported sales of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than USD at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period. We may also refer to adjusted consolidated operating profit and adjusted consolidated operating profit margin, which exclude the effects of unallocated items. The unallocated items are not representative of ongoing operations, and generally include restructuring and related charges, certain asset impairments, and other specifically-identified income or expense items. The re-measured results excluding effects from currency translation, the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures, and excluding the effects of unallocated items are not in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are incorporated in our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users with a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position.\nWe are a leading global manufacturer in the design and production of technologically advanced, high-quality, integrated containment and delivery systems for injectable drugs and healthcare products. Our products include a variety of primary proprietary packaging, containment solutions, reconstitution and transfer systems, and drug delivery systems, as well as contract manufacturing, analytical lab services and integrated solutions. Our customers include leading biologic, generic, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device companies around the world. Our top priority is delivering quality products that meet the exact product specifications and quality standards customers require and expect. This focus on quality includes a commitment to excellence in manufacturing, scientific and technical expertise and management, which enables us to partner with our customers in order to deliver safe, effective drug products to patients quickly and efficiently.\nOur business operations are organized into two global segments, Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products. Our Proprietary Products reportable segment offers proprietary packaging, containment solutions and drug delivery systems, along with analytical lab services and other integrated services and solutions, primarily to biologic, generic and pharmaceutical drug customers. Our Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment serves as a fully integrated business, focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex devices, primarily for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers. We also maintain collaborations to share technologies and market products with affiliates in Japan and Mexico.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nWe have operations based in Israel that conduct research and development activities and manufacture certain components for our devices. Our Israel-based facilities continue to substantially operate as they had prior to the conflict in Israel and surrounding area. We continue to monitor the impact of the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas on our operations and those of our suppliers, the possible expansion of such conflict and potential geopolitical consequences, if any, on our business and operations.\nComponents of and Key Factors Influencing Our Results of Operations\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. We believe the items discussed below provide insight into the factors that affect these key measures.\nOur net sales result from the sale of goods or services and reflect the net consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nSeveral factors affect our reported net sales in any period, including product, payer and geographic sales mix, operational effectiveness, pricing realization, timing of orders and shipments, regulatory actions, competition, and business acquisitions that involve our customers or competitors.\nCost of goods and services sold and gross profit\nCost of goods and services sold includes personnel costs, manufacturing costs, raw materials and product costs, freight costs, depreciation, and facility costs associated with our manufacturing and warehouse facilities. Fluctuations in our cost of goods sold correspond with the fluctuations in sales units as well as inflationary and other market factors that influence our cost base.\nGross profit is calculated as net sales less cost of goods and services sold. Our gross profit is affected by product and geographic sales mix, realized pricing of our products, the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and the costs of materials used to make our products.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses relate to our investments in improvements to our manufacturing processes, product enhancements, and additional investments in our elastomeric packaging components, formulation development, integrated drug containment systems, self-injection systems and drug administration consumables.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Our research and development expenses fluctuate from period to period primarily based on the ongoing improvements to our manufacturing processes and product enhancements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs, incentive compensation, insurance, professional fees, and depreciation.\nFinancial Performance Summary\nThe following tables present a reconciliation from U.S. GAAP to non-U.S. GAAP financial measures:\nYear ended December 31, 2024 GAAP\nRestructuring and other charges\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nYear ended December 31, 2024 adjusted amounts (non-U.S. GAAP)\nDuring 2024, we recorded a tax benefit of $19.5 million associated with stock-based compensation.\nYear ended December 31, 2023 GAAP\nRestructuring and other charges\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nLoss on disposal of plant\nCost investment activity\nYear ended December 31, 2023 adjusted amounts (non-U.S. GAAP)\nDuring 2023, we recorded a tax benefit of $32.0 million associated with stock-based compensation.\nYear ended December 31, 2022 GAAP\nRestructuring and other charges\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\nCost investment activity\nRoyalty acceleration\nYear ended December 31, 2022 adjusted amounts (non-U.S. GAAP)\nDuring 2022, we recorded a tax benefit of $16.5 million associated with stock-based compensation.\nDuring 2024, the Company recorded expense to restructuring and other charges of $2.1 million. The net expense represents the impact of two items, the first of which is $4.6 million of expense recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in connection with a plan to optimize the legal structure of the Company and its subsidiaries. The expense consists primarily of consulting fees, legal expenses, and other one-time costs directly attributable to this plan. This expense was partially offset by a $2.5 million benefit recorded within other expense (income) related to revised severance estimates in connection with the Company's 2022 restructuring plan. During 2023, the Company recorded a benefit to restructuring and other charges of $2.0 million, which represents the net impact of a $2.8 million\nenefit within other expense (income) for revised severance estimates in connection with its 2022 restructuring plan and an inventory write down of $0.8 million within cost of goods and services sold. During 2022, the Company recorded expense to restructuring and other charges of $23.8 million, which primarily included a charge of $8.7 million in net severance and post-employment benefits primarily in connection with our plan to adjust our operating cost base and $15.3 million in asset-related charges associated with this plan.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $0.8 million, $0.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of amortization expense within operating profit associated with an acquisition of an intangible asset during the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, during 2024, 2023 and 2022, the company recorded $2.1 million of amortization expense in association with an acquisition of increased ownership interest in Daikyo.\nthe Company recorded expense of $11.6 million as a result of the sale of one of the Company’s manufacturing facilities within the Proprietary Products segment. The transaction closed during the second quarter of 2023.\nDuring 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded cost investment impairment charges of $4.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\n, the Company recorded a benefit of $3.8 million\nwithin other nonoperating expense (income)\nas a result of a favorable legal settlement related to a matter not included in our normal operations.\nDuring 2022, we recorded a gross pension settlement charge of $52.2 million within other nonoperating expense (income), which primarily relates to the full settlement of the U.S. qualified defined benefit plan (the \"U.S. pension plan\").\nPlease refer to Note 15,\nfor further discussion of these items.\nDuring 2022, the Company increased its expected tax benefit related to the prepayment of future royalties from one of its subsidiaries by $1.3 million\nDuring 2022, the Company incurred additional tax expense of $5.7 million due to the impact of a tax law change in the state of Pennsylvania enacted during the period.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe evaluate the performance of our segments based upon, among other things, segment net sales and operating profit. Segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs, which include executive and director compensation, stock-based compensation, certain pension and other retirement benefit costs, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments. Also excluded are items that we consider not representative of ongoing operations. Such items are referred to as other unallocated items for which further information can be found above in the reconciliation from U.S. GAAP to non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Discussion of the year-over-year changes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and the results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 is included in Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations\nPercentages in the following tables and throughout this\nResults of Operations\nsection may reflect rounding adjustments.\nThe following table presents net sales, consolidated and by reportable segment:\nYear Ended December 31,\nProprietary Products\nContract-Manufactured Products\nIntersegment sales elimination\nConsolidated net sales\nConsolidated net sales decreased by $56.6 million, or 1.9%, in 2024, including an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $7.0 million. Excluding foreign currency translation effects and the impact related to the disposal of one of our plants of $4.3 million, consolidated net sales decreased by $45.3 million, or 1.5%.\nProprietary Products –\nProprietary Products net sales decreased by $62.8 million, or 2.6%, in 2024, including an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $6.9 million. Excluding foreign currency translation effects and the impact related to the disposal of one of our plants of $4.3 million, net sales decreased by $51.6 million, or 2.2%, due to a decline in sales of certain High-Value Product (\"HVP\") offerings due to customer inventory management, primarily FluroTec® products, Westar® components and Daikyo® components. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in sales of self-injection device platforms and increased sales prices, which includes approximately $47 million in customer incentives earned in connection with volumes achieved during 2024, as compared to 2023.\nContract-Manufactured Products –\nContract-Manufactured Products net sales increased by $6.2 million, or 1.1%, in 2024, including an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $0.1 million. Excluding foreign currency translation effects, net sales increased by $6.3 million, or 1.1%, primarily due to an increase in sales of self-injection devices for obesity and diabetes and sales price increases, offset by a decrease in sales of healthcare diagnostic devices.\nThe intersegment sales elimination, which is required for the presentation of consolidated net sales, represents the elimination of components sold between our segments.\nThe following table presents gross profit and related gross margins, consolidated and by reportable segment and by unallocated:\nYear Ended December 31,\nProprietary Products:\n\n, for further discussion of our multi-currency revolving credit facility.\nPursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios. In addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants, and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2025.\nWe believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with availability under our multi-currency revolving credit facility, will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nContractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities are expected to result in cash payments in future periods, and include the following material items:\nOur business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers, including for the purchase of raw materials\nand finished goods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024, our outstanding unconditional contractual commitments, including for the purchase of raw materials and finished goods, amounted to $200.7 million, of which $46.7 million is due to be paid in 2025. These purchase commitments are in the normal course of business. The Company previously entered into a material supply agreement for butyl polymers used as a principal raw material in a broad range of the Company’s polymer-based pharmaceutical packaging products.\nOur long-term debt obligations, net of unamortized debt issuance costs including fixed and variable-rate debt, is further discussed in Note 10,\nOur lease obligations primarily related to land, buildings, and machinery and equipment, with lease terms through 2269 further discussed in Note 6,\nOur various tax-qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan obligations in the U.S. and other countries that cover employees and former employees who meet eligibility requirements is further discussed in Note 15,\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions, some of which are subjective and complex, that affect the amounts ",
