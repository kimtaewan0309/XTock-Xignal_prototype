  "item1_clean": "Index to Financial Statements\nPreserve the Flexibility of Our Balance Sheet.\nWe are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure. Our goal is to average through business cycles the following financial ratios: 1) a debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio around 5.5x, 2) a fixed charge coverage of greater than three times, and 3) floating rate debt at less than 20% of total outstanding debt. In addition, we strive to maintain a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, and we seek to maximize the menu of our available sources of capital, while minimizing the cost. Since Digital Realty Trust, Inc.’s initial public offering in 2004, we have raised approximately $74 billion of capital through common (excluding forward contracts), preferred and convertible preferred equity offerings, exchangeable debt offerings, non-exchangeable bond offerings, our Global Revolving Credit Facilities, our term loan facilities, a senior notes shelf facility, secured mortgage financings and re-financings, joint venture partnerships and the sale of non-core assets. We endeavor to maintain financial flexibility while using our liquidity and access to capital to support operations, our acquisition, investment, leasing and development programs and global campus expansion, which are important sources of our growth.\nLeverage Technology to Develop Comprehensive and Diverse Products.\nWe believe we have one of the most comprehensive suites of global data center solutions available to customers from a single provider.\nGlobal Service Infrastructure Platform\n. With our acquisitions, which extended our footprint further across Latin America, Europe and Africa, enhanced our portfolio of scale and hyper-scale data centers in the U.S. and furthered our position as a leading provider of colocation, interconnection and cloud-enablement services globally, we are able to offer one of the industry’s broadest range of data center solutions to meet our customers’ needs, from a single rack or cabinet to multi-megawatt deployments. We believe our products like ServiceFabric™ and our partnerships with managed services and cloud service providers further enhance the attractiveness of our data centers.\nProvide Foundational Services to Enable Customers and Partners.\nWe believe that the platform, through which we offer the foundational services of space, power and connectivity, will enable our customers and partners to serve their customers and grow their businesses. We believe our Internet gateway data centers, individual data centers and data center campuses are attractive to a wide variety of customers and partners of all sizes. Furthermore, we believe our colocation and interconnection offerings, as well as the densely connected data communities that have developed within our facilities, and the availability and scalability of our comprehensive suite of products are valuable and critical to our customers and partners.\nAccelerate Global Reach and Scale.\nWe have strategically pursued international expansion since our IPO in 2004 and now operate across six continents. We believe that our global multi-product data center portfolio is a foundational element of our strategy and our scale and global platform represent key competitive advantages difficult to replicate. Customers and competitors are recognizing the value of interconnected scale, which aligns with our connected campus strategy that enables customers to “land and expand” with us. We expect to continue to source and execute strategic and complementary transactions to strengthen our data center portfolio, expand our global footprint and product mix, and enhance our scale.\nDrive Revenue Growth and Operating Efficiencies.\nWe aggressively manage our properties to maximize cash flow and control costs by leveraging our scale to drive operating efficiencies.\nLeverage Strong Industry Relationships.\nOur global market leadership position and strong industry relationships provide us with a unique vantage point to detect and capitalize on secular trends as they emerge globally. We focus our industry relationship efforts towards market sensing, market shaping and helping to set open standards that benefit companies of all types to derive value from digital infrastructure and multi-tenant datacenters. Industry collaboration includes engagements with industry associations, IT industry analysts, venture capitalists, technology incubators, technology service providers, telecommunications providers, systems integrators and large multi-national companies across segments including manufacturing, transportation and logistics, financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical and digital media. These relationships help us forge new product capabilities, inform investment decisions, develop new routes to market and create differentiated value for customers and drive long-term growth and yield for stockholders.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements\nThrough investments and strategic partnerships, we have significantly expanded our capabilities as a leading provider of interconnection and cloud-enablement services globally. We believe interconnection is an attractive line of business that would be difficult to build organically and enhances the overall value proposition of our data center product offerings. Through product offerings such as our ServiceFabric™ and partnerships with cloud service providers, we can support our customers’ hybrid cloud architecture requirements.\nOur Global Customers\nOur portfolio has attracted a high-quality, diversified mix of customers. We have more than 5,000 customers, and no single customer represented more than approximately 11.5% of the aggregate annualized recurring revenue of our portfolio as of December 31, 2024.\nGlobal Customer Base across a Wide Variety of Industry Sectors\nWe use our in-depth knowledge of requirements for trends impacting cloud and information technology service providers, content providers, network and communications providers, and other data center users, including enterprise customers, to market our data centers to meet these customers’ specific technology needs. Our customers are increasingly launching multi-regional deployments and growing with us globally. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 11.5% of our aggregate annualized recurring revenue as of December 31, 2024. No other single customer accounted for more than approximately 6.4% of the aggregate annualized recurring revenue of our portfolio. Our customers represent a variety of industry verticals, ranging from cloud and information technology services, communications and social networking to financial services, manufacturing, energy, gaming, life sciences and consumer products.\nCloud and IT Services\nDigital Content Providers and Financial Companies\nNetwork and Mobile Services\nFortune 50 Software Company\nFortune 25 Investment Grade-Rated Company\nAT&T\nGlobal Cloud Provider\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nIBM\nLinkedIn Corporation\nLumen Technologies, Inc.\nMeta Platforms, Inc.\nProven Experience Attracting and Retaining Customers\nOur specialized data center salesforce, which is aligned to meet our customers’ needs for global, enterprise and network solutions, provides a robust pipeline of new customers, while existing customers continue to grow and expand their utilization of our technology-enabled services to support a greater portion of their IT needs.\nOur Design, Engineering and Construction Program\nOur extensive development activity, operating scale and process-based approach to data center design and construction result in significant cost savings and added value for our customers. We have leveraged our purchasing power by securing global purchasing agreements and developing relationships with major equipment manufacturers, reducing costs and shortening delivery timeframes on key components, including major mechanical and electrical equipment. See \"We and our customers may experience supply chain or procurement disruptions, or increased supply chain costs, which may lead to delays.\" in Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. Utilizing our innovative modular data center design, we deliver what we believe to be a technically superior data center environment at significant cost savings and reduced time frames. Our access to capital and investment-grade ratings allow us to provide data center solutions for customers who do not want to invest their own capital.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements\nThese diverse and secular industry dynamics are driving greater demand for data center capacity not only from global cloud service providers, but also from businesses across other industries, including IT service firms, social media, content providers and the financial services sector. As companies focus on their core competencies and rely on outsourcing to meet their IT infrastructure needs, they are prioritizing colocation for their data center solutions for various reasons, including to reduce latency in data transfer and increase global presence and connectivity. New technologies need a fast, reliable and flexible foundation to operate, and the importance of offering a full spectrum of power, space and connectivity solutions on a global platform continues to grow.\nWe provide a global data center platform that supports our customers’ digital infrastructure and enables our customers to interconnect with their customers and partners. We solve global coverage, capacity and connectivity needs for companies of all sizes, including the world’s leading enterprises and services providers, through PlatformDIGITAL®, a global data center platform for scaling digital business which enables customers to deploy their critical infrastructure with a global data center provider.\nPlatformDIGITAL® combines our global presence with our Pervasive Data Center Architecture (PDx®) solution methodology for scaling digital business and efficiently managing data gravity challenges. Digital Realty gives its customers access to the connected communities that matter to them with a global data center footprint of over 300 facilities with over 227,000 cross connects in over 50 metros across more than 25 countries on six continents.\nFundamentally, we bring together foundational real estate and innovative technology expertise around the world to deliver a comprehensive, dedicated product suite to meet customers’ data and connectivity needs. We represent an important part of the digital economy that we believe will benefit from powerful, long-term growth drivers.\nWe believe that the growth trends in the data center market, technology, the cloud, internet traffic and internet-based services, combined with cost advantages in outsourcing data center requirements, provide attractive growth opportunities for us as a data center solutions provider. Leveraging deep expertise in technology and real estate, we have an expansive global footprint, impressive scale and a full-spectrum fit-for-purpose product offering in key metropolitan areas around the world. These advantages simplify the contracting process for multinational enterprises, eliminating their need to negotiate with multiple local data center solutions providers. In addition, in areas where high data center construction and operating costs and long time-to-market prohibit many of our customers from building their own data centers, our global footprint and scale allow us to meet our customers’ needs quickly and efficiently.\n\nWe believe that achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns on our business, including on our development pipeline and leasing transactions, will deliver superior stockholder returns. We may continue to build out our development pipeline when justified by anticipated returns. We have established robust internal guidelines for reviewing and approving leasing transactions, which we believe will drive risk-adjusted returns. We also believe that providing an even stronger value proposition to our customers, including new and more comprehensive product offerin",
  "item7_clean": "Total property level operating expenses\nProperty level operating expenses include costs to operate and maintain the properties in our portfolio as well as taxes and insurance.\nTotal stabilized utilities expenses decreased by approximately $183.3 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower power pricing at certain properties in the stabilized portfolio, mainly in EMEA and APAC.\nTotal non-stabilized utilities expenses increased by approximately $44.9 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to:\nan increase of approximately $75.9 million due to higher utility consumption in a growing portfolio of recently completed development sites (with the biggest contributions in Northern Virginia, Portland, Zurich, Cape Town and Johannesburg); the markets with the biggest contributions were Northern Virginia, Portland, Frankfurt, London and Paris);\na decrease in power agreement credits by $28.7 million; and\noffset by a decrease of $59.7 million related to properties sold or contributed in 2023 and 2024.\nThe cost of electric power comprises a significant component of our operating expenses. Any additional taxation or regulation of energy use, including as a result of (i) new legislation that the U.S. Congress may pass, (ii) the regulations that the U.S. EPA has proposed or finalized, (iii) regulations under legislation that states have passed or may pass, or (iv) any further legislation or regulations in EMEA, APAC or other regions where we operate could significantly increase our costs, and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our customers. These matters could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nTotal Rental Property Operating and Maintenance (Excluding Utilities)\nTotal stabilized rental property operating and maintenance expenses (excluding utilities) increased by approximately $50.9 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in data center labor and common area maintenance expense.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements\nTotal non-stabilized rental property operating and maintenance expenses (excluding utilities) increased by approximately $24.2 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher lease and common area maintenance expense in a growing portfolio of recently completed development sites.\nTotal Property Taxes and Insurance\nTotal stabilized property taxes and insurance increased by approximately $21.2 million compared to the same period in 2023 due to a favorable property tax assessment at one of our North American properties realized in early 2023.\nTotal non-stabilized property taxes and insurance decreased $36.8 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily related to properties sold or contributed after December 31, 2023.\nProvision for Impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized impairment charges of approximately $191.2 million, which is recorded as provision for impairment on the consolidated income statement. We determined that certain non-core properties in secondary U.S. markets had carrying amounts that may not be fully recoverable as we determined that we no longer intend to hold these properties long-term. Accordingly, the recorded amounts were reduced to reflect management’s estimate of fair value principally based on sales of similar properties and ongoing negotiations with third parties.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized impairment charges of approximately $118.4 million, primarily due to the decline in fair value of our equity investment in DCRU, which was considered other than temporary due to the length of time and extent to which the fair value of our investment has been less than the carrying value.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses include costs which are either non-cash in nature (such as depreciation and amortization) or which do not directly pertain to operation of data center properties. A comparison of other operating expenses for the respective period is shown below (in thousands).\nYear Ended December 31,\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. of this report and the matters described under Item 1A. Risk Factors. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”\nBusiness Overview and Strategy\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc., through its controlling interest in Digital Realty Trust, L.P. and its subsidiaries, delivers comprehensive space, power, and interconnection solutions that enable its customers and partners to connect with each other and service their own customers on a global technology and real estate platform. We are a leading global provider of data center, colocation and interconnection solutions for customers across a variety of industry verticals. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and our Operating Partnership is the entity through which we conduct our business and own our assets.\nOur primary business objectives are to maximize:\nsustainable long-term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit;\ncash flow and returns to our stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.’s unitholders through the payment of distributions; and\nreturn on invested capital.\nWe expect to accomplish our objectives by achieving superior risk-adjusted returns, prudently allocating capital, diversifying our product offerings, accelerating our global reach and scale, and driving revenue growth and operating efficiencies. A significant component of our current and future internal growth is anticipated through the development of our existing space held for development, acquisition of land for future development, and acquisition of new properties.\nWe target high-quality, strategically located properties containing the physical and connectivity infrastructure that supports the applications and operations of data center and technology industry customers and properties that may be developed for such use. Most of our data center properties contain fully redundant electrical supply systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard cooling systems, raised floor areas, extensive in-building communications cabling and high-level security systems. Fundamentally, we bring together foundational real estate and innovative technology expertise around the world to deliver a comprehensive, dedicated product suite to meet customers’ data and connectivity needs. We represent an important part of the digital economy that we believe will benefit from powerful, long-term growth drivers.\nWe have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure that they meet our financial, technical and other criteria. We expect to continue to acquire additional assets as part of our growth strategy. We intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow. We may continue to build out our development portfolio when justified by anticipated demand and returns.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements\nInterest expense increased approximately $15.1 million compared to the same period in 2023 driven primarily by increased borrowings at Teraco.\nIncome tax expense decreased by approximately $20.8 million as compared to the same period in 2023 due to jurisdictional rate mix in foreign jurisdictions and internal restructurings within the global group.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe sections “Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources — Parent” and “Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources — Operating Partnership” should be read in conjunction with one another to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis. The term “Parent” refers to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding our Operating Partnership. The term “Operating Partnership” or “OP” refers to Digital Realty Trust, L.P. on a consolidated basis.\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources — Parent\nOur Parent does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time, incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company (which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership) and guaranteeing certain unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. If our Operating Partnership or such subsidiaries fail to fulfill their debt requirements, which trigger Parent guarantee obligations, then our Parent will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. Our Parent’s only material asset is its investment in our Operating Partnership.\nOur Parent’s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred stock. Our Parent’s principal source of funding is the distributions it receives from our Operating Partnership.\nAs the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, our Parent has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for our Operating Partnership’s day-to-day management and control. Our Parent causes our Operating Partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as our Parent may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in our Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement.\nAs circumstances warrant, our Parent may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. Any proceeds from such equity issuances would generally be contributed to our Operating Partnership in exchange for additional equity interests in our Operating Partnership. Our Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties, to fund development opportunities and for general working capital purposes, including potentially for the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities.\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. were parties to an ATM Equity Offering\nSM\nSales Agreement dated August 4, 2023 (the “2023 Sales Agreement”). Pursuant to the 2023 Sales Agreement, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. could issue and sell common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $1.5 billion through various named agents from time to time. From January 1, 2024 through February 23, 2024, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. generated net proceeds of approximately $99 million from the issuance of approximately 0.6 million common shares under the 2023 Sales Agreement at an average price of $133.43 per share after payment of approximately $0.6 million of commissions to the agents. The proceeds from the issuances under the 2023 Sales Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2024, were contributed to our Operating Partnership in exchange for the issuance of approximately 0.6 million common units to our Parent Company.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements\n$933 million on the issuance of the 3.875% Guaranteed Notes due 2033 in September 2024;\n$1.1 billion on the issuance of the 1.875% Exchangeable Notes due 2029 in November 2024;\noffset by $740 million on the closing of the U.S. term loan facility in January 2023;\nan increase in cash used for repayment on secured / unsecured debt:\n$740 million on the U.S. term loan facility;\n$637 million on the Euro notes (2.625% notes due 2024);\n$323 million on the 2.750% notes due 2024;\n$415 million on the Euro Term Loan Facilities;\nan increase in cash provided by proceeds from the issuance of:\napproximately 12.0 million shares of common stock, net of costs, for approximately $2.0 billion under our ATM program;\napproximately 12.1 million shares of common stock, net of costs, for approximately $1.7 billion from our equity offering;\noffset by the issuance of approximately 20.0 million shares of common stock, net of costs, for approximately $2.2 billion under our ATM program in 2023; and\nan increase in dividend and distribution payments due to an increased number of common shares and common units outstanding.\nNoncontrolling Interests in Operating Partnership\nNoncontrolling interests relate to the common units in our Operating Partnership that are not owned by Digital Realty Trust, Inc., which, as of December 31, 2024, amounted to 1.8% of our Operating Partnership common units. Historically, our Operating Partnership has issued common units to third party sellers in connection with our acquisition of real estate interests from such third parties.\nLimited partners have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem part or all of their common units for cash based on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock at the time of redemption. Alternatively, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. may elect to acquire those common units in exchange for shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, issuance of stock rights, specified extraordinary distributions and similar events. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 0.2 million common units and incentive units of the Operating Partnership are classified within equity, except for certain common units issued to certain former DuPont Fabros Technology, L.P. unitholders in the Company’s acquisition of DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc., which are subject to certain restrictions and, accordingly, are not presented as permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheet.\nMany of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above. A period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings under our Global Revolving Credit Facilities, borrowings under our Euro Term Loan Facilities and USD Term Loan Facility and issuances of unsecured senior notes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nA critical accounting policy is one that involves management’s use of judgement regarding expected outcomes of uncertain events in order to make estimates and assumptions that are material to an entity’s financial condition and results of operations. Though we base our estimates and assumptions regarding these matters on historical and current conditions as well as future expectations, these estimates and assumptions are subjective in nature. Changes to the estimates and assumptions we make regarding these matters could affect our financial position and specific items in our\n\nAnnualized rent is monthly contractual rent (defined as cash base rent before abatements) under existing leases as of the end of the period presented multiplied by 12. Includes consolidated portfolio and unconsolidated entities at the entities’ 100% ownership level. The aggregate amount of abatements for the year ended December 31, 2024 was approximately $44.3 million.\nOperating expenses primarily consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, property management fees, insurance and site maintenance costs, and rental expenses on our ground and building leases. Our buildings require significant power to support data center operations and the cost of electric power and other utilities is a significant component of operating expenses.\nMany of our leases contain provisions under which tenants reimburse us for all or a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. However, in some cases we are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, othe",
