We are among the largest private employers in the United States (U.S.), and our workforce has varying goals and expectations of their employment relationship, from team members looking to build a career to students, retirees, and others who are seeking to supplement their income in an enjoyable atmosphere. We seek to be an employer of choice to attract and retain top talent no matter their objectives in seeking employment. To that end, we strive to foster a highly engaged and purpose-driven culture where all employees, referred to as \"team members,\" have access to opportunity and growth, enabling our team to deliver business results.\nAs of February 1, 2025, we employed approximately 440,000 full-time, part-time, and seasonal team members.

This includes administering a comprehensive occupational injury- and illness-prevention program and training for team members.\nEffective inventory management is key to our ongoing success, and we use various techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. We achieve effective inventory management by staying in-stock in core product offerings, maintaining positive vendor relationships, and carefully planning inventory levels for seasonal and apparel items to minimize markdowns.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nsection in MD&A provides additional details.\nWe compete with traditional and internet retailers, including department stores, off-price general merchandise retailers, wholesale clubs, category-specific retailers, drug stores, supermarkets, direct-to-consumer brands, and other forms of retail commerce.

During 2024, we\nContinued to emphasize newness and differentiation across our assortment, including a steady flow of exclusive products and designer collaborations, such as:\n2,000 new wellness products introduced in January of 2025—600 of which were exclusive to Target;\nour exclusive official \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book\";\nour large assortment of exclusive Wicked products including Wicked Quenchers from Stanley;\npartnerships with celebrities such as Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Tom Holland, Jennifer Aniston, Ashley Tisdale and more;\nthe Diane von Furstenberg for Target collection;\nThe Cuddle Collab limited-edition collection for pets and pet lovers; and\na limited-time pickleball collection with tennis and lifestyle brand Prince;\nLaunched or expanded several owned brands, including dealworthy\nTM\n— our new low-price line of essentials — and Auden\nTM\nTM\nTM\nTM\n, with 11 of our owned brands exceeding $1 billion in annual sales;\nExpanded the selection of products available on our Target Plus digital marketplace;\nLaunched our reimagined Target Circle loyalty program to deliver an easier and more personalized shopping and saving experience, including a free-to-join option and a paid membership for same-day delivery, as well as the integration of Target Circle Card (formerly RedCard);\nContinued to enhance our Roundel digital media products and services, including through a new self-service buying tool, Roundel Media Studio, and experiential events integrated with marketing activities;\nInvested in new artificial intelligence (AI) technology, including modernized AI-powered inventory management systems and Store Companion, an AI-powered chatbot designed to make team members' jobs easier and enhance the shopping experience;\nOpened 23 new stores, many of which are full-size stores, reflecting our large-format focus and stores as hubs strategy; and\nFulfilled over 65 percent of our digital sales through our same-day fulfillment options (Order Pickup, Drive Up, and Same Day Delivery), which grew 7.7 percent compared to 2023, including double-digit percentage growth in both Same Day Delivery and Drive Up.\nFiscal 2024 included the following notable items:\nGAAP and Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.86.\nNet Sales were $106.6 billion, a decrease of $0.8 billion, or 0.8 percent, from the prior year, driven by one less week in the current year.\nComparable sales increased 0.1 percent, driven by a 1.4 percent increase in traffic and partially offset by a 1.3 percent decrease in average transaction amount.\nOperating income of $5.6 billion was 2.5 percent lower than the 53-week prior-year period.\nTARGET CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\n(dollars in millions)\nDepreciation and amortization (exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales)\nIn 2024, we changed the presentation of revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, consolidating the previous three-line format (Sales, Other Revenue, and Total Revenue) to a single line labeled \"Net Sales\", which reflects all revenues (formerly Total Revenue).\nto the Financial Statements provides additional information. We believe this presentation better reflects our strategy, which includes growing capabilities and business offerings that leverage Target's assets and competitive strengths.\nto the Financial Statements for additional information about a reclassification of prior year amounts to conform with current year presentation.\n2023 consisted of 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks in 2024 and 2022.\nDepreciation and amortization (exclusive of depreciation included in cost of sales) expense rate\nOperating income margin rate\nReflects the impact of a reclassification of prior year amounts to conform with current year presentation. Refer to\nto the Financial Statements for additional information.\nNote: Gross margin is calculated as Net Sales less Cost of Sales. All rates are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by Net Sales. Previously our gross margin rate was calculated based only on Merchandise Sales. The calculation change aligns with our 2024 transition to a single-line revenue presentation on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, with prior period amounts updated to conform to the current year presentation. We also updated prior period gross margin rates to conform to the current year calculations, which resulted in an approximate 1 percentage point increase in our gross margin rate for both 2023 and 2022.\nTARGET CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS\nIndex to Financial Statements\nA discussion regarding Analysis of Results of Operations and Analysis of Financial Condition for 2023, as compared to 2022, is included in Part II, Item 7, MD&A\n\nConsisted of 53 weeks.\nRepresents the add-back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as finance leases. Calculated using the discount rate for each lease and recorded as a component of rent expense within Operating Income. Operating lease interest is added back to Operating Income in the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors.\nCalculated using the effective tax rates, which were 22.2 percent and 21.9 percent for the trailing twelve months ended February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectively. Includes tax effect of $1.3 billion related to EBIT for each of the trailing twelve month periods ended February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, and $35 million and $26 million, respectively, related to operating lease interest.\nTotal short-term and long-term operating lease liabilities included within Accrued and Other Current Liabilities and Noncurrent Operating Lease Liabilities.\nAverage based on the invested capital at the end of the current period and the invested capital at the end of the comparable prior period.\nTARGET CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nIndex to Financial Statements\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities, ranked in order of importance: first, we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business, create sustainable long-term value, and maintain our current operations and assets; second, we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually; and finally, we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals.\nOur year-end cash and cash equivalents balance increased to $4.8 billion from $3.8 billion in 2023. Our cash and cash equivalents balance includes short-term investments of $3.9 billion and $2.9 billion as of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.\nOperating Cash Flows\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $7.4 billion in 2024 compared with $8.6 billion in 2023. The operating cash flow decrease is primarily due to higher income tax payments and the combined impact of inventory and accounts payable activity.\nYear-end inventory was $12.7 billion in 2024, compared with $11.9 billion in 2023. The increase in inventory levels reflects\nearlier inventory receipts compared to the prior year, including to support merchandising strategies; and\ninventory investments in select merchandise categories to support sales growth and an improved in-stock position.\nTARGET CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nIndex to Financial Statements\nCapital Expenditures\nNote: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.\nCapital expenditures in 2024 reflect investments in our strategic initiatives, including investments in both stores and in our supply chain, enhancing our capabilities and guest experience across stores and digital channels. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2024 compared with 2023 primarily reflects a slowdown in store remodel activities.\nWe expect capital expenditures in 2025 of approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, with the majority focused on store assets, including both new stores and remodels, as well as continued investment in supply chain and technology projects. We expect to open about 20 new stores during 2025 and to resume a faster pace of remodel activities compared with 2024.\nWe paid dividends totaling $2.0 billion ($4.44 per share) in 2024 and $2.0 billion ($4.36 per share) in 2023, a per share increase of 1.8 percent. We declared dividends totaling $2.1 billion ($4.46 per share) in 2024 and $2.1 billion ($4.38 per share) in 2023, a per share increase of 1.8 percent. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.\nDuring 2024, we deployed $1.0 billion to repurchase shares. We did not repurchase any shares during 2023. See\nMarket for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nto the Financial Statements for more information.\nTARGET CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nIndex to Financial Statements\nOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities, and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of February 1, 2025, our credit ratings were as follows:\nA2\nA\nA\nP-1\nA-1\nF1\nIf our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically, and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above.\nWe have the ability to obtain short-term financing from time to time under our commercial paper program and credit facilities. In October 2024, we obtained a new committed $1.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in October 2025 and terminated our prior 364-day credit facility. This credit facility and our $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in October 2028 provide a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2024 or 2023. We did not have any balances outstanding under our commercial paper program as of February 1, 2025 or February 3, 2024.\nMost of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facilities also contain a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, as of February 1, 2025, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.\nto the Financial Statements provides additional information.\nFuture Cash Requirements\nWe enter into contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business that may require future cash payments. Such obligations include, but are not limited to, purchase commitments, debt service, leasing arrangements, and liabilities related to deferred compensation and pensions. The\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nprovide additional information.\nWe believe our sources of liquidity, namely operating cash flows, credit facility capacity, and access to capital markets, will continue to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, working capital and capital expenditure requirements, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts. In the\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the\ndevelopment, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Risk Committee of our Board\nof Directors. The following items require significant estimation or judgment:\nTARGET CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nIndex to Financial Statements\nInventory and cost of sales:\nThe vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Our inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses and is adjusted to reflect results of actual physical inventory counts. We generally perform counts at each location annually, with counts taking place throughout the year. A 10 percent increase or decrease in our 2024 year-end inventory shrink reserve would impact our cost of sales by approximately $150 million. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reasonably accurate. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Salability can be impacted by consumer preferences and seasonality, among other factors. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $12.7 billion and $11.9 billion as of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectively, and is further described in\nto the Financial Statements.\nWe receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, promotions, advertising allowances, and markdown allowances. Vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales except in arrangements where the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs and recorded as an offset to those costs. Vendor income earned can vary based on a number of factors, including purchase volumes, sales volumes, and our pricing and promotion strategies.\nWe establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on historical trending and data, this receivable is co",
