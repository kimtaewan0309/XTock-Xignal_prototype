Unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms “Albemarle,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “the Company” mean Albemarle Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAlbemarle is a world leader in transforming essential resources into critical ingredients for mobility, energy, connectivity, and health. Our purpose is to enable a more resilient world. We partner to pioneer new ways to move, power, connect, and protect. The end markets we serve include grid storage, automotive, aerospace, conventional energy, electronics, construction, agriculture and food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We believe that our world-class resources with reliable and consistent supply, our leading process chemistry, high-impact innovation, customer centricity and focus on people and planet will enable us to maintain a leading position in the industries in which we operate.\nWe and our joint ventures currently operate more than 25 production and research and development (“R&D”) facilities, as well as a number of administrative and sales offices, around the world. As of December 31, 2024, we served approximately 1,900 customers in approximately 70 countries. For information regarding our unconsolidated joint ventures, see Note 8, “Investments,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nEffective November 1, 2024, we transitioned our operating structure from two core global business units - Energy Storage and Specialties - to a fully integrated functional model designed to increase agility, deliver significant cost savings and maintain long-term competitiveness. In addition, our Ketjen business continues to be operated under a separate, wholly-owned subsidiary. We will continue to report results across three existing operating segments: Energy Storage, Specialties and Ketjen.\nDuring 2024, we managed and reported our operations under three reportable segments: Energy Storage, Specialties and Ketjen. The segments are organized based on their similar markets, customers, economic characteristics and production processes. Financial results and discussion about our segments included in this report are organized according to these categories except where noted.\nFor financial information regarding our reportable segments and geographic area information, see Note 25, “Segment and Geographic Area Information,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nEnergy Storage Segment\nOur Energy Storage business enables better lithium use through reliable supply and consistent quality. We develop and manufacture a broad range of basic lithium compounds, including lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, and lithium chloride. Lithium is a key component in products and processes used in a variety of applications and industries, which include lithium batteries used in consumer electronics and electric vehicles, power grids and solar panels, high performance greases, specialty glass used in consumer appliances and electronics, organic synthesis processes in the areas of steroid chemistry and vitamins, various life science applications, as well as intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry, among other applications.\nIn addition to developing and supplying lithium compounds, we provide technical services, including the handling and use of reactive lithium products. We also offer our customers recycling services for lithium-containing by-products resulting from synthesis with organolithium products, lithium metal and other reagents. We plan to continue to focus on the development of new products and applications.\nThe global lithium market is highly competitive and growing very rapidly. It is characterized by aggressive expansion and entry from existing and new players, including automotive OEMs, commodity traders, junior miners, and large, well-capitalized diversified miners. Producers are primarily located in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australia. Major competitors in lithium compounds include Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A., Sichuan Tianqi Lithium, Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium, Rio Tinto plc, Pilbara Minerals, Arcadium Lithium, Tesla and a large number of additional Chinese companies. Competition in the global lithium market is increasingly based on index-based market pricing and differentiated via product quality, product diversity, reliability of supply and customer service.\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nRaw Materials and Significant Supply Sources\nWe obtain lithium: (a) by purchasing lithium concentrate from our 49%-owned joint venture, Windfield Holdings Pty. Ltd. (“Windfield”), which directly owns 100% of the equity of Talison Lithium Pty. Ltd., a company incorporated in Australia (“Talison”) that owns the Greenbushes mine, and from our 50%-owned unincorporated joint venture, MARBL Lithium Joint Venture (“MARBL”) in Western Australia, which owns the Wodgina hard rock lithium mine project (“Wodgina”); and (b) through solar evaporation of our ponds at the Salar de Atacama, in Chile, and in Silver Peak, Nevada. In addition, we hold mineral rights in defined areas of Kings Mountain, North Carolina with available lithium resources and we own undeveloped land with access to a lithium resource in Antofalla, within the Catamarca Province of Argentina. See Item 2. Properties, for additional disclosures of our lithium mineral properties.\nOur Specialties business optimizes our portfolio of bromine and highly specialized lithium solutions. Our Specialties business serves a variety of industries, including energy, mobility, connectivity, and health. Specialty products are essential in both internal combustion and electric vehicles, from high-voltage cables and powertrains to airbags and tires. We enable digital innovation focused on safety and reliability, including fire safety compounds. Our fire safety technology enables the use of plastics in high performance, high heat applications by enhancing the flame resistant properties of these materials. End market products that benefit from our fire safety technology include plastic enclosures for consumer electronics, printed circuit boards, wire and cable products, electrical connectors, textiles and foam insulation. In energy, infrastructure for renewable grid and electrified transport is enabled by our fire safety solutions. In health, our lithium specialties products are precursors for many pharmaceuticals, while bromine specialties are used to help ensure safer food and water supplies. Other bromine-based specialty chemicals products include elemental bromine, alkyl bromides, inorganic bromides, brominated powdered activated carbon and a number of bromine fine chemicals. Our value-added lithium specialties products include butyllithium and lithium aluminum hydride. We also develop and manufacture cesium products for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and zirconium, barium and titanium products for various pyrotechnical applications, including airbag initiators. A number of customers of our Specialties business operate in cyclical industries, including the consumer electronics and oil field industries. As a result, demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical.\nOur Specialties business serves markets in the Americas, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, each of which is highly competitive. Product performance and quality, price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract. R&D, product and process improvements, specialized customer services, the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the marketplace. Our most significant competitors are Lanxess AG, Israel Chemicals Ltd and Arcadium Lithium, as well as producers in India and China.\nRaw Materials and Significant Supply Sources\nThe bromine we use is originally sourced from two locations: Arkansas and the Dead Sea. Our bromine production operations in Arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program. In addition, through our 50% interest in Jordan Bromine Company Limited (“JBC”), a consolidated joint venture established in 1999 with operations in Safi, Jordan, we acquire bromine that is originally sourced from the Dead Sea. JBC processes the bromine at its facilities into a variety of end products. See Item 2. Properties, for additional disclosures for our mineral properties. The lithium concentrate used in our lithium specialties products are originally sourced from the same sources as the Energy Storage lithium concentrate noted above.\nOur three main product lines in this segment are (i) Clean Fuels Technologies (“CFT”), which is primarily composed of hydroprocessing catalysts (“HPC”) together with isomerization and alkylation catalysts; (ii) fluidized catalytic cracking (“FCC”) catalysts and additives; and (iii) performance catalyst solutions (“PCS”), which is primarily composed of organometallics and curatives.\nWe offer a wide range of HPC products, which are applied throughout the oil refining industry. Their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil feedstocks and products by removing sulfur, nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock. In addition, they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes. We continuously seek to add more value to refinery operations by offering HPC products that meet our customers’ requirements for profitability and performance in the very demanding refining market.\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nWe provide our customers with customized FCC catalyst systems, which assist in the high yield cracking of refinery petroleum streams into derivative, higher-value products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene. Our FCC additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in FCC units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield, such as propylene, and to boost octane in gasoline. Ketjen offers unique refinery catalysts to crack and treat the lightest to the heaviest feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs.\nWithin our PCS product line, we manufacture organometallic co-catalysts (e.g., aluminum, magnesium, and zinc alkyls) used in the manufacture of alpha-olefins (e.g., hexene, octene, decene), polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), and electronics. Our curatives include a range of curing agents used in polyurethanes, epoxies and other engineered resins.\nThere were more than 700 refineries world-wide as of December 31, 2024. We expect to continue to see some less profitable, typically smaller, refineries shutting down and, over the long-term, being replaced by larger scale and more complex refineries, with growth concentrated in the Middle East, India and South-East Asia. Advances in sustainable aviation fuels, petroleum products and renewable diesel are expected to continue. We estimate that there are currently approximately 600 FCC units being operated globally, each of which requires a constant supply of FCC catalysts. In addition, we estimate that there are approximately 4,000 HPC units being operated globally, each of which typically requires replacement HPC catalysts once every one to four years.\nOur Ketjen segment serves the global market including the Americas, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, each of which is highly competitive. Competition in these markets is driven by a variety of factors. Product performance, quality, price, contract terms, product and process improvements, specialized customer services, the ability to attract and retain skilled technical support, and the maintenance of a good s",

A discussion of our consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading “Financial Condition and Liquidity.”\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nWe are a world leader in transforming essential resources into critical ingredients for mobility, energy, connectivity, and health. Our purpose is to enable a more resilient world. We partner to pioneer new ways to move, power, connect, and protect. The end markets we serve include grid storage, automotive, aerospace, conventional energy, electronics, construction, agriculture and food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We believe that our world-class resources with reliable and consistent supply, our leading process chemistry, high-impact innovation, customer centricity and focus on people and plant will enable us to maintain a leading position in the industries in which we operate.\nSecular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio, cost discipline, broad geographic presence and customer-focused solutions will continue to be key drivers of our future earnings. We continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative, yet commercially viable, clean energy products and services to the marketplace to contribute to our sustainability-based revenue. For example, our Energy Storage business contributes to the growth of clean miles driven with electric vehicles and more efficient use of renewable energy through grid storage; Specialties enables the prevention of fires starting in electronic equipment, greater fuel efficiency from rubber tires and the reduction of emissions from coal fired power plants; and our Ketjen business enhances the efficiency of natural resources through more usable products from a single barrel of oil, enables safer, greener production of alkylates used to produce more environmentally-friendly fuels, and reduced emissions through cleaner transportation fuels. We believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts and ongoing productivity improvements, among other factors, position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur, while softening the negative impact of the current challenging global economic environment.\nWe announced a comprehensive review of our cost and operating structure to maintain a competitive position, unlock near-term cash flow, further generate long-term financial flexibility and drive long-term value creation. This included a reduction of planned capital expenditures in 2024 to focus on significantly progressed, near completion and in startup projects, while deferring spending on certain projects.\nAs part of the actions to optimize our cost structure and strengthen our financial flexibility, we have stopped construction of the Kemerton Trains 3 and 4. In addition, we have put Kemerton Train 2 into care and maintenance. Kemerton Train 1 will continue to operate and activity around it is currently focused on commercialization efforts.\nWe announced a new operating structure, effective November 1, 2024, that transitions from two core global business units - Energy Storage and Specialities - to a fully integrated functional model (excluding Ketjen) designed to increase agility, deliver significant cost savings and maintain long-term competitiveness. We will continue to report results across its three existing operating segments: Energy Storage, Specialties and Ketjen.\nWe entered into a definitive agreement with the BMW Group to deliver battery-grade lithium to enable the automaker to pursue high-performance, premium electric vehicles. This multi-year agreement, which takes effect in 2025, is one of the company’s largest ever globally by volume and value. In addition to supplying the BMW Group with lithium hydroxide, the two companies will partner on technology for safer and more energy dense lithium-ion batteries.\nIn March 2024, the Company raised net cash proceeds of $2.2 billion from the issuance of depositary shares, representing interests of the Company’s Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”). The 2,300,000 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issued in respect of the depositary shares have a $1,000 per share liquidation preference.\nEffective January 1, 2024, we changed our definition of adjusted EBITDA for financial accounting and reporting purposes. The updated definition includes our share of the pre-tax earnings of the Windfield joint venture, whereas the prior definition included our share of Windfield earnings net of tax. This calculation is consistent with the definition of adjusted EBITDA used in the leverage financial covenant calculation in the February 2024 amendment to our revolving, unsecured amended and restated credit agreement dated October 28, 2022 (the “2022 Credit Agreement”). This presentation more closely represents the materiality and financial contribution of the strategic investment in Windfield to the Company’s earnings, and more closely represents a measure of EBITDA.\nWe proactively amended the 2022 Credit Agreement to modify the financial covenants through June 2026 given the market pricing of lithium. The amended results of the modification (a) temporarily increase the maximum leverage ratio permitted by the covenant; (b) add an interest coverage ratio and temporarily decrease the minimum interest coverage ratio permitted by the covenant; and (c) adjust the calculation of the EBITDA and net debt components that form the basis of the calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio. The amendments include certain other amendments to the 2022 Credit Agreement, including certain limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, share repurchases and common dividends.\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nWe announced an innovative agreement with Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., a leading supplier of building materials, to make beneficial use of extracted limestone material from Albemarle’s proposed Kings Mountain Mine project. This agreement is part of the Company’s plan to resume lithium mining operations at the Kings Mountain Mine in an environmentally and socially responsible manner, including opportunities to repurpose byproduct material and enhance the economic benefits for the surrounding community.\nWe introduced a project plan and submitted several state and federal permit applications for the potential redevelopment of the Kings Mountain Mine, one of the few known hard-rock lithium deposits in the United States. The plan includes the proposed site footprint, primary physical features and details of the mining processes. Pending permitting approval and a final investment decision, the mine is anticipated to produce approximately 420,000 tons of lithium-bearing spodumene concentrate yearly, providing a crucial building block for sustainable transportation and to support key defense applications.\nWe published our 2023 Sustainability Report,\nAll the Elements for a Better World\n, detailing updates on sustainability strategy execution and the important progress made toward achieving our sustainability goals.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we increased our quarterly dividend for the 30th consecutive year, to $0.405 per share.\nWe recorded net sales of $5.4 billion during 2024; grew Energy Storage volumes by 19% year-over-year.\nCash flows from operations in 2024 were $702.1 million.\nThe current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve. In particular, we believe that the global market for lithium battery and energy storage, particularly for EVs, remains strong, providing the opportunity to continue to develop high quality and innovative products while managing the high cost of expanding capacity. The other markets we serve continue to present various opportunities for value and growth as we have positioned ourselves to manage the impact on our business of changing global conditions, such as slow and uneven global growth, currency exchange volatility, crude oil price fluctuation, a dynamic pricing environment, an ever-changing landscape in electronics, the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers and increasingly stringent environmental standards. During the course of 2023 and 2024, lithium index pricing dropped significantly. Amidst these dynamics, and despite recent downward lithium price pressure, we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically well-positioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes, optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio primarily through pricing and product development, managing costs and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. We believe that our businesses remain well-positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and long-term trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to changes in economic conditions in these markets.\nHowever, in order to optimize our cost structure and strengthen our financial flexibility, we are taking proactive actions, including certain restructuring activities and reducing planned capital expenditures. As part of these actions, we announced a new operating structure, effective November 1, 2024, that transitions from two core global business units to a fully integrated functional model (excluding Ketjen) designed to increase agility, deliver significant cost savings and maintain long-term competitiveness. We will continue to report results across our three existing operating segments of Energy Storage, Specialities and Ketjen. If lithium index pricing trends further downward or remains at low levels for an extended time, we may need to take additional measures to support growth and financial flexibility, including further restructuring actions.\nAt this time, relating to the current situation in the Middle East, our business operations have continued as normal with some shipping and raw material delays. We are monitoring the situation and will continue to make efforts to protect the safety of our employees and the health of our business.\nWe expect Energy Storage net sales and profitability to decrease year-over-year in 2025 as lithium market prices are at lower levels compared to 2024. Because many of our contracts being index-referenced and variable-priced, our business is generally aligned with changes in market and index pricing. As a result, increases or further decreases in lithium market pricing could have a material impact on our results. We do expect the lower pricing to be partially offset by higher sales volume driven primarily by additional capacity from La Negra, Chile, Meishan and Qinzhou, China. The Meishan, China lithium conversion plant achieved first commercial sales during the second quarter of 2024. We could record inventory valuation charges in 2025 if lithium prices continue to deteriorate during the projected period of conversion and sale. While we ramp up our new capacity, we will continue to utilize tolling arrangements to meet growing customer demand. Global EV sales are expected to continue to increase over the prior year, driving continued demand for lithium batteries.\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\nAs part of the above-mentioned actions to optimize our cost structure and strengthen our financial flexibility, we have stopped construction of the Kemerton Trains 3 and 4. In addition, we have put Kemerton Train 2 into care and maintena",
