Through breakthrough technologies, world-class evidence, and partnerships with clinicians and healthcare stakeholders, our employees are inspired by our patient-focused culture to deliver life-changing innovations to those who need them most. We conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World. Our products are categorized into the following groups: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (“TAVR”), Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (“TMTT”), and Surgical Structural Heart (“Surgical”).\nOn September 3, 2024, we sold our Critical Care product group (“Critical Care”). In addition, as a next step in our disposal plan to exit businesses that are not focused on implantable medical innovations for structural heart disease, we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell a non-core product group for $85 million up-front consideration, subject to customary adjustments, and additional earnouts of up to $40 million. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025. We concluded that Critical Care met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale in June 2024 and that the non-core product group met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale in September 2024. We determined that, when considered together, the conditions for discontinued operations presentation had been met with respect to Critical Care and the non-core product group (collectively, the “discontinued product groups”). As such, the historical financial condition and results of the discontinued product groups have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated condensed financial statements. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the discontinued operations presentation. Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations is reflective of our continuing operations. See Note 4 to the\nConsolidated Condensed Financial Statements\nfor further information.\nIn response to recent changes to U.S. trade policy, such as increased tariffs on imports and including non-U.S. retaliatory tariffs, we have and will continue to assess potential impacts on our business. As needed, we will pursue options to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including through our supply chain and potential exemptions and exclusions. Failure to sufficiently mitigate the impact of tariffs, including significant inflation and other impacts on our customers, could also reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Given the uncertainties around U.S. trade policy and future tariff rates, we are unable to predict the nature of the tariffs and whether we will be able to successfully mitigate their impact.\n\nC\nLoss on impairment of $47.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 included loss on impairment related to our determination to not exercise an option to acquire one of our VIE investments (see Note 6 to the\nConsolidated Condensed Financial Statements)\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside the United States which have statutory tax rates typically lower than the United States tax rate. Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in the various locations and the applicable rates.\nOur effective income tax rate attributable to continuing operations was 16.1% and 10.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 16.1% and 9.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in the effective rate between the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was primarily due to\nan increase in global minimum tax (“Pillar Two,” as noted below), a decrease in the tax benefit from employee share-based compensation, and a decrease in the benefit from favorable global income tax audit settlements. In addition, the effective rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to (1) foreign earnings taxed at lower rates, (2) United States f\nederal and California research and development credits, and (3) the tax benefit from employee share-based compensation. The effective rates include a tax benefit (shortfall) from employee share-based compensation attributable to continuing operations of\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nMany countries are implementing some or all of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar Two (“Pillar Two”) rules that impose a global minimum tax of 15% on reported profits. Although Pillar Two provides a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar Two slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar Two. In addition, in January 2025, the United States issued an executive order announcing opposition to aspects of these rules. As countries continue to enact and refine the Pillar Two rules, we will evaluate the potential effects of Pillar Two on our effective tax rate. In 2025, we expect the Pillar Two provisions to result in additional tax expense of approximately $50 million.\nIn the normal course of business, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other taxing authorities are in different stages of examining various years of our tax filings. During these audits, we may receive proposed audit adjustments that could be material. Therefore, there is a possibility that an adverse outcome in these audits could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach an agreement with a tax authority at any time. While we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is materially different from that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law. We believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we executed an Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”) between Japan and Switzerland covering distribution transactions for tax years 2020 through 2024, and in 2023, we executed an APA between Japan and the United States covering tax years 2020 through 2024. We also executed an APA in the fourth quarter of 2024 between Japan and Singapore covering tax years 2022 through 2026 with roll-back terms to cover the distribution of TAVR products beginning in 2020 and the distribution of Surgical products beginning in 2018. Also in the fourth quarter of 2024, we filed with the Japanese tax authorities an APA renewal application between Japan and the United States covering tax years 2025 through 2029. We filed the APA renewal application with the United States tax authorities in the first quarter of 2025 and are engaged in ongoing discussions.\n\nC\nOur gross profit increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily driven by our sales growth discussed above. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily driven by a 1.1 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency rate fluctuations, including the settlement of foreign currency hedging contracts, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and higher operational expenses for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nSelling, General, and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to (a) higher field-based personnel-related costs in support of our growth strategy initiatives, primarily in the United States (b) increased performance-based compensation expenses, and (b) increased professional services costs to support the transition services agreement. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased expenses by $7.3 million and $1.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to the weakening of United States dollar against the Euro.\n\nC\nResearch and Development (“R&D”) Expenses\nR&D expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to increased clinical activity related to our recent investments in implantable heart failure management innovations and higher performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by decreased investments in our transcatheter aortic valve innovations.\nCertain Litigation Expenses\nWe incurred certain litigation expenses related to legal proceedings, intellectual property litigation and tax litigation of $90.4 million and $10.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $116.8 million and $27.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively (See Note 11 to the\nConsolidated Condensed Financial Statements\nChang"
