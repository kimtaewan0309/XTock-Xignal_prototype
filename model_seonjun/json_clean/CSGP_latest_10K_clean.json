This Report also refers to our websites, but information contained on those sites is not part of this Report.\nCoStar Group is a global leader of commercial and residential real estate information, analytics, and online marketplaces. Our mission is to digitize the world's real estate, empowering all people to discover properties, insights, and connections that improve their businesses and lives.\nWe own and operate leading online marketplaces for real estate in the U.S. and the U.K., based on the numbers of unique visitors and site visits per month; provide more information, analytics, and marketing services than many of our competitors; offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available; and have the largest commercial real estate research department in the industry. We have created and compiled a standardized platform of online marketplace services, information, and analytics where industry professionals, consumers of real estate, and the related business communities can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently accessing and exchanging accurate and standardized real estate-related information.\nOur major brands include CoStar, a leading global provider of commercial real estate data, analytics and news; Apartments.com, a leading platform for apartment rentals, based on total revenue; LoopNet, the most trafficked commercial real estate marketplace; and Homes.com, the fastest-growing residential real estate marketplace, based on traffic.\nCoStar Group’s industry-leading brands include STR, a global leader in hospitality data and benchmarking, Ten-X, an online platform for commercial real estate auctions and negotiated bids and OnTheMarket, a leading residential property portal in the U.K.\nOur strategy is to provide real estate industry professionals and consumers with critical knowledge to explore and complete transactions by offering the most comprehensive, timely, and standardized information on real estate, and the right tools to be able to effectively utilize that information. Over time, we have expanded, and we continue to expand, our services for real estate online marketplaces, information, and analytics to continue to meet the needs of the industry as it grows and evolves.\nOur standardized platform includes the most comprehensive proprietary database of commercial real estate information in the industry; the largest research department in the commercial real estate industry; proprietary data collection, information management, and quality control systems; a large in-house product development team; a broad suite of web-based information, analytics, and online marketplace services; a large team of analysts and economists; risk management tools; and a large, diverse base of clients.\nWe have spent more than 35 years building and acquiring databases of real estate information, which includes information on homes, school, communities, commercial properties, leasing, sales, comparable sales, tenants, and demand statistics, as well as digital images, drone videos, and 3-D tours, plat maps, and floor plans. This highly complex database is comprised of hundreds of data fields, tracking such categories as location, site and zoning information, building characteristics, space and unit characteristics and availability, tax assessments, true ownership, sales and lease comparables, residential rents, vacancies and concessions, space requirements, retail locations, mortgage and deed information, for-sale and for-lease listings, fund data, income and expense histories, tenant names, tenant credit scores, view of company locations, lease expirations, contact information, historical trends, forecasts, and demographic information. In addition to our internal efforts to grow the database, we have obtained and assimilated a number of proprietary databases. Our comprehensive commercial real estate database powers our information services, sources data used in our analytic services, and provides content for most of our online marketplace services and our auction platform. Our ability to utilize the same commercial real estate information across our standardized platform creates efficiencies in operations and improves data quality for our customers.\nWe deliver our comprehensive commercial real estate information content to our customers primarily via an integrated solution of online service offerings that includes information about space available for-lease, comparable sales information, information about properties for-sale, tenant information, internet marketing services, risk management tools, analytical capabilities, information for clients’ websites, information about industry professionals and their business relationships, data integration, and industry news. We also operate complementary online marketplaces for commercial and residential real estate listings and apartment rentals, as well as a commercial real estate auction platform. We strive to cross-sell our services to our customers to best suit their needs.\nResearch Department.\nOur research professionals undergo an extensive training program so that we can maintain consistent research methods and processes throughout our research department. Our researchers collect and analyze commercial real estate information through phone calls, e-mails, and additional research methods including field inspections, public records review, news monitoring, third-party data feeds, and user entered content. We have also set up direct feeds from larger apartment sites, owners, and brokers.\nOur researchers are responsible for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of our database information, training our clients to use CoStar Group products, and handling their customer service questions, creating a \"one-touch\" approach to customer care. Because of the importance commercial real estate professionals place on our data and our prominent position in the industry, many of these professionals routinely take the initiative and proactively report available space and transactions through our online tool, which we refer to as our Marketing Center, or directly to our researchers.\nOur field research efforts include physical inspections of properties to research new availabilities, find additional property inventory, identify new construction, collect tenant information, verify existing information, photograph properties, and create high quality videos of interior spaces (including walk-through videos and 3-D virtual tours), amenities, and exterior features of properties. A typical site inspection of a commercial property consists of photographing the building, capturing interior images, videos, and 3-D tours, measuring the building, geo-coding the building, capturing “for-sale” or “for-lease” sign information, counting parking spaces, assessing property condition and construction, and gathering tenant information. Field researchers also canvass properties, collecting tenant data suite-by-suite. We also utilize a low-flying airplane and a fleet of drones to conduct aerial research of commercial real estate. We place researchers on the low-flying aircraft to scout new commercial developments and take aerial photographs and videos.\nWe are leveraging our capabilities developed from our extensive commercial real estate research efforts to produce original, media rich content of neighborhoods, schools, parks, and condominium buildings' amenities, and common areas for our residential products using professional photographers and a fleet of drones to conduct aerial research of residential real estate.\nData and Image Providers.\nWe license a small portion of our data and images from public record providers and third-party data sources. Licensing agreements with these entities allow us to use a variety of commercial real estate information, including property ownership, tenant information, demographic information, maps, aerial photographs, and 3-D virtual apartment tours of apartment communities, all of which enhance our services. These license agreements generally grant us a non-exclusive license to use the data and images in the creation and supplementation of our online marketplaces, information, and analytics.\nOur principal online commercial real estate information and analytics services and online marketplaces are:\nCoStar offers a subscription-based platform for commercial real estate intelligence with several key features:\nProvides a comprehensive inventory of various property types, including office, industrial, retail, multifamily, hospitality, student housing, and land.

  "item7_clean": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains “forward-looking statements,” including statements about our beliefs and expectations. There are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those stated above in under the heading “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” and in Item 1A. under the heading “Risk Factors,” as well as those described from time to time in our filings with the SEC.\nOur principal online marketplace services, information, and analytics are described in the following paragraphs by type of service:\nCoStar is our subscription-based integrated platform for commercial real estate intelligence, which includes information about commercial real estate properties, properties for sale, comparable sales, tenants, space available for lease, industry professionals and their business relationships, industry news and market status and provides benchmarking for the hospitality industry, lease analytical capabilities, and risk management capabilities for lenders. We expect CoStar's revenue growth rate for the year ending December 31, 2025 to decelerate compared to the revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to a lack of benefit from converting legacy STR customers to our new CoStar-based benchmarking product realized in 2024.\nInformation Services\nWe provide real estate and lease management technology solutions, including lease administration, lease accounting, transaction management, and professional services through our CoStar Real Estate Manager and Visual Lease service offerings. We also provide data and reports on an ad hoc basis to customers in the hospitality industry. We expect Information Services' revenue growth rate for the year ending December 31, 2025 to accelerate compared to the revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 as a result of the Visual Lease Acquisition.\nApartments.com is the flagship brand of our apartment marketing network of subscription-based advertising services and provides property management companies and landlords with a comprehensive advertising destination for their available rental units. In addition, it offers renters a platform for searching for available rentals and earns transaction-based revenue primarily from providing online tenant applications, including background and credit checks, and rental payment processing. We expect Multifamily's revenue growth rate for the year ending December 31, 2025 to moderate compared to the revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the impact in 2025 of pivoting the Apartments.com sales force to support the Homes.com product launch in 2024.\nOur LoopNet Network of commercial real estate websites offer subscription-based, online marketplace services that enable commercial property owners, landlords, and real estate agents working on their behalf to advertise properties for sale or for lease. Commercial real estate agents, buyers, and tenants use the LoopNet Network of online marketplace services to search for available property listings that meet their criteria. We expect LoopNet's revenue growth rate for the year ending December 31, 2025 to be consistent with the revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nHomes.com offers real estate agents subscription memberships promoting the agent's home listings and profile on our websites. Homebuyers and real estate agents use Homes.com to find\nhomes using our proprietary research and neighborhood content combined with listing information. OnTheMarket is a property portal in the U.K., which primarily hosts agents' listings on a subscription basis. We expect Residential's revenues for the year ending December 31, 2025 to increase, but at a slower rate, compared to the year ended December 31, 2024 due to additional sales of our Homes.com memberships.\nOur other marketplaces include Ten-X, an online auction platform for commercial real estate, our Land.com Network, and our BizBuySell Network. The Land.com Network provides online marketplaces for rural lands for sale and BizBuySell Network provides online marketplaces for businesses and franchises for sale. We expect Other Marketplaces' revenues for the year ending December 31, 2025 to increase compared to the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to increased revenues from our Land.com and BizBuySell Networks.\nSubscription-based Services\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from service offerings that are distributed to our customers under subscription-based agreements that typically renew automatically and have a term of at least one year. We recognize subscription revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our annualized net new bookings of subscription-based services on all contracts were approximately $250 million, $286 million, and $305 million, respectively. Net new bookings is calculated based on the annualized amount of change in the Company's sales bookings resulting from new subscription-based contracts, changes to existing subscription-based contracts, and cancellations of subscription-based contracts for the period reported. Net new bookings is calculated on all subscription-based contracts without regard to contract term. Net new bookings is considered an operating metric that is an indicator of future subscription revenue growth and is also used as a metric of sales force productivity by us and investors. However, information regarding net new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. We generally see higher net new bookings of Apartments.com listing services during the peak summer rental season and higher CoStar net new bookings towards the end of the year; however, sales fluctuate from year-to-year and revenue is not generally seasonal because our services are typically sold on a subscription basis. Revenues from our subscription-based contracts were approximately 96%, 95%, and 93% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The increase in the percentage of our revenues from subscription-based contracts from 2023 to 2024 was due to increased sales in our Multifamily products.\nFor the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our contract renewal rates for subscription-based services for contracts with a term of at least one year were approximately 89%, 90%, and 90%, respectively; and, therefore, our cancellation rates for those services for the same periods were approximately 11%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. Our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results. As a result, we believe that the rate may be a reliable indicator of short-term and long-term performance absent extraordinary circumstances. Our trailing 12-month contract renewal rate may decline as a result of negative economic conditions, consolidations among our clients, reductions in customer spending, or decreases in our customer base. Revenues from our subscription-based contracts with a term of at least one year were approximately 81%, 82%, and 80% of total revenues for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The decrease in the percentage of our revenue from subscription-based contracts with a term of at least one year from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to increases in sales of shorter-term Multifamily products.\nDevelopment, Investments, and Expansion\nWe plan to continue to invest in our business and our services, evaluate strategic growth opportunities, and pursue our key priorities as described below. We are committed to supporting, improving, and enhancing our online marketplace solutions, information, and analytics, including expanding and improving our offerings for our client base and site users, including property owners, property managers, buyers, commercial tenants, and residential renters and buyers. We expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services, introduce new services, integrate and cross-sell services, integrate recently completed acquisitions, and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research, sales, and marketing organizations. We may reevaluate our priorities as economic conditions continue to evolve.\nOur key priorities for 2025 currently include:\nContinuing to invest in and develop Homes.com. In 2024, we launched Homes.com memberships giving real estate agents the ability to advertise and promote their listings on our website featuring original, media rich content. In 2025, we plan to continue hiring our dedicated Homes.com sales force. We plan to continue to raise unaided brand awareness of the site through targeted marketing campaigns and to continue to focus on attracting recurring visitors to the site. In addition, we plan to develop and market additional products.\nContinuing to expand our CoStar and LoopNet products internationally. We continue to increase our international research team to collect data in European markets. We plan to launch our LoopNet brand in France and Spain and continue to expand our footprint of commercial listings.\nUsing the aggregate and anonymized data from leases within CoStar Real Estate Manager and Visual Lease to create a trusted source of pricing and occupancy information for Commercial Real Estate. We also plan to begin the integration of the CoStar Real Estate Manager and Visual Lease products.\nWe expect our investment in the sales force will increase our selling and marketing expenses for the year ending December 31, 2025 compared to the year ended December 31, 2024. We intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in\nour business in order to develop and distribute new services and functionality within our current platform or expand the reach of, or otherwise improve, our current service offerings. Any future product development or expansion of services, combination and coordination of services, or elimination of services or corporate expansion, development, or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures. Any new investments, changes to our service offerings, or other unforeseen events could cause us to experience reduced revenues or generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future. Any development efforts must comply with our credit facility, which contains restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow and may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business.\nFor further discussion of our Company, strategy, and products, see our business overview set forth in \"Item 1. Business\" in this Report.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our public releases, investor conference calls, and filings with the SEC. The non-GAAP financial measures that we may disclose include EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin. EBITDA is our net income before interest income or expense, net, other expense or income, net, loss on debt extinguishment, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We typically disclose EBITDA on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls, and filings with the SEC. Adjusted EBITDA is different from EBITDA because we further adjust EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues for the period.\nWe may disclose adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls, and filings with the SEC. The non-GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Also, in the future, we may disclose different non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when viewed with our GAAP results and accompanying reconciliations, provide additional information to investors that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business without the impact of certain acquisition-related items. We have spent more than 30 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Due to these acquisitions, our net income has included significant charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation and other amortization, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, and loss on debt extinguishment. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business, apart from charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation and other amortization, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs; settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business. We believe the disclosure of non-GAAP measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year without the impact of these items. We also believe the non-GAAP measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non-cash charges, such as amortization and depreciation, and other items, such as interest income or expense, net, other expense or income, net, income taxes, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, loss on debt extinguishment, and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business, provides additional information about our cost structure, and, over time, helps track our operating progress. In addition, investors, securities analysts, and others have regularly relied on EBITDA and may rely on adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry.\nSet forth below are descriptions of financial items that have been excluded from net income to calculate EBITDA and the material limitations associated with using this non-GAAP financial measure as compared to net income:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the diminishing value of any acquired trade names and other intangible assets and the use of our acquired technology, which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges relate",
