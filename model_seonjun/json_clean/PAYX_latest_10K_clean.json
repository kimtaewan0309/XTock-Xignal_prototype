We continually invest in new demand generation, sales tools, go-to-market strategies along with channel partnerships, ecommerce, and digital marketing.\nExpanding our share of wallet.\nWe offer a full-suite of integrated solutions incorporating a unique combination of industry-leading HR technology and HR advisory solutions that sets us apart in the industry. We intend to continue to increase penetration across our HCM software, HR outsourcing, retirement, and insurance offerings.\nDriving technology innovation\nWe continue to invest significantly in our proprietary, award-winning HCM platforms to maximize efficiency and functionality for our clients and their employees. We have a robust product roadmap that is focused on enhancing our ability to address the needs of our customers and prospective customers. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the AI opportunity with large and growing data sets, predictive analytics and AI models, and increased AI investments to improve efficiency, enhance the customer experience, and unlock new growth opportunities.\nPursuing strategic acquisitions\nWe utilize acquisitions, when appropriate, as a means to expand our portfolio, enter new markets, or increase our scale. We will continue to evaluate and monitor potential acquisitions and target acquisitions that are aligned with our overall strategy.\n\nWe deliver an integrated suite of HCM solutions through three technology platforms that enable seamless workforce management throughout the employee life cycle from recruiting and hiring to retirement. SurePayroll serves the digitally driven small business self-service market. Paychex Flex is our proprietary HCM Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) platform for small and medium-sized businesses. Paycor is our primary SaaS-based HCM platform for larger businesses with more complex needs. Clients can select the modules they need and easily customize solutions as they grow including Payroll, HR, Talent Acquisition, Talent Management, Benefits Administration and Workforce Management.\n\nRetirement solutions:\nOur retirement solutions offer a variety of options to employers, including 401(k) plans, SIMPLE and SEP IRAs, and Pooled Employer Plans, among others. These solutions provide plan implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations, employee and employer reporting, participant and employer online access, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative services. Clients may choose from a group of pre-defined fund selections or customize their investment options within their plan. We are the largest 401(k) recordkeeper for small businesses in the U.S. Our large-market retirement solutions include relationships with financial advisors.\n\nIn addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we utilize other indirect sales channels such as our relationships with existing clients, certified public accountants (“CPAs”), benefit brokers, and banks for new client referrals. More than 50% of our payroll clients come from these referral sources. Our dedicated business development group drives sales through banking, national associations, and franchise channels. Complementing our direct sales, our Embedded HCM Solution partnerships efficiently extend our distribution while providing a modern, holistic solution to customers. We also utilize digital marketing to promote our solutions.\n\nWorkforce management\nComprehensive workforce management solutions to optimize labor costs and enhance productivity through integrated time and attendance, scheduling, and labor management tools. Paychex integrates these capabilities within its core platform, providing features for job costing, labor distribution, and expense management for detailed control over operational spending. For upmarket and enterprise clients, the offering emphasizes automation and analytics, featuring AI-powered labor forecasting, real-time overtime insights, and robust employee self-service capabilities for tasks like mobile punch-in and shift trading.\n\nWe own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Collectively, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us.\n\nThere is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement solutions clients, and new worksite employees associated with our HR Outsourcing businesses tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many businesses prefer to start using our solutions at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to year-end bonus payments, additional year-end services, and the preparation and delivery of end-of year reporting requirements.\n\nComprehensive cloud-based HCM platforms optimized to meet clients' HR and payroll needs;\nExpertise in HR and payroll backed by approximately 250 compliance experts and over 650 HR business professionals;\nStreamlined workforce management that combines technology with flexible, tech-enabled support options;\nModern, mobile, and intuitive user experience with self-service capabilities;\nScalable and customizable platforms that provide clients the flexibility to add solutions as they grow;\nSoftware as a service, or “SaaS”, delivery model that reduces total cost of ownership for our clients; and\nAdvanced data analytics and artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities powered by large data sets.\n\nWe also have long-standing relationships with health insurance and retirement benefits brokers, including large national partners. We recently launched the Partner+ Program to foster broker relationships and drive mutual growth. We now have a broader suite of solutions to offer brokers, which can supplement their offerings to clients, and the Partner+ Program provides a structured framework designed to safeguard mutual clients from competing products. In addition, our Partner Portal provides brokers exclusive access to advanced HCM solutions, new revenue streams, and data-driven insights.\n\nWe also provide comprehensive HR outsourcing through our administrative services organization (“ASO”) and professional employer organization (“PEO”) solutions. We have over 650 HR business professionals who are dedicated to our clients and have the experience and training to provide HR best practices and advice. Our HR business partners are available to provide our ASO and PEO clients with guidance on HR issues. The integration of leading-edge technology and flexible support options enables us to meet our clients’ needs, from the tactical to the strategic.\n\nThe market for HCM solutions is highly competitive and fragmented. We have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national, international, regional, local, and online payroll providers. In addition to traditional payroll processing and HR solution providers, we compete with in-house payroll and HR systems and departments. We believe our solutions also compete with a variety of providers of HR services, such as retirement solutions companies, insurance companies, HR and benefits consulting firms, and national and regional PEOs.\n\nOur HR solutions allow businesses to outsource and simplify their HR administration and compliance support. These bundled services incorporate integrated HCM technology solutions and HR advisory services through both virtual and on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative. Clients can opt for different levels of HR outsourcing from our low-touch HR solutions to our full-service HR Pro package. We also offer HR support to non-payroll clients through our HR Partner Plus solution.\n\nCompetition in the HCM industry is primarily based on the breadth of offerings, technology, ease of use, integration with third-party applications, service model, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas. Our leading-edge technology and mobile applications, combined with personalized support provided by industry professionals and our technology-enabled solution capabilities, differentiate us from our competitors.\n\nOur corporate website is available at\n, and is a cost-efficient channel that serves as a source of leads and new sales, while complementing the efforts of our direct, indirect, and virtual sales forces. The website enables us to market to existing and prospective clients that want to learn more about our solutions and support, and offers information about our core business solutions: human resources, payroll, benefits, and insurance.\n\nEach of these values guide our decision-making process and are critical to our ongoing success. All employees are required to verify their understanding and observance of these values during our annual “Right Way” training, review these values with management during periodic performance discussions, and are further encouraged to attend ongoing training during the year. Volunteer “Culture Champions” throughout the Company also help promote these values daily. We encourage employee feedback through our employee engagement surveys, as described below. This approach empowers our employees and allows us to make a positive impact in the communities we work and serve. As a result of our commitment to these principles, in 2025 we were recognized by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies. Paychex is one of only three companies to have achieved this recognition 17 times, doing so consecutively since 2012.\n\nInsurance solutions:\nOur licensed insurance agency, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., provides insurance through a variety of carriers, allowing employers to expand their employee benefit and corporate offerings at an affordable cost. Insurance offerings include property and casualty coverage such as workers’ compensation, business-owner policies, cybersecurity protection, commercial auto, and health and benefits coverage, including health, dental, vision, and life. Our insurance solutions simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find plans with the features and affordability to meet the client’s needs. With access to numerous top national and regional insurance carriers, our professional insurance agents have access to a wide selection of plans from which they can best match the insurance needs of small businesses. Additionally, clients can integrate their insurance plans with Paychex payroll processing for easy, accurate plan administration.\n\nWe market our solutions through a combination of direct and virtual sales forces supported by various digital lead generation and multi-channel marketing initiatives. Over 50% of our revenues are from solutions other than payroll processing.\n\nWe have a long-standing partnership with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business Solutions\nProgram. Our current partnership agreement with the AICPA is in place through September 2027. We also partner with numerous state CPA society organizations. We provide a free online portal, Paychex Partner Pro, designed to provide accountant",
