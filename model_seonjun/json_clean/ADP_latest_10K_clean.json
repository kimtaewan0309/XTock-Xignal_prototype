With ADP COS, the day-to-day payroll process becomes our responsibility, freeing up clients to address critical issues like employee engagement and retention. The combination of technology, deep expertise and data-driven insights that ADP COS offers is powerful, allowing clients to focus on strategy and results.\nOur premier global solutions consist of multi-country and local in-country solutions for employers of any type or size. We partner with clients to help them navigate the most complex HR and payroll scenarios using tailored and scalable technology supported by our deep compliance expertise.\nADP Global Payroll is a solution for multinational organizations of all sizes, empowering them to harmonize HCM strategies in over 140 countries and territories globally. This improves visibility, control and operational efficiency, giving organizations the insight and confidence to adapt to changing local needs, while helping to drive overall organizational agility and engagement.\nWe also offer comprehensive, country-specific HCM solutions that combine innovative technology with deep local expertise. By operating a flexible service model, we help clients manage various combinations of payroll services, HR management, time and attendance management, talent management and benefits management, depending on the country in which the solution is provided.\nWe pay over 16 million workers outside the United States with our in-country and multi-country solutions, such as ADP iHCM and ADP Global Payroll. As part of our global payroll services, we supply year-end regulatory and legislative tax statements and other forms to our clients’ employees. Our global talent management solutions elevate the employee experience, from recruitment to ongoing employee engagement and development. Our comprehensive HR solutions combined with our deep expertise make our clients’ global HR management strategies a reality. Our configurable, automated time and attendance tools help global clients understand the work being performed and the resources being used, and help ensure the right people are in the right place at the right time.\nMARKETS AND SALES\nOur HCM solutions are offered in over 140 countries and territories across North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa. The most material markets for HCM Solutions, Global Solutions and HRO Solutions (other than PEO) are the United States, Canada and Europe. In each market, we have both country-specific solutions and multi-country solutions, for employers of all sizes and complexities. The major components of our offerings throughout these geographies are payroll, HR outsourcing and workforce management. In addition, we offer wage and tax collection and/or remittance services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, India, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Our PEO business offers services exclusively in the United States.\nWe market our solutions primarily through our direct sales force. We also market HCM Solutions, Global Solutions and HRO Solutions through indirect sales channels, such as marketing relationships with certified public accountants and banks, among others. None of our major business units has a single homogeneous client base or market. While concentrations of clients exist in specific industries, no one client, industry or industry group is material to our overall\nrevenues. We are a leader in each of our major service offerings and do not believe any of our major services or business units is subject to unique market risk.\nCOMPETITION\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive. We know of no reliable statistics by which we can determine the number of our competitors, but we believe that we are one of the largest providers of HCM solutions in the world. HCM Solutions, Global Solutions and HRO Solutions (other than PEO) compete with other business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services, providers of cloud-based HCM solutions and financial institutions. Our PEO business competes with other PEOs providing similar services, as well as business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services and providers of cloud-based HCM solutions. We also face ongoing competition from companies’ in-house functions, whereby companies install and operate their own HCM system.\nCompetition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on product and service quality, reputation, ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of offerings, and price. We believe that we are competitive in each of these areas and that our leading-edge technology (together with our data) and commitment to service excellence, distinguishes us from our competitors.\nINDUSTRY REGULATION\nOur business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them. We have, and continue to enhance, compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our operations and client solutions, including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs.\nAs a global leader in HR and payroll solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees. We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy, data protection, AI and cybersecurity-related laws, including federal, state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both client employee data and our own employee data. The changing nature of these comprehensive laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the European Union’s (the “EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”), and the Department of Justice’s (the “DOJ”) Data Security Program established under Executive Order 14117, impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. The GDPR imposes strict and comprehensive requirements on us as both a data controller and a data processor. As part of our overall data protection compliance program, including with respect to data protection laws in the EU, we are one of the few companies in the world to have implemented Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”). Compliance with our BCRs permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in accordance with the GDPR and other data protection laws in the EU. The\n\nCORPORATE BACKGROUND\nIn 1949, our founders established ADP with a simple, innovative idea: help clients focus on their business by solving their payroll challenges. In the more than 75 years since, we have shaped the world of work with innovation and expertise, transforming Human Capital Management (“HCM”) from an administrative challenge to a strategic business advantage. We continuously aim to solve complex business challenges for our clients and their workers, helping them work smarter today so they can have more success tomorrow.\nA\nD\nP\neople means ADP focuses on people, leveraging our unparalleled data insights and innovative technology to elevate human potential. Today, we are a global leader in HR and payroll solutions, serving over 1.1 million clients and paying over 42 million workers in over 140 countries and territories. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market® under the symbol “ADP.”\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nOur mission is to help businesses make meaningful change in the world of work by providing insightful HCM solutions that meet the evolving needs of our clients and their workers.\nAs new technologies and shifting workplace dynamics continuously reshape the way people work, we support every HCM need of our clients whether that client is a small, local business or a large, global enterprise operating around the world. From HR, payroll, time and benefits to HR outsourcing, talent, compliance and retirement, our solutions span the entire employee experience from hire to retire. Our leading technology and commitment to service excellence are at the core of our relationship with each one of our clients, which span over 140 countries and territories. We are always designing better ways to work through industry leading products, premium services and exceptional experiences that enable people to reach their full potential all around the world.\nWith a large and growing addressable market, we are focused on our core growth areas and further enhancing our market position by executing on our three strategic priorities:\n• Lead with Best-in-Class HCM Technology.\nWe design and develop world-class HCM platforms that simplify work and utilize enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence (“AI”) and modern cloud architecture. We aim to solve the needs of our clients and their workers today by making HCM transactions compliant and effortless, while anticipating their needs of tomorrow by incorporating valuable data insights and guidance into our solutions to help them better understand their workforce and position them to make better decisions.\n• Provide Unmatched Expertise and Outsourcing Solutions.\nOur clients look to us as a source of expertise to understand key HR trends and best practices, employment and related legislation and regulations, and to offer thoughtful strategies to utilize HCM technology to achieve their business objectives and support their workforce. Many of our clients also ask us to take on responsibility for a portion or all of their HCM workflows via one of our Human Resources Outsourcing (“HRO”) solutions. We continue to build on our deep expertise and make it readily available to our clients through a variety of channels, ranging from traditional call and chat options to self-guided and AI-powered options. We will continue to leverage our significant data insights and investments in AI and other technologies to further enable and effectively apply our decades of knowledge and experience to help our clients and their workers navigate the ever-changing world of work.\n• Benefit our Clients with Our Global Scale.\nOur clients benefit from our unmatched global footprint and scale in the HCM industry. We will continue to build on these strengths to further improve our client experience, and to add to our global footprint to further meet our clients where they choose to do business and address their needs for a distributed and flexible workforce. We see meaningful opportunities to leverage our strength in global payroll and expand our HR and workforce management\nsolutions to support our global and multinational clients. We continue to build more relationships with partners, such as through the ADP Marketplace, in order to provide clients with seamless integrations and customizations that simplify their HR processes and best address their unique needs. And we intend to grow our sales organization and continue to invest in best-in-class sales technology to not only optimize the purchase experience but to also empower our sellers to provide the deep expertise and insights our clients require to ensure they have the right HCM solutions to help them achieve their objectives and make a meaningful impact for their employees.\nInnovation is in our DNA. For over 75 years, we have proven that actively listening and responding to what clients and their employees need and want keeps the world of work progressing forward. As a founder in the industry, we pioneered HCM automation, HCM in the cloud, mobile HCM and a digital HCM marketplace, laying the groundwork and streamlining our infrastructure to innovate at a faster pace. This spirit of innovation remains a steady guide as we continue to listen and respond to emerging needs. As technologies like AI, machine learning (“ML”) and gener",

PEO Services has secured a workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance policy that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence and has also secured aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in fiscal years 2012 and prior from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the PEO segment.\nAdditionally, starting in fiscal year 2013, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), to cover substantially all losses incurred by the Company up to the\n$1 million per occurrence related to the workers\ncompensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees.\nEach of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote.\nADP Indemnity paid a premium of $276 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2025 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence. ADP Indemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $10 million in fiscal 2025 and a pre-tax benefit of approximately $3 million in fiscal 2024, which were primarily the results of more favorable actuarial loss development in workers’ compensation reserves. ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $278 million in July 2025, to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for fiscal 2026 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2025 reinsurance policy.\nThe primary components of “Other” are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and all other interest income and expense.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:\nAdjusted Financial Measures\nAdjusted provision for income taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nAdjusted net earnings\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\nDiluted earnings per share\nAdjusted effective tax rate\nOrganic constant currency\nWe believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior periods, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance. The nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations. Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.\nProvision for income taxes\nAll other interest expense (a)\nAll other interest income (a)\nGain on sale of assets\nTransformation initiatives (b)\nLegal settlements (c)\nOptimization initiatives (d)\nAdjusted EBIT Margin\nProvision for income taxes\nGain on sale of assets (e)\nTransformation initiatives (e)\nLegal settlements (e)\nOptimization initiatives (e)\nAdjusted provision for income taxes\nAdjusted effective tax rate (f)\nGain on sale of assets\nIncome tax provision on gain on sale of assets (e)\nTransformation initiatives (b)\nIncome tax benefit for transformation initiatives (e)\nLegal settlements (c)\nIncome tax provision for legal settlements (e)\nOptimization initiatives (d)\nIncome tax benefit for optimization initiatives (e)\nAdjusted net earnings\nTransformation initiatives (b) (e)\nLegal settlements (c) (e)\nOptimization initiatives (d) (e)\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n(a) In adjusted EBIT, we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as “All other interest expense” and “All other interest income.”\n(b) The charges in fiscal 2024 include consulting costs relating to our company-wide transformation initiatives.\n(c) In fiscal 2024, this represents reserve reversal of a legal matter from fiscal 2023.\n(d) In fiscal 2025, there were $23.9 million of severance charges related to broad-based, company-wide initiatives, including efforts to align resources with respect to our new global HCM products, offset by a $4.6 million partial reversal of the workforce optimization initiative from fiscal 2024. Severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results. Unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to broad-based, company-wide initiatives.\n(e) The income tax (benefit)/provision was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect for the year ended June 30, 2025.\n(f) The adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by the sum of our adjusted net earnings plus our adjusted provision for income taxes.\nThe following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic constant currency, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction. The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year results using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency.\nConsolidated revenue growth as reported\nImpact of acquisitions\nImpact of foreign currency\nConsolidated revenue growth, organic constant currency\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document and other written or oral statements made from time to time by Automatic Data Processing, Inc., its subsidiaries and variable interest entity (“ADP” or the “Company”) may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are not historical in nature and which may be identified by the use of words like “outlook,” “expects,” “assumes,” “projects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “we believe,” “could,” “is designed to” and other words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management’s expectations and assumptions and depend upon or refer to future events or conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements or that could contribute to such difference include: ADP's success in obtaining and retaining clients, and selling additional services to clients; the pricing of products and services; the success of our new solutions; our ability to respond successfully to changes in technology, including artificial intelligence; compliance with existing or new legislation or regulations; changes in, or interpretations of, existing legislation or regulations; overall market, political and economic conditions, including interest rate and foreign currency trends and inflation; competitive conditions; our ability to maintain our current credit ratings and the impact on our funding costs and profitability; security or cyber breaches, fraudulent acts, and system interruptions and failures; employment and wage levels; availability of\nskilled associates; the impact of new acquisitions and divestitures; the impact of any uncertainties related to major natural disasters or catastrophic events; and supply-chain disruptions. ADP disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. These risks and uncertainties, along with the risk factors discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, and in other written or oral statements made from time to time by ADP, should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements contained herein.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we use adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate and organic constant currency are all non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for a discussion of why ADP believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nAs a global leader in HR and payroll solutions, ADP continuously aims to solve complex business challenges for our clients and their workers. Our Human Capital Management (\"HCM\") solutions, which include both software and outsourcing services, are designed to help our clients manage their workforce through a dynamic business and regulatory landscape and the changing world of work. We see tremendous opportunity ahead as we focus on our three key Strategic Priorities: Leading with Best-in-Class HCM technology, Providing Unmatched Expertise and Outsourcing Solutions, and Leveraging our Global Scale for the Benefit of our Clients.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we continued to make meaningful progress on our Strategic Priorities. We launched ADP Lyric HCM, an all-in-one solution designed to address workplace challenges with personalized experiences that meet client needs. We acquired WorkForce Software, a premier workforce management solutions provider, and began to integrate it into our global HCM ecosystem to better serve large, global enterprises. We enhanced our distribution network by launching an integrated payroll solution for small businesses. We augmented our global payroll capabilities by continuing to expand our offerings in markets with exciting growth opportunities like Japan and Saudi Arabia, and by acquiring payroll businesses like PEI (Procesamiento Externo de Informacion, S.C.) in Mexico. Lastly, we continued deploying AI tools in our products and across our sales, service, and research and development functions to improve the client experience and drive internal productivity gains.\nHighlights from the year ended June 30, 2025 include:\nRevenue growth of 7% to $20,560.9 million; 7% growth on an organic constant currency\nEarnings before income taxes margin expansion of 50 bps, and adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 bps\nDiluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") growth of 10% and 9%, respectively, to $9.98 and $10.01, respectively\nCash returned via shareholder friendly actions of $3.7B, including $2.4B of dividends and $1.3B of share repurchases\nFor fiscal 2025, we delivered strong revenue growth of 7% both on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses, grew 1% for the year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. PEO average worksite employees increased 3% for the year ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. Additionally, our ES new business bookings grew 3% in fiscal 2025, and ES client revenue retention was 92.1%. Our strong retention stems in part from our company-wide client satisfaction scores reaching new record highs for the year. These impressive client satisfaction results were broad-based and are a testament to the product investments we are making to improve the client experience.\nWe have a strong business model, generating significant cash flows with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients’ HCM functions. We generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our long term strategy and commitments to shareholder friendly actions. We are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate.\nOur financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2025 and we remain well positioned to support our associates and our clients.\nRESULTS AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS\nFor the year ended June 30, respectively:\nYoY Growth, Organic Constant Currency\nRevenues increased in fiscal 2025 due to new business started from new business bookings, strong client retention, an increase in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, an increase in pricing, an increase in interest on funds held for clients, and the impact from the WorkForce Software acquisition. Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the changes in revenue for each of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services.\nTotal revenues for fiscal 2025 include interest on funds held for clients of $1,189.1 million, as compared ",
