During 2024, we generated $4.2 billion in cash from operations. We funded capital expenditures and investments of $1.9 billion, completed acquisitions for cash consideration of $625 million, purchased government obligations of $1.1 billion that were ultimately used to extinguish debt, and received proceeds from asset dispositions of $1.1 billion. Additionally, we received proceeds from debt issuances, net of debt repayments, of $2.1 billion. We paid $3.5 billion to repurchase common stock and $1.9 billion to fund dividends on our common stock. During 2024, cash and cash equivalents decreased $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. At this time, we believe that our cash on hand, as well as the sources of liquidity described herein, will be sufficient to fund our obligations over the short- and long-term.\nSignificant Sources of Capital\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2024, cash generated by operating activities was $4.2 billion, a $2.8 billion decrease compared with 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings, driven by a decline in realized refining margins, partially offset by more favorable working capital impacts.\nDuring 2023, cash generated by operating activities was $7.0 billion, a $3.8 billion decrease compared with 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized refining margins, working capital impacts, reduced operating distributions from equity affiliates, completion of long-term crude oil exchanges and higher contributions to our pension plans.\nOur short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.\nThe level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows. Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability, and weather conditions can affect output. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by fluctuations in margins and prices. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 95%, 92% and 90% in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our worldwide refining clean product yield was 87%, 85% and 84% in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nEquity Affiliate Operating Distributions\nOur operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates. Over the three years ended December 31, 2024, operating cash flows included aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of $4.2 billion. We cannot control the amount of future dividends from equity affiliates; therefore, future dividend payments by these equity affiliates are not assured.\nOn September 9, 2024, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, issued $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66. The senior unsecured notes issuance consisted of:\n$600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250% Senior Notes due 2031 (Additional 2031 Notes).\n$600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% Senior Notes due 2035 (2035 Notes).\n$600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2055 (2055 Notes).\nInterest on the Additional 2031 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year and commenced on December 15, 2024. Interest on the 2035 Notes and 2055 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, commencing on March 15, 2025.\nOn February 28, 2024, Phillips 66 Company issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66. The senior unsecured notes issuance consisted of:\n$600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250% Senior Notes due 2031 (2031 Notes).\n$400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.300% Senior Notes due 2033 (Additional 2033 Notes).\n$500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.650% Senior Notes due 2054 (2054 Notes).\nInterest on the 2031 Notes and 2054 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year and commenced on June 15, 2024. Interest on the Additional 2033 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 30 of each year and commenced on June 30, 2024.\nOn March 29, 2023, Phillips 66 Company issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66. The senior unsecured notes issuance consisted of:\n$750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% Senior Notes due December 2027.\n$500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.300% Senior Notes due June 2033.\nDischarge of Senior Notes\nOn September 20, 2024, we extinguished (i) the remaining $441 million outstanding principal amount of Phillips 66 Company’s 3.605% senior notes due February 2025 (2025 P66 Co Notes), and (ii) the remaining $650 million outstanding principal amount of Phillips 66’s 3.850% senior notes due April 2025 (the 2025 PSX Notes, and together with the 2025 P66 Co Notes, the Discharged Notes), whereby we irrevocably transferred a total of $1,100 million in government obligations to the trustee of the 2025 P66 Co Notes and the 2025 PSX Notes. The cash paid to purchase the government obligations is included within investing cash flows on our consolidated statement of cash flows. These government obligations will yield sufficient principal and interest over their remaining term to permit the trustee to satisfy the remaining principal and interest due on the Discharged Notes. Phillips 66 and Phillips 66 Company are no longer the primary obligors under the Discharged Notes. The transfer of the government obligations to the trustee was accounted for as a transfer of financial assets. If the trustee is unable to apply the government obligations to fund the remaining principal and interest payments on the Discharged Notes, then the Company’s obligations under the Indenture with respect to the Discharged Notes will be revived and reinstated. We deem the likelihood of such event to be remote with no impact to the legal isolation of the assets. Accordingly, the senior notes and the government obligations were derecognized on our balance sheet at December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an immaterial gain on the extinguishment of this debt.\nOn March 27, 2023, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, entered into a $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan agreement guaranteed by Phillips 66 (the Term Loan Agreement). The Term Loan Agreement provides for a single borrowing during a 90-day period commencing on the closing date, which borrowing was contingent upon the completion of the DCP LP Merger. The Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants similar to those contained in our revolving credit agreement, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The Term Loan Agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts after grace periods; and violation of covenants. We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at either: (a) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate plus the applicable margin, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $550 million and $1.25 billion were borrowed under the Term Loan Agreement, which matures in June 2026, respectively.\nRelated Party Advance Term Loan Agreements\nAt December 31, 2023, borrowings outstanding under our Advance Term Loan agreements with WRB totaled $290 million. Borrowings under these agreements were due between 2035 and 2038 and bore interest at a floating rate based on an adjusted term SOFR plus an applicable margin, payable on the last day of each month. On December 31, 2024, WRB distributed its Advance Term Loan with a principal balance of $290 million, including the right to receive any accrued but unpaid interest, to Phillips 66 Company, resulting in the reduction of our related party debt balance and our investment in WRB by $290 million. The distribution was recognized as a non-cash investing and financing transaction.\nAccounts Receivable Securitization\nOn September 30, 2024, Phillips 66 Company entered into a 364-day, $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility (the Receivables Securitization Facility). Under the Receivables Securitization Facility, Phillips 66 Company sells or contributes on an ongoing basis, certain of its receivables, together with related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, to its wholly owned subsidiary, Phillips 66 Receivables LLC (P66 Receivables), a consolidated and bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity created for the sole purpose of transacting under the Receivables Securitization Facility. Under the Receivables Securitization Facility, P66 Receivables may borrow and incur indebtedness from, and/or sell certain receivables in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate, and will secure its obligations with a pledge of undivided interests in such receivables, together with related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, to PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the secured parties thereunder. Accounts outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Facility accrue interest at an adjusted SOFR plus the applicable margin. In all instances, Phillips 66 Company retains the servicing of the accounts receivables transferred.\nP66 Receivables’ sole activity consists of purchasing receivables from Phillips 66 Company, providing those receivables as collateral for P66 Receivables’ borrowings or on-selling certain of its receivables under the Receivables Securitization Facility. P66 Receivables is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors, who will be entitled, upon its liquidation, to be satisfied out of P66 Receivables’ assets prior to assets or value in P66 Receivables becoming available to P66 Receivables’ equity holders. The assets of P66 Receivables, including any funds of P66 Receivables that may be commingled with funds of any of its affiliates for purposes of cash management and related efficiencies, are not available to pay creditors of Phillips 66 Company, Phillips 66 or any affiliate thereof. Collections on receivables in excess of amounts owed by P66 Receivables under the Receivables Securitization Facility are available to P66 Receivables for payment to Phillips 66 Company, for sales of its receivables to P66 Receivables under the Receivables Securitization Facility, and otherwise for distribution to Phillips 66 Company, in each case, subject to the terms set forth in the Receivables Securitization Facility. The amount available for borrowing or sale of receivables may be limited by the availability of eligible receivables and other customary factors and conditions, as well as the covenants set forth in the Receivables Securitization Facility.\nSales of accounts receivables under the Receivables Securitization Facility meet the sale criteria under ASC 860,\nTransfers and Servicing,\nand are derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet. P66 Receivables guarantees payment, in full, for accounts receivables sold to the purchasers. Cash receipts from the sale of accounts receivables under the Receivables Securitization Facility, received at the time of sale, are classified as cash flows from operating activities. For the year-ended December 31, 2024, we sold $125 million of accounts receivables in exchange for a $125 million reduction in our borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility, which was recognized as a non-cash financing transaction. We recognized an immaterial charge associated with the transfer of financial assets, which is included as a component within the line item “Selling, general and administrative expense” on our consolidated statement of income during the year ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, $121 million of the sold accounts receivable remained outstanding, which represents our maximum potential future exposure under the guarantee.\nBorrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility are recognized as short-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. Borrowings are secured by the accounts receivables, held by P66 Receivables, which remain reported as accounts receivables on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of $375 million under the Receivables Securitization Facility, secured by approximately $4.6 billion of accounts receivable held by P66 Receivables.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no unused capacity under the Receivables Securitization Facility.\nCredit Facilities and Commercial Paper\nPhillips 66 and Phillips 66 Company\nOn January 13, 2025, we entered into a $200 million uncommitted credit facility (the 2025 Uncommitted Facility) with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor. The 2025 Uncommitted Facility contains covenants and events of default customary for unsecured uncommitted facilities. The 2025 Uncommitted Facility has no commitment fees or compensating balance requirements. Outstanding borrowings under the 2025 Uncommitted Facility bear interest at a rate of either (a) the adjusted term SOFR plus the applicable margin, (b) the adjusted daily simple SOFR plus the applicable margin or (c) the base rate, in each case plus the applicable margin. Each borrowing matures six months from the date of such borrowing. We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. At February 21, 2025, no amount had been drawn under the 2025 Uncommitted Facility.\nOn June 25, 2024, we entered into a $400 million uncommitted credit facility (the 2024 Uncommitted Facility) with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor. The 2024 Uncommitted Facility contains covenants and events of default customary for unsecured uncommitted facilities. The 2024 Uncommitted Facility has no commitment fees or compensating balance requirements. Outstanding borrowings under the 2024 Uncommitted Facility bear interest at a rate of either (a) the adjusted term SOFR, (b) the adjusted daily simple SOFR or (c) the reference rate, in each case plus the applicable margin. Each borrowing matures six months from the date of such borrowing. We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. At December 31, 2024, the entire $400 million had been drawn under the 2024 Uncommitted Facility.\nOn February 28, 2024, we entered into a new $5 billion revolving credit agreement (the Facility) with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor and a scheduled maturity date of February 28, 2029. The Facility replaced our previous $5 billion revolving credit facility dated as of June 23, 2022, with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor, and the previous revolving credit facility was terminated. The Facility contains customary covenants similar to the previous revolving credit facility, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization rati",
