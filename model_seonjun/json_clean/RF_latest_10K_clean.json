  "item1_clean": "Regulation of Broker Dealers and Investment Advisers\nOur subsidiaries, Regions Securities and BlackArch Securities LLC, are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and FINRA, and Regions Investment Management, Inc. and Highland Associates, Inc. are registered investment advisers with the SEC. These subsidiaries are, as a result, subject to regulation and examination by the SEC, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations. These regulations cover a broad range of issues, including capital requirements; sales and trading practices; use of client funds and securities; the conduct of directors, officers and employees; record-keeping and recording; supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material non-public information; qualification and licensing of sales personnel; and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions. In addition to federal registration, state securities commissions require the registration of certain broker-dealers and investment advisers.\nAll aspects of our business are highly competitive. Our subsidiaries compete with other financial institutions located in the states in which they operate and other adjoining states, as well as large banks in major financial centers and other financial intermediaries, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, fintechs, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, mortgage companies and financial service operations of major commercial and retail corporations. We expect competition to remain intense among financial services companies. Our success will depend, in part, on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services. Further, despite delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, we expect consolidation in the financial services industry to continue, which may produce larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices.\nIn addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer traditional bank or bank-like products and services and therefore compete with financial institutions like us in providing electronic, internet-based and mobile phone-based financial solutions. In particular, the activity of fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. A number of fintechs have applied for, and in some cases been granted, bank or industrial loan charters, while other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers. In addition to fintechs, traditional technology companies have begun to make efforts toward providing financial services directly to their customers. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Regions provides an array of digital products and services to our customers and we expect a bank’s digital offerings to be a key competitive differentiator. The continued move toward digital banking and financial services, combined with customer expectations regarding digital offerings, will require us to invest greater resources in technological improvements. Customers for banking services and other financial services offered by our subsidiaries are generally influenced by convenience, quality of service, price of service, personal contacts, the quality of the technology that supports the customer experience and availability of products. Although our position varies in different markets, we believe that our affiliates effectively compete with other financial services companies in their relevant market areas.\nOne pillar of our strategic priorities at Regions is the commitment to “Build the Best Team”. We believe one of the biggest differentiators of our performance is the people we employ. The need to attract, retain and develop the right talent to accomplish our strategic plan is central to our success. As of December 31, 2024, Regions and its subsidiaries had 19,644 full-time equivalent employees supporting our consumer and commercial banking, wealth management and mortgage product and services primarily across the Southeast and Midwest.\nA strong and impactful human capital program begins at the top. Our Board oversees our corporate strategy and sets the tone for our culture, values and high ethical standards, and through its Committees, holds management accountable. The primary committee responsible for the oversight of human capital is the CHR Committee. The CHR Committee strategically meets with subject matter experts regarding talent management and acquisition, succession planning, associate conduct, associate learning and development, inclusive practices, and associate retention. Additionally, on a quarterly basis the CHR Committee reviews the HCM Dashboard which includes a mixture of trending and point-in-time metrics designed to provide information and analysis of workforce demographics; talent acquisition; workforce stability (retention, turnover, etc.); and associate conduct and engagement.\nIn order to build the best team, it is necessary for us to fill talent needs with qualified and engaged associates. Key to our success is our internal talent management program which strives to optimally deploy existing talent across Regions by focusing on where our associates excel and helping them find the best roles that maximize their talents, abilities and interests. For those roles which we fill externally, we continually build talent pipelines with an eye toward not only current needs, but also future demands of our business. Regions uses innovative tools and structured processes to achieve our goals including applications and resources designed to reach broader audiences. Our recruiting technology is agile, user friendly and allows us to offer to candidates a robust understanding of our needs, requirements and a view of our culture to support the building of an inclusive and engaged workforce.\n\nDIF. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity, as defined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly.\nThe FDIC, as required under the FDIA, established a plan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent within eight years. This plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate. Based on the FDIC’s recent projections, however, the FDIC determined that the DIF reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028 without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates.\nDuring 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. This rule, combined with other factors influenced by Regions’ financial performance, increased regulatory premiums in 2023. The FDIC also concurrently maintained the Designated Reserve Ratio for the DIF at 2 percent.\nFDIC Recordkeeping Requirements\nAs a part of the FDIC Part 370 recordkeeping requirements, Regions is subject to facilitate rapid and accurate payment of FDIC-insured deposits to customers when large IDIs fail. FDIC rules require IDIs with two million or more deposit accounts to maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor's ownership interest by right and capacity and to develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner by ownership right and capacity.\nThe BHC Act requires every BHC to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: (i) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after such acquisition, the BHC will directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of the voting shares of the institution; (ii) it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association; or (iii) it may merge or consolidate with any other BHC. FHCs must obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve before acquiring certain non-bank financial companies with assets exceeding $10 billion. FHCs seeking approval to complete an acquisition must be well-capitalized and well-managed.\nThe BHC Act further provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the U.S., or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the BHCs and banks impacted and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, and the consideration of convenience and needs of the community to be served includes the parties’ performance under the CRA. The Federal Reserve must also take into account the institutions’ effectiveness in combating money laundering. In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the BHC Act was amended to require the Federal Reserve to, when evaluating a proposed transaction, consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system.\nLate in the preceding administration, the standards by which bank and financial institution acquisitions would be evaluated have been undergoing review and change by the OCC, FDIC and DOJ, but not by the Federal Reserve. These reviews and changes were incorporated into non-binding guidance. The DOJ withdrew its 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines and issued the 2024 Banking Addendum to its 2023 Merger Guidelines. The DOJ clarified that it will assess competition considerations in connection with bank and BHC mergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines, which is the general merger review framework the DOJ now uses to evaluate transactions in all segments of the economy, and the 2024 Banking Addendum. The 2024 Banking Addendum provides guidance on how the DOJ will assess competition in the context of bank and bank holding company mergers. An analysis under the 2023 Merger Guidelines and 2024 Banking Addendum may include consideration of theories of harm and relevant markets not considered under the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, which focused primarily on concentrations of deposits and branches. Whether and how the guidance might be further changed or interpreted by the new administration is uncertain.\n\nOther Financial Services Operations\nIn addition to its banking operations, Regions and its subsidiaries deliver specialty capabilities including merger and acquisition advisory services, capital markets solutions, home improvement lending, investment advisory services, equipment financing for commercial clients and small business customers, low income housing tax credit corporate fund syndication and asset management, financing to CRA-qualified customers, investment and insurance products, broker-dealer services to commercial clients, and others.\nSupervision and Regulation\nWe are subject to the extensive regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to BHCs and their subsidiaries.

  "item7_clean": "Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.8 billion or $1.93 per diluted share in 2024 compared to net income available to common shareholders of $2.0 billion or $2.11 per diluted share in 2023.\nNet interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $4.9 billion in 2024 compared to $5.4 billion in 2023. The net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.54 percent in 2024, reflecting a 36 basis point decrease from 2023. The decreases in net interest income and net interest margin were primarily driven by higher funding costs, which included an increase in deposit costs due to continued re-mixing. Partially offsetting the increase in funding costs was higher asset yields benefiting from the maturity and continued replacement of lower-yielding, fixed-rate loans and securities. See Table 2 \"Volume and Yield/Rate Variances\" for further details.\nThe provision for credit losses totaled $487 million in 2024 compared to $553 million in 2023. The provision for credit losses was higher than net charge-offs by $29 million in 2024. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was driven primarily by asset quality normalization. Refer to the \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for further detail.\nNon-interest income improved slightly, totaling $2.3 billion in both 2024 and 2023. The improvement was driven by increases in most categories, led by capital markets income. These increases were largely offset by net securities losses and decreased card and ATM fees. See Table 3 \"Non-Interest Income\" for further details.\nNon-interest expense was $4.2 billion in 2024 and $4.4 billion in 2023. The decrease was driven by declines in operational losses, FDIC insurance assessments primarily related to the special assessment initially recognized in 2023, and miscellaneous expenses. The declines were partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits. See Table 4 \"Non-Interest Expense\" for further details.\nRegions' effective tax rate was 19.6 percent in 2024 compared to 20.5 percent in 2023. See the \"Income Taxes\" section for further details.\n\"Operating Results\" section of MD&A\n“Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin” discussion within the “Operating Results” section of MD&A\n“Interest Rate Risk” discussion within the “Risk Management” section of MD&A\nRegions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve and its SCB is currently floored at 2.5 percent. See Note 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding CCAR results.\nOn April 20, 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Regions repurchased approximately 34 million shares of common stock under this program, which reduced shareholders' equity by $614 million. On December 10, 2024, the Board authorized an extension of the common stock repurchase program through the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\"Shareholders' Equity\" discussion in MD&A\n\"Regulatory Requirements\" section of MD&A\nNote 14 \"Shareholders' Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\" to the consolidated financial statements\nRegions and Regions Bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by Federal and State banking agencies. Under the Basel III Rules, Regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. The Basel III Rules maintain the minimum guidelines for Regions to be considered well-capitalized for Tier 1 capital and Total capital at 6.0% and 10.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2024, Regions’ Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios were estimated to be 12.17% and 14.06%, respectively.\nThe Basel III Rules also officially defined CET1. Regions' CET1 ratio at December 31, 2024 was estimated to be 10.80%.\n“Supervision and Regulation” discussion within Item 1. Business\n\ntrust activities, capital markets and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, equipment and software expenses, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, FDIC insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.\nEconomic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions’ market areas.\nRegions’ business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile banking.\nRegions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, and other specialty financing. Regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank, and Wealth Management, with the remainder in Other.\nSee Note 22 \"Business Segment Information\" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on Regions’ business segments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND RELATED POLICIES\nIn preparing financial information, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with GAAP, regulatory guidance, where applicable, and general banking practices. Estimates and assumptions most significant to Regions are related primarily to the allowance, fair value measurements, intangible assets (goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets), MSRs measured at fair value, and income taxes, and are summarized in the following discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. Regions determines its allowance in accordance with GAAP and applicable regulatory guidance.\nSee Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 5 \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" to the consolidated financial statements for information about areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the allowance.\nThe allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as changes in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. The allowance is also sensitive to external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by changes in interest rates, inflation, GDP, unemployment rates, changes in real estate demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes.\nManagement considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance. These variables and others have the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts.\nChanges in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates. Volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected. Additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits, commodity prices, or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility. The scenarios discussed below, or other scenarios, have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ, perhaps materially, from the originally estimated amounts. This analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on then-current circumstances and conditions.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in the allowance estimate. Changes in the factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be\n\nSee Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 19 \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements for further details and discussion.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN\nNet interest income is Regions’ principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of Regions’ ability to meet its overall performance goals. Both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by both long-term and short-term market interest rates. Long-term and short-term rates were higher for most of 2024 compared to 2023. Late in the third quarter of 2024, the FOMC decreased the Fed funds rate by approximately 50 basis points and by an additional 25 basis points at the November and December meetings, for a total of 100 basis points. See the \"Executive Overview\" for a discussion of recent FOMC activity.\nNet interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) decreased by $503 million in 2024 compared to 2023, and net interest margin decreased by 36 basis points to 3.54 percent in 2024. This represents a normalization from elevated post-pandemic levels. The decreases in net interest income and net interest margin were driven primarily by higher funding costs in a prolonged high rate environment. In 2024, funding costs, which includes deposits and wholesale borrowings utilized during the year, increased to 1.73 percent compared to 1.19 percent in 2023. The increase in funding costs was driven by higher deposit costs due to continued deposit remixing as depositors moved into higher interest earning products, albeit at a slower pace than the remixing experienced in 2023. Deposit costs increased to 1.56 percent for 2024 compared to 0.99 percent for 2023.\nPartially offsetting the increase in funding costs were higher asset yields benefiting from the maturity and continued replacement of lower-yielding, fixed-rate loans and securities. The Company's loan yields are primarily influenced by short-term interest rates such as 30-day term SOFR, which averaged 5.19 percent in 2024 compared to 4.98 percent in 2023. Additionally, fixed-rate lending production, which contains significant residential mortgage fixed-rate exposure, benefited from higher middle and long-term rates. The Company also continued its reinvestment strategy in the securities portfolio and executed multiple, distinct debt securities repositioning transactions. As a result, the debt securities yield increased to 2.89 percent in 2024 from 2.38 percent in 2023. See Table 6 for more information.\nSee also the \"Market Risk-Interest Rate Risk\" section in Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.\n\nFDIC Insurance Assessments\nFDIC insurance assessments decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily resulting from the special assessment that was initially recorded in 2023.\nFederal law requires that any losses to the FDIC’s DIF related to the protection of uninsured depositors under the Systemic Risk Exception be repaid by a special assessment on IDIs. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the FDIC finalized a special assessment related to the two March 2023 bank failures, which was required to be recognized as the accrual of a liability and related expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $119 million. In late February 2024, the FDIC published revised loss estimates related to the failures, increasing the estimated loss to the DIF. Based on updated information provided by the FDIC, Regions increased the special assessment accrual during 2024 by $16 million. The total special assessment is to be paid in ten quarterly installments that began with the invoice for the first quarter of 2024 (received in June 2024) and are deductible for income taxes.\nIn addition to the reduction in accruals for the special assessment, favorability in the base assessment which was driven by higher levels of unsecured debt and cash as well as lower exposures in higher risk assets, further drove the year-over-year decrease in FDIC insurance assessments.\nOperational losses include losses related to fraud, execution, delivery and process management, and damage to physical assets. Operational losses decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to check fraud that occurred in the second and third quarters of 2023.\nOther Miscellaneous Expenses\nOther miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans. Other miscellaneous expenses decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to lower pension related costs and a reduction for a contingent reserve release in the second quarter of 2024 related to a prior acquisition.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company’s income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $461 million compared to $533 million in 2023, resulting in effective tax rates of 19.6% and 20.5%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2024 was primarily due to lower pre-tax income in 2024 as compared to 2023, causing tax preferential items to have a more favorable impact to the effective tax rate.\nThe effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance income, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. In addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to UTBs. Accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company reported a net deferred tax asset of $775 million compared to $741 million at December 31, 2023.\nSee Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 19 \"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nThe following sections provide expanded discussion of significant changes in certain line items in asset, liability, and shareholders' equity categories.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nCash and cash equivalents increased approximately $3.9 billion from $6.8 billion at December 31, 2023 to $10.7 billion at Dec",
