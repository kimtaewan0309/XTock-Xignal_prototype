The growth of 5.9% in organic revenues was broad-based across the segment, led by our businesses serving the acute healthcare, property and casualty insurance, and legal markets. Gross margin increased to 69.0% in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to 68.3% in the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to improved leverage on higher organic revenues, partially offset by a lower gross margin profile associated with the higher payments revenue mix at Transact. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues improved to 41.2% in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to 42.0% in the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to cost synergies resulting from the integration of Transact with CBORD and operating leverage on higher organic revenues, partially offset by higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisition of CentralReach.

SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 40.8% in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to 39.7% in the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to SG&A profiles associated with our third quarter 2025 acquisitions, Subsplash and Convoy, including higher amortization of acquired intangibles.

The dollar increase was due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expense.\nInterest expense, net, increased to $89.7 for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to $67.7 for the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to a higher weighted-average fixed-rate debt balance and interest rate.\nEquity investments activity, net, was a gain of $12.9 in the third quarter of 2025 due primarily to a $16.3 increase in the fair value of our equity investment in Indicor. Equity investments activity, net, was a gain of $37.4 in the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to an increase in the fair value of our equity investment in Indicor.
