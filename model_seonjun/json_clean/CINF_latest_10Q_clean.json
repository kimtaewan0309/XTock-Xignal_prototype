Any forward-looking statements contained herein, are based upon our current estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words like “seek,” “expect,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “likely,” “future,” or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made; we assume no obligation to update such statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:\nInsurance-Related Risks\nRisks and uncertainties associated with our loss reserves or actual claim costs exceeding reserves\nIncreased frequency and/or severity of claims or development of claims that are unforeseen at the time of policy issuance\nUnusually high levels of catastrophe losses due to risk concentrations or changes in weather patterns, environmental events, war or political unrest, terrorism incidents, cyberattacks, civil unrest or other causes; and our ability to manage catastrophe risk\nRisks associated with analytical models in key areas such as underwriting, pricing, capital management, reserving, investments, reinsurance, and catastrophe risk management\nInadequate estimates or assumptions, or reliance on third-party data used for critical accounting estimates\nEvents or conditions that could weaken or harm our relationships with our independent agencies and hamper opportunities to add new agencies, resulting in limitations on our opportunities for growth\nMergers, acquisitions, and other consolidations of agencies that result in a concentration of a significant amount of premium in one agency or agency group and/or alter our competitive advantages\nOur inability to manage business opportunities, growth prospects, and expenses for our ongoing operations\nChanging consumer insurance-buying habits\nThe inability to obtain adequate ceded reinsurance on acceptable terms, for acceptable amounts, and from financially strong reinsurers; and the potential for nonpayment or delay in payment by reinsurers\nCincinnati Financial Corporation Third-Quarter 2025 10-Q\nDomestic and global events, such as the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East, future pandemics, inflationary trends, changes in U.S. trade and tariff policy, and disruptions in the banking and financial services industry, resulting in insurance losses, capital market or credit market uncertainty, followed by prolonged periods of economic instability or recession, that lead to:\nSecurities market disruption or volatility and related effects such as decreased economic activity and continued supply chain disruptions that affect our investment portfolio and book value\nSignificant or prolonged decline in the fair value of securities and impairment of the assets\nSignificant decline in investment income due to reduced or eliminated dividend payouts from securities\nSignificant rise in losses from surety or director and officer policies written for financial institutions or other insured entities or in losses from policies written by Cincinnati Re or Cincinnati Global\nAn unusually high level of claims in our insurance or reinsurance operations that increase litigation-related expenses\nDecreased premium revenue and cash flow from disruption to our distribution channel of independent agents, consumer self-isolation, travel limitations, business restrictions and decreased economic activity\nThe inability of our workforce, agencies, or vendors to perform necessary business functions\nFinancial, Economic, and Investment Risks\n\nCincinnati Financial Corporation Third-Quarter 2025 10-Q\nWe continue to monitor new losses and case reserve increases greater than $2 million for trends in factors such as initial reserve levels, loss cost inflation and claim settlement expenses. Our analysis continues to indicate no unexpected concentration of these large losses and case reserve increases by risk category, geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. The third-quarter 2025 commercial lines total large losses incurred of $107 million, net of reinsurance, was higher than the quarterly average of $49 million during full-year 2024 and the $67 million of total large losses incurred for the third quarter of 2024. The increase in commercial lines large losses for the first nine months of 2025 was primarily due to our commercial property line of business. The third-quarter 2025 ratio for commercial lines total large losses was 2.8 percentage points higher than last year's third-quarter ratio. The third-quarter 2025 amount of total large losses incurred unfavorably contributed to the increase in the nine-month 2025 total large loss ratio, compared with 2024, in addition to a first-half 2025 ratio that was 0.5 points higher than the first half of 2024. We believe results for the three- and nine-month periods largely reflected normal fluctuations in loss patterns and normal variability in large case reserves for claims above $2 million.\nPERSONAL LINES INSURANCE RESULTS\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n\nWe continue to monitor new losses and case reserve increases greater than $2 million for trends in factors such as initial reserve levels, loss cost inflation and claim settlement expenses.

In the third quarter of 2025, the personal lines total large loss ratio, net of reinsurance, was 0.2 percentage points higher than last year's third quarter. The increase in personal lines total large losses incurred for the first nine months of 2025 occurred primarily for our homeowner line of business and inland marine coverages in our other personal line of business. The third-quarter 2025 amount of total large losses incurred unfavorably contributed to the increase in the nine-month 2025 total large loss ratio, compared with 2024, in addition to a first-half 2025 ratio that was 2.7 points higher than the first half of 2024. We believe results for the three- and nine-month periods largely reflected normal fluctuations in loss patterns and normal variability in large case reserves for claims above $2 million.\nEXCESS AND SURPLUS LINES INSURANCE RESULTS\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n\nWe continue to monitor new losses and case reserve increases greater than $2 million for trends in factors such as initial reserve levels, loss cost inflation and claim settlement expenses.

In the third quarter of 2025, the excess and surplus lines total ratio for large losses, net of reinsurance, was 1.3 percentage points lower than last year's third quarter. The third-quarter 2025 amount of total large losses incurred contributed favorably to the decrease in the nine-month 2025 total large loss ratio, compared with 2024, in addition to a first-half 2025 ratio that was 0.7 points lower than the first half of 2024. We believe results for the three- and nine month periods largely reflected normal fluctuations in loss patterns and normal variability in large case reserves for claims above $2 million.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation Third-Quarter 2025 10-Q\nLIFE INSURANCE RESULTS\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n\nIneffective information technology systems or failing to develop and implement improvements in technology\nDifficulties with technology or data security breaches, including cyberattacks, could negatively affect our, or our agents’, ability to conduct business; disrupt our relationships with agents, policyholders, and others; cause reputational damage, mitigation expenses, data loss, and expose us to liability\nDifficulties with our operations and technology that may negatively impact our ability to conduct business, including cloud-based data information storage, data security, remote working capabilities, and/or outsourcing relationships and third-party operations and data security\nDisruption of the insurance market caused by technology innovations - such as driverless cars - that could decrease consumer demand for insurance products\nDelays, inadequate data developed internally or from third parties, or performance inadequacies from ongoing development and implementation of underwriting and pricing models and methods, including usage-based insurance methods, automation, artificial intelligence, or technology projects and enhancements expected to increase our efficiency, pricing accuracy, underwriting profit, and competitiveness\nCincinnati Financial Corporation Third-Quarter 2025 10-Q\nIntense competition, and the impact of innovation, emerging technologies, artificial intelligence and changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which we operate, could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and profitability\nInability to defer policy acquisition costs for any business segment if pricing and loss trends would lead management to conclude that the segment could not achieve sustainable profitability\nUnforeseen departure of certain executive officers or other key employees that could interrupt progress toward important strateg"
