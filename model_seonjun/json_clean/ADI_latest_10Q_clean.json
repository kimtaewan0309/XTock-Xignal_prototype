The fiscal year ending November 1, 2025 (fiscal 2025) is a 52-week fiscal year and fiscal 2024 was a 53-week fiscal year. The additional week in fiscal 2024 was included in the first quarter ended February 3, 2024. Therefore, the first nine months of fiscal 2025 included one less week of operations as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2024.\nRevenue Trends by End Market\nThe following tables summarize revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.\n\nY/Y%\nY/Y%\n* The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\nRevenue increased 25% and 14% in the three- and nine-month periods ended August 2, 2025 as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year as a result of a broad-based increase in demand for our products.\nIn addition to increased demand, the increase in the nine-month period is due to customer inventory balances normalizing in the Industrial end market, the increases in the Automotive end market are primarily driven by increases from connectivity solutions, and the increases in the Communications end market are primarily driven by growth in the wireline sub-market from data center infrastructure build outs, primarily to support growth in artificial intelligence applications. The increases in the Consumer end market are primarily related to portable consumer products. These increases in the nine-month period were partially offset by the impact of an additional week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nRevenue by Sales Channel\nThe following tables summarize revenue by sales channel. We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. Distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them. Direct customers are non-distributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers. Other customers include the U.S. government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time.\n* The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\nAs indicated in the tables above, the percentage of total revenue sold via each channel has remained relatively consistent in the periods presented, but can fluctuate from time to time based on end market revenue trends. As a percentage of total revenue, the decrease in the distributor channel is primarily due to the decrease in the percentage of revenue from our Industrial end market.\n\nNet income as a % of revenue\nNet income increased in the three-month period ended August 2, 2025, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as the result of a $326.7 million increase in operating income and a $13.7 million decrease in nonoperating expense (income), partially offset by a $214.1 million increase in provision for income taxes.\nNet income increased in the nine-month period ended August 2, 2025, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as the result of a $523.9 million increase in operating income and a $40.0 million decrease in nonoperating expense (income), partially offset by a $241.5 million increase in provision for income taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt August 2, 2025, our principal source of liquidity was $3.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $2.3 billion was held in the United States, and the balance of which was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States. We do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including money market funds and corporate and bank obligations. We maintain these balances with counterparties with high credit ratings, and continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.\nWe believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operations as a % of revenue\nNet cash used for investing activities\nNet cash used for financing activities\nThe following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents in the nine-month period ended August 2, 2025 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2024.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the nine-month period ended August 2, 2025, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was mainly the result of higher net income adjusted for non-cash items.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting cash flows generally consist of purchases of property, plant and equipment, available-for-sale investments and acquisitions of other businesses. The change in investing cash flows during the nine-month period ended August 2, 2025, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of changes in our short-term investments and a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures as the rate of spending on our global resiliency and hybrid manufacturing footprint moderated. The change in investing cash flows also included net proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, partially offset by cash paid for an acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nFinancing Activities\n\nFinancing cash flows generally consist of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. The change in cash used for financing activities during the nine-month period ended August 2, 2025, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of higher common stock repurchases and higher dividend payments to shareholders.\nDays sales outstanding*\nDays cost of sales in inventory*\n_______________________________________\nWe use the average of the current quarter and prior quarter ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory, respectively.\nThe increase in accounts receivable in dollars was primarily the result of variations in the timing of collections and billings and increased revenue levels in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nInventory increased primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand.\nCurrent liabilities decreased to $2,979.0 million at August 2, 2025 as compared to $2,988.3 million at the end of fiscal 2024 primarily due to the repayment of approximately $400.0 million of debt during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 partially offset by higher accrued liabilities.\nAs of August 2, 2025, our debt obligations consisted of the following:\nPrincipal Amount Outstanding\nCommercial paper notes\n2026 Notes, due December 2026\n2027 Notes, due June 2027\n2028 Notes, due June 2028\n2028 Notes, due October 2028\n2030 Notes, due June 2030\n2031 Notes, due October 2031\n2032 Notes, due October 2032\n2034 Notes, due April 2034\n2036 Notes, due December 2036\n2041 Notes, due October 2041\n2045 Notes, due December 2045\n2051 Notes, due October 2051\n2054 Notes, due April 2054\nThe indentures governing our outstanding notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of August 2, 2025, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nCommercial Paper Program\n\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $3.0 billion (subject to certain terms and conditions). We may borrow under this revolving credit facility in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditur"
