Our global suite of multimodal logistics services brings together the expertise of our people with custom technology differentiated by one of the largest datasets on shipments, routings, and carriers in the world.\nThe Robinson Operating Model is the foundation of our strategy, execution, and accountability throughout the organization. Rooted in Lean principles, it has elevated our team and leaders to focus on accelerated opportunity identification and operational effectiveness in delivering value to our customers. Leveraging our rich datasets supported by the framework of the Robinson Operating Model, our culture has embraced a disciplined approach to continuous improvement and speed of decision making.\nAs one of the world’s largest logistics platforms, our proprietary technology connects\ncarriers. We work closely with a global network of transportation companies, including contracted motor carriers, railroads, and ocean and air carriers. We utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost-effectively arrange the transport of our customers’ freight. In 2024, our customers trusted us to manage approximately\nin freight. As an integral part of our transportation services, we also provide a wide range of value-added logistics services, such as freight consolidation, drop trailer, cross-border logistics, customs brokerage and trade compliance, supply chain consulting and design, and fully managed third-party logistics (“3PL”) and fourth-party logistics (“4PL”) solutions.\nO\nur global team of supply chain experts, differentiated technology, and integrated product portfolio across ocean, air, rail, and truck shipping bring unique value to the marketplace. Our global perspective across all links in the supply chain are critical in supporting shippers through market volatility and global supply chain disruptions. We are also a key driver of digital transformation in our industry. Our innovations with artificial intelligence (“\nAI\n”), machine learning, and data science benefit our customers and help power our growth strategy. We are expanding the use of generative AI in our industry, creating proprietary technology to perform work that defied automation for decades. Our customers get better service, faster speed-to-market and more cost savings, while our people are freed from repetitive, mundane tasks so they can focus on more strategic work. Our enhancements to our dynamic costing and pricing models are key contributors to expanding our operating margins and growing volume and market share.\nIn addition to transportation and logistics services, we also provide sourcing services under the trade name Robinson Fresh\n(“Robinson Fresh”). Our sourcing services consist primarily of the buying, selling, and/or marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other value-added perishable items. The foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to this original business, founded in 1905, which gives us significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities. We supply fresh produce through a network of independent produce growers and suppliers. Our customers include grocery retailers, restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers. In many cases, we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services, such as replenishment, category management, and managed procurement services. We have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh and value-added produce under recognized consumer brand names. The produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements. We have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers.\nSegment information.\nWe have two reportable segments, North American Surface Transportation (“NAST”) and Global Forwarding, with our remaining operating segments reported as All Other and Corporate. The All Other and Corporate segment includes Robinson Fresh, Managed Solutions, Other Surface Transportation outside of North America, and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. See additional disclosure in Note 8,\n, to our consolidated financial statements.\nNAST provides transportation and logistics services across North America through a network of offices in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The primary services provided by NAST include truckload and less than truckload (“LTL”) transportation brokerage services.\nGlobal Forwarding provides transportation and logistics services through an international network of offices in North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, South America, and the Middle East and also contracts with independent agents worldwide. The primary services provided by Global Forwarding include ocean freight services, air freight services, and customs brokerage.\nRobinson Fresh provides sourcing services that primarily include the buying, selling, and/or marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other value-added perishable items. Robinson Fresh sources products from around the world.\nIn November 2024, we launched C.H. Robinson Managed Solutions™ to address a growing gap in the marketplace for shippers wanting seamless access to 4PL services, 3PL, managed transportation and Transportation Management Services (“TMS”) technology from one provider. Consulting services, logistics optimization, and day-to-day logistics management services formerly offered through our TMC division are now offered through Managed Solutions.\nOther Surface Transportation revenues are primarily earned by our Europe Surface Transportation operating segment. Europe Surface Transportation provides transportation and logistics services, including truckload and LTL transportation services, across Europe. The sale of our Europe Surface Transportation business was announced in July 2024 and closed in February 2025.\nTransportation and Logistics Services\nC.H. Robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services. Our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships. We execute these services by investing in and retaining talented employees, developing innovative proprietary systems and processes, and utilizing a network of contracted transportation providers, including, but not limited to, contracted motor carriers, railroads, and ocean and air carriers. We make a profit that is driven by the value we provide our customers and the resulting difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to transport the freight.\nWe provide the following transportation and logistics services:\nTruckload: Through our contracts with motor carriers, we have access to dry vans, temperature controlled vans, flatbeds, and bulk capacity. Through the use of our proprietary Navisphere platform\n, we connect our customers with contracted motor carriers that specialize in their transportation lanes and product types, and we help contracted motor carriers optimize the usage of their equipment.\nLTL: LTL transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight. We primarily focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger, although we handle any size shipment. Through our contracts with motor carriers and the use of Navisphere, we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight. In many instances, we consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloads.\nOcean: As a licensed Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (“NVOCC”) and freight forwarder, we consolidate shipments, determine routing, select ocean carriers, contract for ocean shipments, and/or provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments.\nAir: As a certified Indirect Air Carrier (“IAC”) and freight forwarder, we organize air shipments and provide door-to-door service.\nCustoms: Our customs brokers are licensed and regulated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other authoritative governmental agencies to assist importers and exporters in meeting regulatory and operational requirements governing imports and exports.\nOther Logistics Services: We provide intermodal transportation service, which is the shipment of freight in containers or trailers by a combination of truck and rail. In addition, we provide fee-based Managed Solutions, warehousing services, and other services.\nCustomers communicate their freight needs, typically on an order-by-order basis, to the C.H. Robinson team responsible for their account, either directly or through highly automated connections established between Navisphere and the customers’ transportation management system. The C.H. Robinson team then ensures all necessary information regarding each shipment is available in Navisphere. We utilize the information from Navisphere and other available sources to select the best contracted carrier based on factors such as their service score, equipment availability, freight rates, and other relevant factors.\nOnce the contracted carrier is selected, we receive the contracted carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation. During the time when a shipment is executed, we connect frequently, either electronically or manually, with the contracted carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the unique needs of our customers.\nFor most of our transportation and logistics services, we are a service provider. By accepting the customer’s order, we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination. The carrier’s contract is with us, not the customer, and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges. In cases where we have agreed to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit, we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims. In our Managed Solutions business, we are often acting as the shipper’s agent. In those cases, the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer, and we collect a fee for our services.\nAs a result of our logistics capabilities, our technology, our global suite of services, and integrated modes of transportation, some of our customers have us handle all, or a substantial portion, of their freight transportation needs. Our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer. Our services to the customer may be priced on a spot market, or transactional basis, or prearranged contractual rates. Most of our contractual rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation. As is typical in the transportation industry, most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments. When we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers, we usually have fuel surcharge agreements that allow for fuel to primarily act as a pass-through cost, in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate.\nWe purchase most of our truckload services from our contracted truckload carriers on a spot market, or transactional basis, even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis. In some cases, we may get advance commitments from one or more contracted motor carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract or to provide transportation services within dense transportation lanes. In those cases, where we have prearranged rates",
  "item7_clean": "Adjusted gross profit margin percentage\nTotal adjusted gross profit margin\n________________________________\nAdjusted gross profit margin is a non-GAAP financial measure explained above.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources includes a comparison of the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, to the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. A similar discussion and analysis that compares the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, to the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, can be\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\nA reconciliation of our reportable segments to our consolidated results can be found in Note 8,\nConsolidated Results of Operations—Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\nTotal revenues and direct costs.\nTotal revenues and direct costs were essentially flat with the prior year with significant offsetting impacts from ocean and truckload services. Ocean transportation revenues and direct costs increased, driven by the volatile market conditions experienced in 2024, as discussed in the market trends section above, which significantly impacted carrier capacity and led to increased ocean freight rates. Conversely, truckload transportation revenues and direct costs decreased compared to the prior year. This decline in truckload pricing and purchased transportation costs was driven by the soft market conditions in surface transportation, characterized by an oversupply of carrier capacity throughout most of 2024. Our sourcing total revenue and direct costs increased, driven by higher average pricing with retail customers and increased case volume with foodservice customers.\nGross profits and adjusted gross profits.\nOur transportation adjusted gross profits increased due to higher adjusted gross profits per transaction in ocean and truckload services, in addition to increased volumes in our ocean service line. The higher adjusted gross profits per transaction in ocean services were driven by the challenges facing the global forwarding market, which resulted in elevated pricing. In truckload services, the increase was driven by the improved execution and disciplined pricing and capacity procurement efforts from our team within our transactional portfolio during 2024. Sourcing adjusted gross profits increased, driven by an increase in integrated supply chain solutions for retail and foodservice customers.\nPersonnel expenses decreased, primarily due to cost optimization efforts including lower average employee headcount partially offset by higher variable compensation reflecting the improved results compared to the prior year. Other SG&A expenses increased primarily due to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business, which was partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of our Argentina operations in 2023 discussed below.\nIn addition to the above, our personnel expenses for 2024 included $24.1 million of severance and related personnel expenses related to our 2024 Restructuring Program. We also incurred $66.2 million in other SG&A expenses in 2024. These expenses were primarily due to a $44.5 million loss related to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business and $21.9 million related to our 2024 Restructuring Program.\nOur personnel expenses for 2023 included $18.4 million of severance and related expenses related to our 2022 Restructuring Program. We also incurred $19.6 million of other SG&A expenses primarily related to the divestiture of our Argentina operations. Refer to Note 14,\n, for further discussion related to our 2024 and 2022 Restructuring Programs. Refer to Note 15,\n, for further discussion related to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business and Argentina operations.\nInterest and other income/expense, net.\nInterest and other income/expense, net was $89.9 million, primarily consisted of $85.9 million of interest expense, which decreased $4.3 million compared to the prior year due to a lower average debt balance. The current year also included a $7.4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses. The prior year included a $24.4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses driven by a $16.4 million foreign currency loss related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso.\nProvision for income taxes.\nOur effective income tax rate was 19.6 percent in 2024 and 20.5 percent in 2023. The effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of U.S. tax credits and incentives and share-based payment awards, which reduced the effective tax rate by 5.3 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points, respectively. These impacts were partially offset by foreign tax credits and state income taxes, net of federal benefit, which increased the effective tax rate by 2.5 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign tax credits, U.S. tax credits and incentives, and the tax impact of share-based payment awards, which reduced the effective tax rate by 9.5 percentage points, 3.4 percentage points, and 2.7 percentage points, respectively. These impacts were partially offset by a higher tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of a Section 199 domestic production activities settlement, which increased the effective tax rate by 5.8 percentage points and 4.7 percentage points, respectively.\nNAST Segment Results of Operations\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\nPurchased transportation and related services\nOther selling, general, and administrative expenses\nTotal costs and expenses\n\nService line volume statistics\nAdjusted gross profits\nTotal adjusted gross profits\n________________________________\nAdjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure explained above.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\nTotal revenues and direct costs.\nGlobal Forwarding total revenues and direct costs increased, driven by higher pricing and purchased transportation costs in ocean services in addition to volume increases across all global forwarding transportation services. The higher pricing and purchased transportation costs in ocean services were driven by the volatile market conditions in 2024 discussed in the market trends section above, which significantly impacted carrier capacity and led to increased ocean freight rates in 2024. Additionally, disruptions in the ocean freight market resulted in increased air freight tonnage in 2024, driven by ocean freight conversions in many trade lanes. These ocean freight conversions, coupled with heightened ecommerce demand out of North Asia and stronger peak season volumes compared to 2023, elevated air freight costs in certain trade lanes in 2024. The volatile market conditions in 2024 contrasted with the weak demand, elevated capacity, and suppressed freight rates experienced in 2023.\nGross profits and adjusted gross profits.\nGlobal Forwarding adjusted gross profits increased, driven by higher adjusted gross profits per shipment and an increase in volumes in ocean services driven by the challenges facing the global forwarding market, which resulted in elevated pricing. This compared to a market characterized by weak freight demand and excess carrier capacity in 2023. Air freight adjusted gross profits increased due an increase in metric tons shipped which was partially offset by lower adjusted gross profits per metric ton shipped. The decrease in adjusted gross profits per metric ton shipped, was driven by sharp increases to the cost of air freight in certain trade lanes during 2024 compared to 2023. Customs adjusted gross profits increased, driven by higher transaction volumes and an increase in adjusted gross profits per transaction.\nPersonnel expenses increased primarily due to increased variable compensation reflecting the improved results relative to the prior year. This increase was partially offset by cost optimization efforts, including lower average employee headcount. Other SG&A expenses decreased, as the prior year included an $18.0 million loss related to the divestiture of our Argentina operations. Additionally, other SG&A expenses declined in the current year related to lower allocated corporate expenses and lower amortization expenses following the completion of amortization of intangible assets from a prior acquisition. These decreases were partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses as the prior year benefited from a reduction to the allowance for credit losses.\nIn addition to the above, personnel expenses for 2024 included $6.9 million of severance and related personnel expenses. We also incurred $4.7 million in other SG&A expenses in 2024. These expenses were both associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program. Personnel expenses for 2023 included $3.8 million of severance and related personnel expenses. Other SG&A in 2023 included $18.2 million primarily related to disposal and exit activities, including asset impairments. These expenses were associated with our 2022 Restructuring Program and the divestiture of our Argentina operations. Refer to Note 14,\n, for further discussion related to our 2024 and 2022 Restructuring Programs. Refer to Note 15,\n, for further discussion related to the divestiture of our Argentina operations.\nAll Other and Corporate Segment Results of Operations\nAll Other and Corporate includes our Robinson Fresh and Managed Solutions segments, as well as Other Surface Transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\nLoss from operations\nN/M\nN/M\nAdjusted gross profits\nOther Surface Transportation\nTotal adjusted gross profits\n________________________________\nAdjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure explained above.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\nTotal revenues and direct costs.\nTotal revenues and direct costs increased, driven by higher average pricing with retail customers and increased case volume with foodservice customers in our Robinson Fresh business. This increase was partially offset by a decline in European truckload pricing and volume in our Other Surface Transportation business resulting in a decline in total revenues and direct costs.\nGross profits and adjusted gross profits.\nRobinson Fresh adjusted gross profits increased due to an increase in integrated supply chain solutions for retail and foodservice customers. Managed Solutions adjusted gross profits decreased due to lower transaction volume. Other Surface Transportation adjusted gross profits decreased primarily due to a decrease in adjusted gross profits per transaction in European truckload and a decrease in European truckload volumes.\nPersonnel expenses in 2024, for All Other and Corporate included $7.0 million of severance and related personnel expenses primarily associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program. We also incurred $54.5 million of other SG&A expenses in 2024, that included a $44.5 million loss related to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business. Personnel expenses in 2023, included $13.5 million of severance and related personnel expenses. We also incurred $1.5 million of other SG&A expenses in 2023. These expenses were associated with our 2022 Restructuring Program and the divestiture of our Argentina operations. Refer to Note 14,\nfor further discussion related to our 2024 and 2022 Restructuring Programs. Refer to Note 15,\n, for further discussion related to the divestitures of our Europe Surface Transportation business and Argentina operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe have historically generated substantial cash from operations, which has enabled us to fund our organic growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock. In addition, we maintain the following debt facilities as described in Note 4,\nFinancing Arrangements\n(dollars in thousands):\nCarrying Value as of December 31, 2024\nRevolving Credit Facility\nSenior Notes, Series B\nSenior Notes, Series C\nReceivables Securitization Facility\n________________________________\nNet of unamortized discounts and issuance costs.\nWe expect to use our current debt facilities and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future to assist us in continuing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases, or other investments.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $145.8 million as of December 31, 2024, and $145.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States totaled $134.0 million as of December 31, 2024, and $142.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Working capital decreased from $828.7 million at December 31, 2023, to $644.7 million at December 31, 2024.\nWe prioritize our investments to grow our market share and expand globally in key industries, trade lanes, and geographies, and to digitize our customer, carrier, and internal tools to support our organic growth. We are continually looking for acquisitions, but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities.\nThe following table summarizes our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents (dollars in thousands):\nTwelve months ended December 31,\nSources (uses) of cash:\nCash provided by operating activities\nCapital expenditures\nSale of property and equipment\nCash used for investing activities\nRepurchase of common stock\nNet (repayments) borrowings on debt\nOther financing activities\nNet cash used for financing activities\nEffect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents, including cash and cash equivalents classified within assets held for sale\nCash flow from operating activities.\nWe generated significant cash flow from operating activities in 2024, driven by our strong operating results and increased net income. The increase to net income was offset by elevated freight rates in ocean services, driven by the factors discussed in the market trends and business trends sections above, which resulted in an increase in net operating working capital and negatively impacted our cash flow from operations. In 2023, our results were adversely impacted by weak freight demand and excess carrier capacity, which significantly decreased our net operating working capital and benefited our cash flow from operations. We continue to closely monitor credit and collections activities and the quality of our accounts receivable balance to minimize risk as well as work with our customers to facilitate the movement of goods across their supply chains while also ensuring timely payment.\nCash used for investing activities.\nOur investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions. Capital expenditures consisted primarily of investments in software, which are intended to deliver scalable solutions by transforming our processes, accelerating the pace of development, prioritizing data integrity, improving our customer and carrier experience, and increasing our efficiency to help expand our adjusted operating margins and grow the business.\nDuring 2022, we sold an office building in Kansas City, Missouri, for a sales price of $55.0 million and recognized a gain of $23.5 million on the sale. We simultaneously entered into an agreement to lease the office building for 10 years.\nWe anticipate capital expenditures in 2025 to be approximately $75 million to $85 million.\n",
