Annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the long-term nature of the contracts. As such, beginning total backlog, plus orders, minus revenues, will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations, and other factors. Typically, capital projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays occur from time to time. Total backlog was $4,819 million at September 30, 2025, a decrease of $434 million, or 8.3%, as compared to September 30, 2024 backlog of $5,253 million. The decrease in backlog was driven by increased revenue outpacing order intake and contract wins in the current period, partially offset by favorable impacts from foreign currency translation. The backlog decrease was led by the Measurement and Control Solutions and Water Solutions and Services segments due to strong backlog execution and improved lead times. These backlog declines were partially offset by backlog growth in the Water Infrastructure and Applied Water segments primarily due to orders and contract wins outpacing revenue, and favorable foreign currency impacts. Backlog decreased $251 million, or 5.0%, at September 30, 2025, as compared to December 31, 2024 backlog of $5,070 million. We anticipate that approximately 30% of the backlog as of September 30, 2025 will be recognized as revenue in the remainder of 2025. There were no significant order cancellations during the quarter.\nGross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 160 basis points t\n38.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to 37.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The gross margin increase was partially offset by unfavorable impacts of 20 basis points from increases in acquired intangible amortization and restructuring and realignment costs as compared to the prior year. Gross margin expansion was driven by 430 basis points of favorable operational impacts, led by 230 basis points of productivity savings and 140 basis points of price realization. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by 250 basis points of unfavorable operational impacts driven by 200 basis points of inflation and 40 basis points of unfavorable mix.\nGross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 100 basis points to 38.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to 37.3% for the nine months ended\n2024. The gross margin increase included favorable impacts of 20 basis points from decreases in acquired intangible amortization and special charges, partially offset by increased restructuring and realignment charges as compared to the prior year. Gross margin expansion included favorable operational impacts of 360 basis points, driven almost entirely by 220 basis points of productivity savings and 130 basis points of price realization. These increases in gross margin were offset by 280 basis points of unfavorable operational impacts driven by 190 basis points of inflation and 70 basis points of unfavorable mix.\n\nRefer to Note 9, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" for more information on intangible asset impairment charges incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2025.\nOperating Income, Net Income, and Adjusted EBITDA\nOperating income was $334 million (operating margin of 14.7%) during the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $54 million, or 19.3%, when compared to operating income of $280 million (operating margin of 13.3%) during the prior year. Operating margin increased 140 basis points. Operating margin expansion was partially offset by 90 basis points of unfavorable impacts from increased restructuring and realignment costs, acquired intangible amortization, and special charges relative to the prior year period. Additionally, operating margin expansion included 560 basis points of favorable operational impacts driven by 320 basis points of productivity savings and 190 basis points of price realization. These favorable impacts were partially offset by 330 basis points of unfavorable operational impacts, driven by 230 basis points of inflation, 40 basis points of increased spending on strategic investments, and 40 basis points of unfavorable mix. Excluding acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring and realignment costs, and special charges, adjusted operating income was $429 million (adjusted operating margin of 18.9%) for the third quarter of 2025 as compared to adjusted operating income of $350 million (adjusted operating margin of 16.6%) during the comparable quarter in the prior year.\nNet income attributable to Xylem for the third quarter was $227 million (net income margin of 10.0%), an increase of $10 million as compared to net income attributable to Xylem in the prior year of $217 million (net income margin of 10.3%). The increase in net income attributable to Xylem was driven by increased operating income of $54 million, increased non-operating income of $5 million, decreased interest expense of $4 million, and the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of $1 million, partially offset by increased loss from sale of businesses of $35 million and increased income tax expense of $19 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $527 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.2%) during the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $80 million, or 18.0%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $447 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.2%) during the comparable quarter in the prior year, an increase to adjusted EBITDA margin of 200 basis points. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by the same factors impacting the adjusted operating margin increase.\nOperating income was $870 million (operating margin of 13.1%) during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $128 million, or 17.3%, when compared to operating income of $742 million (operating margin of 11.8%) during the prior year. Operating margin increased 130 basis points, which included net unfavorable impacts of 30 basis points from increased restructuring and realignment costs and acquired intangible amortization, slightly offset by decreased special charges compared to the prior year. Additionally, operating margin expansion included 560 basis points of favorable operational impacts driven by 350 basis points of productivity savings and 170 basis points of price realization. These favorable impacts were partially offset by 400 basis points of unfavorable operational impacts, driven by 240 basis points of inflation, 70 basis points of unfavorable mix, and 40 basis points of increased spending on strategic investments. Excluding acquired intangible asset amortization, restructuring and realignment costs, and special charges, adjusted operating income was $1,156 million (adjusted operating margin of 17.4%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to adjusted operating income of $996 million (adjusted operating margin of 15.8%) during the comparable period in the prior year.\n\ncompared to adjusted operating income of $94 million (adjusted operating margin of 16.3%) for the third quarter of 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $167 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.3%) for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $25 million, or 18%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $142 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7%) during the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to the same factors as those impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin; however, adjusted EBITDA margin did not benefit from the relative impact of decrease in depreciation and software amortization.\nOperating income for our Water Solutions and Services segment was $220 million (operating margin of 12.1%) during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $60 million, or 37.5%, when compared to operating income of $160 million (operating margin of 9.2%) during the prior year, or a total increase in operating margin of 290 basis points. Operating margin expansion included net favorable impacts of 180 basis points due to decreases in restructuring and realignment costs and special charges, partially offset by increases in acquired intangible asset amortization as compared to the prior year. Additionally, operating margin expansion included 440 basis points of favorable operational impacts, driven by 210 basis points of price realization, 120 basis points of productivity savings, and 40 basis points of increased volume. Margin expansion was offset by negative operational impacts of 330 basis points driven by 170 basis points of inflation, 60 basis points of unfavorable mix, and 30 basis points of inventory management costs. Excluding acquired intangible asset amortization, special charges, and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $311 million (adjusted operating margin of 17.0%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to adjusted operating income of $276 million (adjusted operating margin of 15.9%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $442 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.2%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $32 million, or 8%, when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $410 million (adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.6%) during the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased due to the same factors as those impacting the increase in adjusted operating margin; however, adjusted EBITDA margin did not benefit from the impact of essentially flat depreciation and software amortization expense relative to increased revenue.\nOperating loss for corporate and other increased $10 million, or 62.5%, during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the prior year period. Operating loss increased primarily due to increased spending on and "
